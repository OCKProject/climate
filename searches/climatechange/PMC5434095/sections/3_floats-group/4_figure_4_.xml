  <p class="p">No overall relationship was observed between climatic conditions and the numbers of species showing extreme population responses. Relationships between the proportion of species experiencing an extreme response (either population crashes or explosion) in each year and three-dimensional distance from the climate-PCA origin (
   <italic class="italic">a</italic>,
   <italic class="italic">b</italic>), drought index (
   <italic class="italic">c</italic>,
   <italic class="italic">d</italic>) and daily minimum temperature of the coldest 30 days (
   <italic class="italic">e</italic>,
   <italic class="italic">f</italic>) are shown. Lepidoptera are represented by black circles and birds by grey squares; each symbol represents 1 year. The lags are measured in years, with lag 0 representing the climate measured in the current year, i.e. population changes from 1968â€“1969 were related to the climate in 1968 (lag = 1 year) and/or 1969 (no lag).
