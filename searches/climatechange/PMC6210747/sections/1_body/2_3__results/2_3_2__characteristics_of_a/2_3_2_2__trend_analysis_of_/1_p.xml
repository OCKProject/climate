 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref> shows the annual movement law of the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour. The variance range of the longitude was about 0.57°, and the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour showed a westward shifting trend with a rate of −0.032°/10 years. The variance range of the latitude was about 0.44°, and the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contours showed a northward shifting trend with a rate of 0.01°/10 years. The Kendall rank correlation coefficients of longitude and latitude spatial displacement were −0.2208 and 0.19354, respectively, which were both not significant.
