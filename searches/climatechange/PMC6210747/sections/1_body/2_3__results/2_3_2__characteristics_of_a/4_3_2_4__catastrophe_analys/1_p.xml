 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f014" class="xref">Figure 14</xref>) were used to test the spatial displacement of the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour. According to the Yamamoto method, no strong catastrophe point was found in the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour series, neither in the meridional direction nor in the zonal direction. Combined with the test results of Manner-Kendall method, it was concluded that catastrophe point of the longitude of the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour in Naqu Prefecture was from 1966 to 1967, while it was from 2005 to 2006 in the zonal direction.
