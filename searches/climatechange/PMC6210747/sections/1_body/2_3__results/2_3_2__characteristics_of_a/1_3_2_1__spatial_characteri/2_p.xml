<p class="p">Similar to the analysis method of multi-year average annual precipitation, the longitudinal profile of the gradient direction of the multi-year average accumulated temperature contour was taken as the reference surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>a) to analyze the distribution of elevation and annual accumulated temperature on the profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>b). Unlike the precipitation, the areas with high accumulated temperature were distributed in the relatively high or even the highest altitude areas, while the areas with the lowest accumulated temperature distributed in the lowest altitude area. The areas with the annual average accumulated temperature from 200 °C to 800 °C and the elevation from 4700 m to 5100 m covered the largest area. The longitudinal profile of this part shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>b accounted for about 1/2 of the length of the entire longitudinal profile.
