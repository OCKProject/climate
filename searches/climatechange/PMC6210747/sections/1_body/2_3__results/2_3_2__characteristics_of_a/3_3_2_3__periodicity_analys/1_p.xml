<p class="p">From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>, it can be inferred that the corresponding frequency of the meridional maximum power point was 2.42, and the corresponding period length was about 2.8 years, and corresponding frequency of the secondary meridional maximum power point was 1.51 with a corresponding period length of 7 years. That was to say, the meridional movement of the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour had a 2.8-year period and a 7-year sub-period. The zonal movement of the center point of the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour had no significant period.
