<p class="p">According to the zoning map of comprehensive suitability of precipitation and temperature obtained by the method mentioned in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot5-ijerph-15-02271" class="xref">Section 2.5</xref>, we can find that the suitability of vegetation growth hydrothermal conditions in Naqu Prefecture deteriorated gradually from the southeast to the northwest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f015" class="xref">Figure 15</xref>). Considering the displacement of the precipitation and accumulated temperature contours analyzed in the former sections, the center of the precipitation and accumulated temperature contours all shifted toward northwest, it is concluded that, areas with suitable hydrothermal conditions for vegetation growth in Naqu Prefecture will tend to shift toward the northwest in the future.
