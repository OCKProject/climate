 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02271-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> represent the average annual precipitation and accumulated temperature in the same vegetation zone of China, and the “difference” represents the difference of temperature or precipitation minus the national value between Naqu Prefecture and other places of China in the same vegetation zone. It can be seen from 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02271-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> that when in the same vegetation zone, the annual precipitation in Naqu Prefecture was generally higher than the national average, and the difference range was about 17 mm to 129 mm; while the accumulated temperature level was generally lower than the national average, the difference range was about −35 °C to −1338 °C. It was speculated from the above results that the same vegetation may require more precipitation and less accumulated temperature when grown in alpine regions, when the isothermal line of accumulated temperature and precipitation was spatially displaced, there may be a spatial redistribution of vegetation zones in Naqu Prefecture.
