 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f008" class="xref">Figure 8</xref>) were used to test the spatial displacement of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour. According to the Yamamoto method, no strong catastrophe point was found in the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour series, neither in the meridional direction nor in the zonal direction. Combined with the test result of the Manner-Kendall method, it was concluded that thebcatastrophe point of the longitude of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour in Naqu Prefecture was around 1996, while there was no catastrophe point in the zonal direction.
