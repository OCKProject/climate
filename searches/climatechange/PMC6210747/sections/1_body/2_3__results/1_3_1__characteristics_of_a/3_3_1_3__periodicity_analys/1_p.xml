 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> plotted the spectrum graph of the spatial displacement of the 500 mm precipitation contour obtained by the maximum entropy spectrum analysis method. The corresponding frequency of the meridional maximum power point was 1.23, and the corresponding period length was about 3.3 years, that is to say, the meridional movement of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour had a 3.3-year cycle. The corresponding frequency of the zonal maximum power point was 1.37, and the corresponding period length was about 7.1 years, that is, the zonal movement of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour had a 7.1-year cycle.
