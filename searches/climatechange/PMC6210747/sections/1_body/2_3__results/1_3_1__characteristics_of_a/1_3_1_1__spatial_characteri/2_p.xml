<p class="p">In our study, the longitudinal profile of the gradient direction of the multi-year average precipitation contour was taken as the reference surface (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a) to analyze the distribution of elevation and annual precipitation on the profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>b). The results showed that, along this longitudinal profile, the areas with the highest and lowest annual precipitation were located at the high-altitude areas in the region. The areas with annual average precipitation of 250 to 400 mm and elevation of 4500 to 4800 m covered the largest area. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>, it can be learned that the longitudinal profile of this part accounted for about 1/2 of the length of the entire longitudinal profile.
