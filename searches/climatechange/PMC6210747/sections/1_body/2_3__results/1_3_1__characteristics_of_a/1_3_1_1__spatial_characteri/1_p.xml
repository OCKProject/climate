<p class="p">From 1961 to 2011, the mean annual precipitation in China was 589 mm, and 342 mm in Tibet, while it was 330 mm in Naqu Prefecture, i.e., only 56% of the national average level. The mean annual precipitation of Naqu Prefecture decreased successively from the northwest area (the highest value was 720 mm per year) to the southeast area (the lowest value was 42 mm per year). The areas with mean annual precipitation of more than 500 mm were located at the southeast of Naqu Prefecture, accounting for about 12.4% of the prefecture area. On an inter-decadal time-scale, the 500 mm precipitation contour presented a slight shift to the southeast in the 1970s, and then shifted to the northwest after the 1980s (
