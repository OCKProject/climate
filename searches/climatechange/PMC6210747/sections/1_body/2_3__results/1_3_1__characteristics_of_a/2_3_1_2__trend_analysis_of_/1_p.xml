 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02271-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> plots the annual movement law of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation contour from 1961 to 2011. The variance range of the longitude was about 1.67°, and the 500 mm precipitation contours showed a westward shifting trend, with a rate of −0.29°/10 years. The variance range of the latitude was about 4.23°, and the 500 mm precipitation contour showed a northward shifting trend with a rate of 0.05°/10-years. The Kendall rank correlation coefficients of longitude and latitude spatial displacement were −0.1498 and 0.1624, respectively, and they were both non-significant.
