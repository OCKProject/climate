<p class="p">Most of the previous studies on precipitation focused on the change of annual precipitation and the 400 mm precipitation contour [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The main reason is that the 400 mm precipitation contour is the demarcation line between semi-humid and semi-arid regions, forest vegetation and grassland, cultivated civilization and nomadic civilization, planting and animal husbandry in China [

Moreover, there was only few coniferous forests distributed in areas with annual precipitation of more than 500 mm in the region. According to related research [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] on the accumulated temperature demand of vegetation in alpine areas, 2000 °C accumulated temperature (of those daily temperature higher than 10 °C) was needed yearly during the whole growth season of vegetation. Hence, we choose the 500 mm precipitation and 2000 °C accumulated temperature as the threshold of the suitable hydrothermal conditions in this study.
