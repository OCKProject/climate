Accumulated temperature can reflect the temperature impact on vegetation growth from two aspects, action time and action intensity, hence, the change of accumulated temperature is more essential to vegetation change. Previous studies have shown that 10 °C is the lower limit temperature for the growth of most vegetation, and an accumulated temperature of more than 10 °C is an important factor affecting vegetation growth and a key caloric indicator for measuring crop yields [
