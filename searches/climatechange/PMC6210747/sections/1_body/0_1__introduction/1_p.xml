<p class="p">Naqu Prefecture is located at the intersection of the South China Sea and the Indian Ocean water vapor streams. It is significantly affected by climate change, thus profoundly affecting the dynamics of the surface circulation field and the changes in surface cover. Naqu Prefecture is the water resource conservation areas and ecological barrier construction area of the Nujiang River and Eastern Tibet. However, it has a strong dependence on hydrothermal conditions with fragile vegetation. It is of great importance to analyze the suitability of hydrothermal conditions for vegetation growth in this area. This study can provide references for the ecological barrier construction, water resources protection and addressing the effects of climate change.</p>
