<p class="p">The main objectives of our study were to: (i) reveal the changes of annual precipitation and accumulated temperature (of those daily temperature higher than 10 °C); (ii) analyze the spatial characteristics of the 500 mm precipitation and the 2000 °C accumulated temperature; (iii) describe the response of the ecosystem to them from the aspects of trend, periodicity and abruptness systematically. Our study provides support for related research on the spatial change of vegetation types, and also provides references for the ecological environment management in the Tibetan Plateau, where is a lack of data and information.</p>
