<p class="p">To reveal the changes of annual precipitation and accumulated temperature (of daily temperatures higher than 10 °C), we analyzed the spatial characteristics of the 500 mm precipitation and the 2000 °C accumulated temperature, and also the response of the ecosystem to these factors from the perspectives of trend, periodicity and abruptness was systematically explored. The results showed that:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">On the interdecadal scale, the 500 mm annual precipitation contour in Naqu Prefecture showed a slight shift to the southeast in the 1970s, then shifted to the northwest in the 1980s. The 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour showed an offset to the northwest in the 1970s and 1980s, and moved back to the southeast in the 1990s, then continued to move southward after the 2000s.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The 500 mm annual precipitation contour presented a westward shifting trend and a southward shifting trend in longitude and latitude, respectively. The coordinate of the center point of the contour had a 3.3-year period and a 7.1-year period in longitude and latitude, respectively. The longitude of the center point had a catastrophe point around 1996, while there was no catastrophe point in the zonal direction.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The 2000 °C accumulated temperature contour showed no significant westward and northward shifting trend in the meridional and zonal directions. The center point of the contour had a 2.8-year period and a 7-year sub-period in the meridional direction, while there was no significant period in the zonal direction. The longitude of the center point had a mutation point between 1966 and 1967, and the latitude had a catastrophe point between 2005 and 2006.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">When in the same vegetation zone, the annual precipitation in Naqu Prefecture was generally 17 mm to 129 mm higher than the national average, while the accumulated temperature level is generally 35 °C to 1338 °C lower than the national average. It was speculated that the same vegetation may require more precipitation and less accumulated temperature when grown in alpine regions. When the accumulated temperature and precipitation are spatially displaced, there may be a spatial redistribution of vegetation zones in Naqu Prefecture.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">At present, the hydrothermal conditions suitability of vegetation growth in Naqu Prefecture gradually got worse from southeast to northwest. In the future, affected by the spatial displacement of precipitation and accumulated temperature, the areas with suitable hydrothermal conditions suitable for vegetation growth show a northwestward shifting tendency.</p>
