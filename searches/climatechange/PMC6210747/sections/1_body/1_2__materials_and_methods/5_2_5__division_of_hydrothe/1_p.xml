<p class="p">According to the two key elements of precipitation and accumulated temperature, which can reflect regional hydrothermal conditions, and they were sensitive to vegetation growth, so the zoning map of comprehensive suitability of precipitation and temperature can be obtained by using the reclassify and superposition calculation on the ArcGIS platform. In this reclassify method, the precipitation and accumulated temperature were divided into Grade 1 to 10 with increasing order, the 10th grade indicated the area with the highest precipitation or the highest accumulated temperature. The higher the grade, the higher the suitability. The precipitation and accumulated temperature levels were superimposed one by one on the grid unit, and the appropriate level of hydrothermal conditions in the study area can be obtained.</p>
