<p class="p">To analyze the trend, periodicity and abruptness of the space displacements of the 500 mm precipitation contour and the accumulated temperature contour, their motivations were decomposed into two directions: the meridional direction and zonal direction. Among them, the trend was explored by using the Kendall rank correlation test [
