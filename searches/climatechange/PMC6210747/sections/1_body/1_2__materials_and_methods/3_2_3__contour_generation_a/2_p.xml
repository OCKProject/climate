<p class="p">In this study, the weighted average space coordinates of the precipitation contours were used to characterize their spatial positions. On the ArcGIS platform, the accumulated temperature and precipitation contours were discretized into points, and the weighted average coordinates of the latitude and longitude of these discrete points were calculated, which were the weighted average space coordinates we used. The annual change of the weighted average position (center point coordinates) of the contour lines reflects the holistic spatial displacement characteristics of the accumulated temperature and precipitation contour.</p>
