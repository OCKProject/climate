<p class="p">By comparing various spatial interpolation methods, we finally chose the Co-Kriging interpolation method (COK) which has been widely used in practice [

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. We interpolated the raster surface with a spatial resolution of 5 km × 5 km from points data of the annual accumulated temperature and precipitation by using the Kriging tool of ArcGIS (Version 10.2, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA). Based on the raster surface of the accumulated temperature and precipitation, the Contour tool in the ArcGIS toolbox was used to generate the 2000 °C accumulated temperature and the 500 mm precipitation contours, then the most continuous contours with the largest distribution of the latitude and longitude were finally selected.
