<p class="p">According to the zoning map of comprehensive suitability of precipitation and temperature, the suitability of vegetation growth hydrothermal conditions in Naqu Prefecture deteriorated gradually from the southeast to the northwest. There was scant evidence for the interactive effect of warming and precipitation change on ecosystem respiration [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Previous studies had shown that precipitation and temperature can change the NDVI [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], and they can also affect the growth process of plants, such as seed germination [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] confirmed the large spatial variability of trends in extreme precipitation indices in Tibet, and this might be affected by the surface coverage [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], which meaning that the climate change and ecosystem influence each other. Considering the displacement of the precipitation and accumulated temperature contours analyzed in the former sections, the center of the precipitation and accumulated temperature contours all shifted toward northwest, it is concluded that, areas with suitable hydrothermal conditions for vegetation growth in Naqu Prefecture will tend to shift toward the northwest in the future. This finding can provide guidelines for plant ecological system protection and climate change adaptation.
