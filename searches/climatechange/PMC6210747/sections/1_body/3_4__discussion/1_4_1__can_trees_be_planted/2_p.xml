 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot2-ijerph-15-02271" class="xref">Section 3.2</xref>, the 500 mm precipitation and the 2000 °C accumulated temperature contours all shifted in both the longitude and latitude directions. This may be affected by the variation of South China Sea and the Indian Ocean water vapor streams [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Our results are in line with previous studies about the precipitation and temperature variation characteristics [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. We also analyzed the periodicity and catastrophe of the center point of the 500 mm precipitation and 2000 °C accumulated temperature contours, and the results showed that they both have a significant moving period and catastrophe point in the longitude and latitude directions, thu indicating that in the future, under climate change conditions, the hydrothermal conditions in Naqu Prefecture may change resoundly, and there might be some areas that become suitable for trees and forest growth. This conclusion is also applicable for other regions with a similar environment on Earth.
