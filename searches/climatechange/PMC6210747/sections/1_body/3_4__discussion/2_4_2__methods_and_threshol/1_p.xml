<p class="p">As is shown in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02271-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, for the growth of the existing vegetation in Naqu Prefecture, the same kind of vegetation may need more precipitation and lower accumulated temperature compared with the national average level. This phenomenon is probably affected by the specially high elevation, low air pressure, long-wave radiation, short-wave radiation, etc. in Tibet. Temperature and precipitation also affect the vegetation phenology and the start date of the growth season in different areas [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], as the threshold of accumulated temperature and precipitation varies in different environments and areas [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-02271" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Hence, we point out that while we canâ€™t determine whether the hydrothermal conditions are suitable for vegetation growth in alpine areas and high-altitude areas by conventional analysis, we should explore methods and thresholds aiming at these specific areas. For example, when considering the impact of precipitaion, the ratio of rain and snow, the distribution and variation of permafrost should also be taken into account, as they can also affect the distribution of swamps and grasslands [
