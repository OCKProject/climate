<p id="Par13" class="p">Hatching success varied spatially and temporally across all years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Rio de Janeiro had the highest average hatching success (78.6% ± 19.7), followed by Espirito Santo (78.5% ± 19.3), and Bahia (73.8% ± 19.3). There was a significant difference in hatching success between nesting states across years (ANOVA, DF = 2, F = 142, p &lt; 0.01). The post-hoc test, Tukey HSD, identified a significant difference in hatching success between Bahia and Espirito Santo (p &lt; 0.01) as well as between Bahia and Rio de Janeiro (p &lt; 0.01). No significant difference in hatching success was found between Espirito Santo and Rio de Janeiro (p = 0.998).
