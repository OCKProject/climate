<p id="Par18" class="p">Overall, the best GAM for hatching success within the entire region was average air temperature during incubation in combination with accumulated rainfall during incubation (deviance = 8.94%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Both air temperature and precipitation were significant (p &lt; 0.01 for both parameters), but their relationships are unclear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). This same model had the lowest Corrected Akaike Information Criterion (AICc) value across emergence rate models throughout the region (deviance = 14.2%; Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Average air temperature during incubation had a non-significant negative effect on emergence rate (p = 0.27), while accumulated rainfall during incubation had a highly significant and negative effect on emergence rate (p &lt; 0.01; Table
