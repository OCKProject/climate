<p id="Par17" class="p">The nesting season for loggerhead turtles in Brazil takes place during the warmest and wetter months of the year, September – March. During the nesting season, Rio de Janeiro is the most humid state with March being the most humid month, correlating with the lowest nesting activity in the state (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). In contrast, in Espirito Santo and Bahia, November is the most humid month, correlating with a peak in nesting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). January and February had the highest solar radiation, coinciding with low nesting across all states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). Rio de Janeiro has the most rainfall with December experiencing a peak in both rainfall and nesting activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). In Bahia and Espirito Santo, peak rainfall occurs in the early, October, and late, February, stages of their nesting seasons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d</xref>). Like air temperature, months with the coolest, September and October, and warmest, February and March, SST correspond to the lowest nesting across states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a,e</xref>). Months with the lowest average wind speed in Bahia and Espirito Santo coincides with the lowest nesting, whereas January and February have the highest average wind speeds in Rio de Janeiro, but the lowest nesting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4f</xref>).
