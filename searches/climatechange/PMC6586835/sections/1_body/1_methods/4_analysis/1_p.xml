<p id="Par9" class="p">Hatching success and emergence rate data were arcsin transformed to normalize the data. A one-way ANOVA was used to compare hatching success and emergence rate at each state and across nesting beaches within states. The Levene test with center mean was used to test homogeneity of variances in hatching success and emergence rate. The Tukey Honest Significant Difference (TukeyHSD) test was used for hatching success because variances in the data met the assumption of homogeneity (p = 0.101). Tamhane’s test was used for emergence rate because variances in data were not homogenous (p = &lt; 2.2 e-16). ANOVAs on hatching success and the Levene’s test were completed in R version 3.3.2. Version 24 of IBM SPSS Statistics was used to complete the one-way ANOVA and Tamhane’s tests used for emergence rate.</p>
