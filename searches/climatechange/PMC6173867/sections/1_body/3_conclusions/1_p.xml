<p id="Par53" class="p">Our experimental results, obtained in controlled environment conditions, support the hypothesis that photoperiodic induction of dormancy is successful within a 24-12 °C temperature-window (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). This might also be a valid approximation for the natural environment. Even though early bud set seems to unnecessarily shorten the growing season, it serves the overall optimization of winter preparations and growth in the next season. At growth-promoting temperatures and relatively long photoperiods photosynthetic capacity and phloem transport can be maintained at a high level, allowing proper bud development, the filling of reserve stores, as well as the acquisition of freezing-tolerance and floral competence. Pre-dormancy chilling as well as unseasonal warm periods can impede the scheduled winter preparations, thereby reducing survival and reproductive success. We conclude that the mechanisms that induce and release dormancy operate simultaneously and antagonistically when plants are exposed to low temperature under short photoperiod. Global warming and erratic temperature patterns may therefore interfere with seasonal cycling and compromise overall fitness of photoperiodic ecotypes.
