<p id="Par4" class="p">Deciduous trees in temperate areas have a surprisingly short growing season. At northern latitudes, most of their lives are spent in a leafless state and exposed to low temperatures. Preparation for the winter requires multiple developmental adjustments, which are informed by the sequential decline in photoperiod and temperature. Photoperiod changes predictably during the Earth’s motion around the sun, and photoperiodic ecotypes exploit this regularity as an unambiguous measure of seasonal progression. The gradual shift in photoperiod and solar angle, and the corresponding change in radiation, drive the annual thermal cycle that determines the latitudinal and altitudinal distribution of plants [
