<p id="Par10" class="p">At the morphogenetic level, TB development follows a predictable scenario. In the active shoot apical meristem (SAM) all cells participate in a gated symplasmic network that functionally and dynamically integrates cellular activities. We proposed a model in which the SAM is the organizer of primary development as well as the specific locus of dormancy [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. We showed that under short photoperiod, callosic Dormancy Sphincter Complexes (DSC) close off plasmodesmata. These specialized DSC act as circuit breakers in the symplasmic circuitry of the SAM, blocking signal exchange as well as metabolic and electrical coupling, and dissipating supracellular surveillance and coordination [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Subsequently, cellular activities diminish as membrane potentials drop, and metabolism and gene expression change as part of the acclimation process. Remarkably, this symplasmic shutdown is reversed by chilling-induced removal of DSC callose. As a result, the symplasmic network is restored, enabling renewed cell-cell communication once rising temperature gears up metabolism [
