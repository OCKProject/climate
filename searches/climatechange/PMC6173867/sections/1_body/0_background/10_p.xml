<p id="Par13" class="p">The question if temperature influences the photoperiodic response that results in bud dormancy has a certain urgency in the context of climate change and the inherently unstable weather patterns. Decoupling of photo- and thermoperiod might present trees with conflicting environmental information, which could putatively diminish tree performance and survival in the long term. It is conceivable that unseasonal low and high temperatures could adversely affect the establishment of dormant buds. To address these possibilities, we exposed juvenile hybrid aspens (

 <italic class="italic">P. tremuloides</italic>) to short photoperiod at four different day/night (D/N) temperature regimes: high (D/N 24/24 °C), moderate (D/N 18/18 °C), moderate-low (D/N 18/12 °C), and low (D/N 12/12 °C). We investigated TB initiation, AXB development, and bud dormancy establishment as well as the expression of marker genes. A main finding is that even mildly low temperatures (12 °C) during the bud-formation phase adversely affect the scheduling of the distinct phases of the dormancy cycle. Importantly, it diminishes bud-quality, prematurely triggers genes of the dormancy-release mechanism, and perturbs transcription of key vernalization pathway genes. Furthermore, at a high temperature (24 °C), the developing TBs flush regularly, and fail to establish dormancy. Our analyses of the critical photoperiod of given ecotypes in combination with local weather data support the hypothesis that natural
