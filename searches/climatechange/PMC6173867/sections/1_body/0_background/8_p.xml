<p id="Par11" class="p">The mechanisms by which photoperiod and chilling trigger the symplasmic alterations in the SAM have been investigated in detail in birch and hybrid aspen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. Since a main constituent of the DSC is callose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], the balance between 1,3-β-glucan synthases and 1,3-β-glucanases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] is crucial in establishing and releasing dormancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. The callose-hydrolysing 1,3-β-glucanases (family GH17) are diversified into an α-, β- and γ-clade [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. In hybrid aspen, the studied growth-related α-clade enzymes are downregulated, whereas γ-clade members are upregulated during bud formation as well as during chilling-induced dormancy release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Crucially, the growth-related α-clade members are inducible by GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, while bud-related γ-clade members are responsive to GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. The γ-clade enzymes localize at lipid bodies that accumulate in developing buds, and are displaced by chilling to plasmodesmata where they can remove callose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. As this cellular mechanism is recruited by chilling, this raises the question if low temperature in the pre-dormancy phase could do the same, thereby counteracting installation of DSC and antagonizing establishment of dormancy.
