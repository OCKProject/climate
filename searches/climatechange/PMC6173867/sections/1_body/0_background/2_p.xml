<p id="Par5" class="p">Many tree species are adapted to respond to critical short photoperiods, which are longer toward the North, resulting in shorter growing seasons at high latitudes [

 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salix</italic> populations that are adapted to latitudes in the far North, initiate terminal buds (TBs) at a surprisingly long 22-h photoperiod, whereas southern ecotypes continue to grow until daylengths decrease to 15Â h [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. For this reason, ecotypes do not prosper far outside their latitude. Changes in the annual thermal cycle are expected to challenge the adaptive mechanisms on which these ecotypes depend. As global warming tends to drive the geographic distribution of species towards the North, they could initiate winter preparations belatedly, according to the critical photoperiod of their origin, falling victim to arriving frost.
