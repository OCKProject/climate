<p id="Par45" class="p">Despite the activation of GA-biosynthesis, buds remain suppressed at low temperature, indicating that antagonistic factors are operational. A prominent inhibitor of bud activation is strigolactone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Strigolactone biosynthesis gene 
 <italic class="italic">MAX1</italic> and the strigolactone signalling gene 
 <italic class="italic">MAX2</italic> are upregulated during AXB development, together with the downstream targets 
 <italic class="italic">BRC1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">BRC2</italic>, indicating that they collectively contribute to the suppression of buds in different 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>]. The current data show that pre-dormancy chilling further upregulates these inhibitory pathways (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>). The strigolactone pathway is thus not only involved in suppressing burst of para-dormant AXBs, but also in repressing AXBs that are released from dormancy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b, d</xref>). That low temperature intersects with the strigolactone pathway might be more general, as it is also found in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> and pea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>].
