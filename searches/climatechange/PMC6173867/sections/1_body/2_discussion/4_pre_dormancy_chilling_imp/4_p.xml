<p id="Par44" class="p">That during pre-dormancy chilling buds failed to downregulate 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), which is characteristic of the dormant state [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>], could be due to the elevated GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> levels. Indeed, GA-feeding experiments showed that particularly GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> strongly upregulated 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic> in dormant, para-dormant and released buds, while 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> was only upregulated by GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> in para-dormant buds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). This contrasting induction of 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> with different GAs suggests differential gene regulation and epigenetic states. The distinct nature of GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>- and GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>-induced effects on bud burst and gene expression is striking, and warrants further investigation.
