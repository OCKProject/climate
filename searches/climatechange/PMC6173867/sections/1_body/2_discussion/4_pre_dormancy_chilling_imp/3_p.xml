<p id="Par43" class="p">The enhanced expression of the GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-regulated 1,3-Î²-glucanases during pre-dormancy chilling is congruent with the simultaneous upregulation of the GA-biosynthesis and signalling genes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). That GA-catabolism was also enhanced (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>), like in dormancy release [
