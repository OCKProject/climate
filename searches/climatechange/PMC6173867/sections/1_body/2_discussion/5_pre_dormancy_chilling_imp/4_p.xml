<p id="Par49" class="p">Despite the activation of floral pathway genes in chilled dormant buds, juvenile poplars do not transition to flowering, suggesting that inhibiting factors are present, including CENL1/TFL1. The balance of FT/TFL1 is believed to determine multiple aspects of growth and flowering [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. For example, in young 
 <italic class="italic">Arabis alpina</italic> plants, TFL1 competes with FT1 for binding to FD in a complex with 14-3-3 protein, thereby preventing vernalization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>]. Since in hybrid aspen, 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1/TFL1</italic> expression ceases during dormancy establishment, and remains unaltered during dormancy release by chilling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], additional floral inhibitors must be present. Particularly so, as 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> is upregulated in chilled dormant buds, and the FT1/CENL1 ratio should strongly favor flowering. These inhibitors could include BRC1, which in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> interacts with FT to suppress FT-induced floral transition in AXBs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]. Given the relative closeness of the two species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>], it seems possible that in juvenile hybrid aspen the high level of 
 <italic class="italic">BRC1</italic> expression in AXBs developing under long photoperiod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] and during pre-dormancy chilling under short photoperiod (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>) can be involved in neutralizing 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic>. Remarkably, pre-dormancy chilling not only failed to upregulate 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic>, it also enhanced expression of genes that repress bud burst or floral transition, including 
 <italic class="italic">MAX1, BRC1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic>.
