<p id="Par39" class="p">Pre-dormancy chilling did not advance TB formation in our experiments, contrary to many literature suggestions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. These studies relied predominantly on visual observations. Indeed, TBs can become visible earlier, but we conclude based on bud ontogeny and scale development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>] that TB visibility is not an adequate criterion for the timing of bud initiation. The reason is that low temperature slows down the production of primordia at the apex, possibly exposing older primordia to scale-inducing signals, and belatedly converting them to scales equipped with a rudimentary lamina (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Consequently, fewer leaves below the bud need to unfold, thereby revealing the completed TB earlier. Indeed, an earlier phenological study reported that low temperature does not affect the timing of bud set in the Swedish aspen collection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. Our data are in agreement with this, but show in addition that low temperature in the chilling range negatively affects bud ontogeny and development.
