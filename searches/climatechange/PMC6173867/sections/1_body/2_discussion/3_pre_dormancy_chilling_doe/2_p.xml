<p id="Par40" class="p">That pre-dormancy chilling increased the plastochron, reducing the number of embryonic leaves and bud size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), is disadvantageous because the embryonic shoot is a ‘lifeline through winter’, bridging the gap between seasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Surprisingly, this quality aspect of bud development has not received much attention, although it affects tree performance and survival. A reduced number of embryonic leaves might influence how well the bud can support production of neoformed leaves in the next season. In adult trees, which have many determinate shoots, and which do not produce neoformed leaves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>], the quality of buds is even more important. In addition, it could also negatively affect floral competence, as reproductive meristems are formed in the axils of late pre-formed leaves in the AXBs [
