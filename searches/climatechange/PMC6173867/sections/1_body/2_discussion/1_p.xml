<p id="Par36" class="p">The perennial growth habit of deciduous trees owes its success to a strategy that maximizes the growing period, while leaving sufficient time to prepare for winter. This proactive program implements a sequence of events that culminates in the establishment of dormant acclimated buds. Historically, dormancy is an umbrella concept that covers multiple inactive states, attributed to whole plants, organs, or any meristem-containing structure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Two decades ago, a new paradigm was proposed, identifying dormancy as an intrinsically arrested state, the locus of which is the SAM [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. This anchors the concept of dormancy to the SAM as a self-organizing and autopoietic unit that drives primary morphogenesis, and self-arrests in response to short photoperiod signalling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Escape from self-arrest requires chilling [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. The orderly progression of the dormancy cycle, guided by a sequentially declining photo- and thermoperiod, might be perturbed by the thermal instabilities that accompany global warming. The present experiments demonstrate that pre-dormancy low temperature provides chilling to the buds, because it triggers the dormancy release mechanism, validating the concept of pre-dormancy chilling.
