 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S3). The critical photoperiods of these provenances might have evolved under selection pressure to avoid low temperature exposure during bud development. However, it remains an interesting possibility that, with regard to temperature tolerance and sensitivity in dormancy cycling and vernalization, ecotypic variation might mitigate the effects of warming at high latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>]. There can be standing genetic variation also in the length of the critical photoperiod, providing adaptive potential for northward migration without gene flow, except in the most northern populations [
