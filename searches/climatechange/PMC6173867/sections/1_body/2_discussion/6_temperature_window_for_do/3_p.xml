<p id="Par52" class="p">In brief, locally adapted ecotypes secure proper bud development and dormancy establishment before temperatures decline to chilling levels. Thus, adverse temperature conditions, either too warm or too cold, may compromise dormancy establishment and reduce reproductive success. This is in agreement with early reports on
