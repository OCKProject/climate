<p id="Par50" class="p">The present experiments, carried out in controlled conditions, demonstrate that bud formation and dormancy establishment benefit from moderate temperature conditions (around 18 °C). The decoupling of the photo- and thermoperiod during global warming might also have repercussions for trees in the field. For example, transplanted southern species are at risk of premature exposure to low temperatures, as they will initiate TBs at the critical photoperiod of their origin. In our controlled environment experiments, pre-dormancy chilling reduced bud quality, dormancy establishment and bud fate. High temperatures (24 °C) were equally disruptive, triggering bud flushing in the pre-dormancy phase. Although in nature, such day temperatures do occur during summer, they might be balanced by cooler nights [
