<p id="Par38" class="p">A surprising finding was that 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> was involved in high temperature-induced (24 °C) bud flushing (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S2). As GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> induces bud burst [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], and is required for elongation growth, it is tempting to speculate that a network including FT1 and GA-regulated 1,3-β-glucanases drives high-temperature induced premature bud flushing. Meristem transitions triggered by temperature elevation could be more general, as in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> a moderate increase from 23 °C to 27 °C upregulated 
 <italic class="italic">FT</italic> and induced flowering under short photoperiod [
