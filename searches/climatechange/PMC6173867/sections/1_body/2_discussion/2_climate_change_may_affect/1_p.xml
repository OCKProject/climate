 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>], the effect of temperature on dormancy cycling in perennials has not received the attention it deserves. Although warming is often viewed as positive, potentially lengthening the growing period and yield, it can also have negative effects due to the interaction with other environmental parameters. The present study confirms this scenario. Although high temperature significantly increased growth, in combination with short photoperiod it led to a reduced capacity to establish dormancy. Due to warming, trees will initiate TBs at increasingly higher temperatures at their current locations, potentially compromising dormancy. In a previous study on

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). Although high temperatures compromise the capacity to establish dormancy, flushing can be a sign of adaptive plasticity. For example, it may enable utilization of the full growing season in situations where very early bud burst leads to pre-mature dormancy before the June solstice [
