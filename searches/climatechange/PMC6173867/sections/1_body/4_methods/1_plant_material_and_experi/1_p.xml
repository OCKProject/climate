 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], was grown at a long 18 h photoperiod in a greenhouse at approx. 18 °C and 75% relative humidity (RH). Plants were watered twice a day, and natural light was supplemented to ca. 200 μmol m

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 72 plants) was exposed to short photoperiod for six weeks to induce dormancy. During this treatment TBs and developing AXBs (para-dormant) become dormant. Subsequently, plants were exposed for six weeks to traditional chilling at 5 °C to release dormancy (eco-dormant). The other group of plants (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 80) were subdivided into four equal groups, transferred to controlled climate cabinets, and acclimated for three days in long photoperiod. Subsequently, four different day/night temperature regimes were used: ‘high’ (D/N 24/24 °C), ‘moderate’ (D/N 18/18 °C), ‘moderate-low’ (D/N 18/12 °C), and ‘low’ (D/N 12/12 °C). At the start of the distinct temperature regimes, the daylength was reduced to 10 h in all cabinets. Although temperatures between 5 and 7 °C are optimal for chilling induced dormancy release in many species, we chose 12 °C for low-temperature exposure because it is the upper temperature threshold for chilling while still permitting growth [
