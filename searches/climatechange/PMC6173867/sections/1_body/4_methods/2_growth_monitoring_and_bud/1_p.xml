<p id="Par55" class="p">We monitored plant growth by measuring overall shoot elongation as well as the number of new internodes that were produced at week four and six. After four weeks, we analysed bud structure in five plants per treatment. TBs and multiple AXBs were collected, fixed in 70% alcohol, and stored at 4 °C. Buds were examined, photographed and their sizes measured, using a preparation microscope. Each bud was opened with a surgical scalpel and the number of bud scales, embryonic leaves, and leaf primordia were counted. The presence or absence of a rudimentary lamina at the bud scales was recorded.</p>
