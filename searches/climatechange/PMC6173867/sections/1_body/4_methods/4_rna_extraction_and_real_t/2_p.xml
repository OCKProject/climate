<p id="Par58" class="p">We analysed TBs and young AXBs (positions 1–10), which are still sinks that are susceptible to short photoperiod signalling from the leaves, and can establish dormancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. For each data point, RNA was extracted from six plants, divided into two biological replicates. In all cases, sampling was carried out during the last hour of the short photoperiod. In addition, leaf tissue around major veins was collected from each group. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at − 80 °C for later RNA extraction and qPCR analysis.
