<p id="Par56" class="p">We tested the effect of the different treatment regimens on dormancy establishment after six weeks by transferring TBs and bud-internode units to mild forcing conditions (16 h light, PPFD 170 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">− 2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>, 18 °C, 70% RH). Stems were cut into internodes, with the AXB at the higher end of approx. 2 cm long segments. The stem bases were inserted through tiny holes in a supporting Styrofoam sheet, and floated on water or 100 μM solutions of GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> or GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, with the lower stem end submerged. Bud burst was scored as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. AXBs were grouped into three subsequent categories, reflecting developmental-, mature- and potentially senescent-stages: ‘young AXB’ (positions 1–10 from the top), ‘maturing AXB’ (positions 11–20 from the top) and ‘old AXB’ (positions 21–30 from the top).
