<p id="Par30" class="p">The finding that pre-dormancy low temperature hampered bud ontogeny and dormancy establishment suggests that it might also affect gene expression related to vernalization, even though these young poplars are not yet competent to flower. Notably, some of these genes, including 
 <italic class="italic">CO</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">FT</italic>, play a role in both dormancy cycling and floral transition. To assess this, we analysed the expression of these three key floral pathway genes. The present data show that pre-dormancy low temperature significantly reduced 
 <italic class="italic">CO</italic> expression in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>). Continuous low temperature prevented the downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>), although during short-photoperiod induced dormancy establishment it is typically downregulated in TBs and AXBs. 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> expression was virtually absent from dormant TB and AXBs, but it was hyperinduced after six weeks of chilling (5 °C), whereas the pre-dormancy low temperature upregulated it relatively little (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a, c</xref>).
