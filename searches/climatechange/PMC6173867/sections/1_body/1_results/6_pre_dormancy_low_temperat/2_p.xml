<p id="Par31" class="p">We hypothesized that other floral pathway genes downstream of 
 <italic class="italic">CO</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">FT</italic> could also be differently affected by pre-dormancy low temperature. Therefore, we investigated three key floral pathway genes that are related to vernalization, including putative poplar homologs of the 
 <italic class="italic">SOC1</italic>-clade gene 
 <italic class="italic">AGAMOUS-LIKE 14</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">APETALA1</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">AP1</italic>), and 
 <italic class="italic">LEAFY</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic>). Expression of 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> was lowest in dormant buds, but increased within three weeks in both TBs and AXBs after chilling at 5 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). In contrast, pre-dormancy low temperatures reduced 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> expression in comparable AXBs to about half in the same period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">AP1</italic> expression during chilling of dormant buds was reduced, particularly in the TBs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). During pre-dormancy, low temperature also significantly reduced 
 <italic class="italic">AP1</italic> expression in AXBs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>).
