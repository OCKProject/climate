<p id="Par33" class="p">Contrary to buds, 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> transcripts in leaves were not at a measurable level regardless of the temperature regime. Surprisingly, the embryonic leaves that emerged from the buds after TB flushing at 24/24 °C expressed 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> at steady, albeit relatively low levels (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S2). Considering that xylem-fed GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, but not GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, induces bud flush even when buds are dormant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>], we investigated if these hormones could potentially mediate high temperature-induced bud flushing. This showed that GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, but not GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, promoted 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> expression in para-dormant buds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref>). In contrast, while GA
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> promoted 
 <italic class="italic">CENL1</italic> expression in all bud types and states, GA
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> did not promote it in para-dormant buds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8b</xref>).
