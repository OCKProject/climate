<p id="Par32" class="p">Considering that 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> induces 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic>, it was not unexpected that the pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic> expression was similar to that of 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> in chilled dormant buds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). Levels of 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic> transcripts were highest at week six, at which point dormancy is released, in both TBs and AXBs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). In stark contrast, pre-dormancy low temperature significantly reduced 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic> expression, relative to the expression in chilled dormant buds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>). In conclusion, the upregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">FT1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">AGL14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LFY</italic> by low temperature occurs only in dormant buds.
