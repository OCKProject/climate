<p id="Par34" class="p">The bud burst test showed that not all buds were able to burst after pre-dormancy low temperature treatment. Gene expression analyses showed that the genes that are involved in bud suppression were upregulated, possibly contributing to diminished bud break. Suppression of AXB burst in hybrid aspen involves

 <italic class="italic">MAX1</italic>), a strigolactone biosynthesis gene, and 
 <italic class="italic">BRANCHED1 (BRC1)</italic>, encoding a transcription factor that functions downstream of MAX1. As shown here, six weeks of chilling and pre-dormancy low temperature upregulated

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b, d</xref>). In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">BRC1</italic> expression was reduced after six weeks in chilled dormant buds, whereas pre-dormancy low temperature upregulated the gene (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b, d</xref>). In conclusion, the expression of these branch-inhibitor genes could counteract the dormancy-releasing effect of pre-dormancy low temperature, thereby preventing flushing.
