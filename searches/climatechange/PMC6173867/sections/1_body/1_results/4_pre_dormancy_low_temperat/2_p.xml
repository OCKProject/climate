<p id="Par23" class="p">At the moderate reference temperature (18/18 °C), it took four weeks to produce TBs, and after five weeks 100% of TBs and almost all AXBs (AXB positions 1–10) established dormancy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Most AXBs at lower positions (11–30) had completed their development and were para-dormant prior to the transfer to short photoperiod. We found that low temperature during bud development significantly reduced dormancy establishment in both TB and AXBs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The young AXBs were more resistant to the dormancy-releasing effect of low temperature than the TBs, reflecting that TBs were activated earlier than young AXBs. When only the night temperature was low, about 20% of TBs failed to establish dormancy, while this increased to approx. 60% when the temperature was continuously low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
