<p id="Par24" class="p">In young AXBs (positions 1–10), 12 °C at night-time alone hardly affected dormancy, but at continuous low temperature bud burst increased to 35% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Older AXBs were highly responsive to 12 °C, and about 40% (11–20) and 75% (21–30) burst after night-time low temperature, and about 85% and 100% after continuous low temperature exposure, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The results clearly show that in combination with short photoperiod even mild chilling dampens dormancy establishment, demonstrating that in this species low temperature (12 °C) does not contribute to dormancy, but instead antagonizes it.
