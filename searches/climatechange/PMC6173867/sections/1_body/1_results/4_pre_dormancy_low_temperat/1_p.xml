<p id="Par22" class="p">As low temperature adversely affected bud ontogeny and structure, we next investigated if it also affected their capacity to establish dormancy. We applied low temperature only at night (18/12 °C), or continuously (12/12 °C). Although less effective than 5 °C, we chose 12 °C because it is permissive of growth and development, while still being in the 5-12 °C range for chilling and vernalization.</p>
