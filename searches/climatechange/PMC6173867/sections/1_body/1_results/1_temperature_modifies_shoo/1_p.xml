<p id="Par14" class="p">Shoot elongation under long photoperiod involves a number of apical internodes that elongate simultaneously, albeit at different rates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Subsequent exposure to short photoperiod halts the production of new internodes, and eventually shoot elongation. To investigate if and how temperature influences this process, we monitored the response of two categories of internodes: (1) internodes elongating already under long photoperiod, and (2) internodes that were still in their incipient phase, including those that arose during the treatment.
