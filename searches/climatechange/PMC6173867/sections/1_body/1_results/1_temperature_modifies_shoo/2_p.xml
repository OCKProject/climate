<p id="Par15" class="p">Internodes of the first category (long photoperiod, 18 h; 18/18 °C) slightly reduced elongation under subsequent short photoperiod relative to those that remained under long photoperiod (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Although the reduction was not statistically significant, it could reflect the shortening of the period plants could photosynthesize. A statistically significant reduction of approx. 17% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) was measured after lowering the night-temperature (18/12 °C), reflecting reduced night-time phloem transport from source leaves to internode sinks. Lowering also the day-temperature reduced elongation further to 24% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), possibly by diminishing photosynthesis. In brief, short photoperiod reduced elongation of stretching internodes quantitatively, in a temperature-dependent manner.
