<p id="Par17" class="p">The 24/24 °C temperature regime induced unique effects. In contrast to the other temperature treatments, internode stretching was the same in the two different internode categories. Notably, the incipient internodes lacked the enhanced responsiveness to short photoperiod, measured in the other temperature regimes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In addition, the internodes that were already elongating remained significantly shorter at this high temperature, relative to similar internodes at moderate temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Under high temperature the production and elongation of new internodes was prioritized, as the plastochron dramatically decreased, tripling the number of elongating internodes and leaves at week 4 (Fig.
