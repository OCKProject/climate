<p id="Par16" class="p">The incipient and newly formed internodes showed a similar but much stronger trend. At constant standard temperature (18/18 °C), elongation of the top three internodes diminished by approx. 40% relative to the internodes below it (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). When only the night-temperature was lower (18/12 °C) the reduction exceeded 70% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Lowering also the day-temperature (12/12 °C) reduced elongation slightly further (78%, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In brief, short photoperiod alone affected mostly the incipient and new internodes. Low temperature during the night amplified this effect, whereas continuing low temperature through the day hardly reduced elongation further, reflecting reduced photosynthesis and night-time transport of photosynthates to incipient internodes. Low temperature also significantly increased the plastochron. During night-time it slightly reduced internode production, while continuous low temperature halved it (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Similarly, overall gain in height was halved by continuous low temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>).
