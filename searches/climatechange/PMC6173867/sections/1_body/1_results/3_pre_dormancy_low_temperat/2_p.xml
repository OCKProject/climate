<p id="Par21" class="p">As a result, TBs that formed at low temperature (either 18/12 °C or 12/12 °C), as well as AXBs that continued development at this temperature, were much smaller than those produced at moderate temperature (18/18 °C). TBs were clearly longer and broader at 18/18 °C than at the other temperature regimes. To a lesser degree, this was also true for AXBs (Fig.
