<p id="Par20" class="p">At low temperature (12/12 °C) the plastochron was lengthened (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), resulting in a general slow-down of primordium initiation at the apex, and a reduction of the number of primordia that gave rise to embryonic leaves inside the emerging bud. TBs that developed under standard conditions (18/18 °C) possessed 10 embryonic leaves on average, while TBs that were exposed to the mildly low temperature typically possessed 7 embryonic leaves. Interestingly, it did not make a difference if low temperature was applied continuously (12/12 °C) or only during the night (18/12 °C), suggesting that also here night-time import via the phloem is a limiting factor. Young AXBs, below the apex, responded in a similar fashion, as the number of embryonic leaves was reduced from 10 to 8 at both temperature regimes.
