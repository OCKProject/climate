<p id="Par26" class="p">To assess why short photoperiod failed to induce dormancy under low temperature in a large portion of TB (60%) and young AXBs (35%) (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. We hypothesized that the antagonizing effect of low temperature was due to a prematurely triggered, mistimed chilling response that engages part of the molecular machinery that releases dormancy. To test this, we investigated gene expression in young developing AXBs, which were exposed to short photoperiod at different temperatures. We analysed the expression of genes involved in the production of biologically active GAs and GA signalling, as well as GA deactivation. In addition, we analysed the expression of four 1,3-β-glucanase genes (GH17), encoding representative members of the GA
