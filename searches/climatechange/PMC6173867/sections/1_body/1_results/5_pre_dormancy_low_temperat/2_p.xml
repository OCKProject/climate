 <italic class="italic">GA20ox8</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GA3ox1</italic>, key members of the GA20ox and GA3ox families, which are involved in the two final steps in the production of bioactive GAs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>], were considerably upregulated in AXBs that developed under low temperature (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">GID1</italic>, which encodes a GA-receptor, was upregulated by low temperature in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">GA2ox1</italic>, encoding a GA-deactivating enzyme, was also upregulated by low temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>).
