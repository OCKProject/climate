<p id="Par18" class="p">We next investigated if low temperature advances short photoperiod-induced TB initiation, as proposed in the literature. The first morphologically visible sign of bud formation is the metamorphosis of leaf primordia into scales. During leaf development, a primordium produces a lamina as well as stipules, thread-like appendages that decorate the leaf-base. Under short photoperiod, the apex reverses its developmental priorities, blocking lamina and leaf development while enlarging and hardening the stipules into bud scales. Because the last emerging long photoperiod leaves wrap the apex, visually concealing scale formation, we used a validated method to reconstruct the timing of scale initiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. For each of the selected photoperiod-temperature regimes, we counted the number of internode-leaf units that emerged up to the point where the SAM had initiated scale production. This internode-leaf unit count is analogous to the method used to determine flowering time in
