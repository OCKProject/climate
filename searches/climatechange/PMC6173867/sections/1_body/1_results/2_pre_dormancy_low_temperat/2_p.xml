<p id="Par19" class="p">This showed that relative to 18/18 °C, the plastochron was shortened at 24/24 °C and lengthened at 12/12 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). At constant 12 °C, the overall production of primordia slowed down substantially. Consequently, the first scales arose from developmentally older primordia that had formed under long photoperiod (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1). If left at 18/18 °C, these primordia would have developed into leaves. Indeed, these developmentally older scales often had a rudimentary lamina (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>). Under moderate temperature (18/18 °C), such lamina between the scales was not observed. In brief, low temperature affected TB composition by producing bud scales from older leaf primordia (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1).
