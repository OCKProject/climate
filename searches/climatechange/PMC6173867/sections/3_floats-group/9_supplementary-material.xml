    <bold class="bold">Table S1.</bold> Bud scale-initiation date calculated from the internode-leaf units that emerged before the TB was formed. Days were deduced from the plastochron. 
    <bold class="bold">Figure S1.</bold> Expression of gibberellin receptor, 
    <italic class="italic">GID1A</italic> and 
    <italic class="italic">GID1B</italic> during dormancy establishment under short photoperiod and subsequent dormancy removal by chilling. Expression is presented as fold changes using long day value as reference (=1). Plants were first kept for 8 weeks under short photoperiod (SD0-SD8) and subsequently chilled for 8 weeks (CH0-CH8) to remove dormancy. The end of short photoperiod treatment (SD8) is comparable to the beginning of chilling treatment (CH0). The approximate timing of dormancy establishment and dormancy removal in the given conditions are indicated by arrows. (values are means ± SE, 
    <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6). 
    <bold class="bold">Figure S2.</bold> Expression of 
    <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> and 
    <italic class="italic">FT2</italic> in leaves under short photoperiod and at different temperature regimes. Plants were exposed to either high (24/24 °C), moderate (18/18 °C), moderate/low (18/12 °C) and low (12/12 °C) temperature conditions for six weeks. Expression was analysed in source leaves at all temperature combinations, and in the new leaves that unfolded after flushing at high ambient temperature (24/24 °C). Highest Ct values for 
    <italic class="italic">FT1</italic> and 
    <italic class="italic">FT2</italic> indicated. (values are means ± SE, 
    <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6). 
    <bold class="bold">Figure S3.</bold> Photo- and thermo-periods of four European aspen ecotypes at their native locations. (A-D) Scatter plots (black line) indicate the length of the daily photoperiod, from 1 May to 31 September. The mean monthly temperatures are presented in the table below the plot, including absolute maximum and minimum of the given month, exemplified for the year 2010. The longest day, 21 June, is indicated by a green dot. The timing of bud burst varies at different latitudes, but at summer solstice the trees are actively growing at all locations. The first red dot indicates the date at which the days are clearly shorter (&lt;) than the critical photoperiod of a given ecotype (data from [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]). Subsequent red dots indicate photoperiods that are shorter than the indicated number of hours. Once the short photoperiod is perceived, the formation of complete buds takes approx. 4 weeks [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Approximate timing of bud formation is indicated by red arrow. A blue dot indicates the approximate onset of low temperatures, although sporadically temperatures can drop also during the warm season. (E) Coordinates of the four latitudes (provenances).
