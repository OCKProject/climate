  <p class="p">The effect of temperature on bud dormancy establishment. Dormancy in terminal buds (TB), in young developing axillary buds (AXB) at position 1–10 (counted from the top; black bar) and mature AXBs at positions 11–20 (light blue bar) and 21–30 (dark blue bar). Bud burst was monitored using single internode cuttings under long photoperiod and constant 18 °C. ND, no data collected due to default branching. Buds that did not burst under these conditions were considered dormant. (
