Water with or without GAs (100 μM) was xylem-fed into the buds for three days, at which time-point bursting was not yet visibly initiated. The bars show fold changes relative to the water control of each dormancy stage (set at 1). The numbers on the bars show differences in expression levels between the different stages. (values are means ± SE,
