  <title class="title">Interaction between politcal view and education level as predictors of perceptions of climate change across the Canadian forest sector.</title>
  <p class="p">Conditional Inference (CI) classification trees split the dataset into different groups based on certain values of the explanatory variables. At each intermediate mode, dataset is split into two groups based on the values of the explanatory variable indicated in the branches under the node. For statement 1.1, the first node splits the sample into conservatives (political view &gt;4, in a scale from 1 to 7) and liberals, and succesive nodes further split the liberal group into more radical liberals (â‰¤ 3) and moderate liberals (&gt;3). This group is finally split as a function of their educational degree. Those respondents without a Bachelor in Sciences (BSc) are more unsure about the anthropic origin of climate change than those holding a BSc or higher degree. Stacked bar plot at each terminal node indicates the proportion of respondents that disagreed (dark gray), agreed (light gray) or were unsure (gray) about the statement. Total sample size depends on the statement, and can be calculated adding the sample size of the terminal nodes (indicated by brackets). Each tree only shows statistically significant variables at p &lt; 0.05. The classification accuracy for each conditional inference tree is also provided. The CI trees for the all the statements included in the survey can be found at
