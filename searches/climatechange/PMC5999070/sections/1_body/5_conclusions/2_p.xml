<p class="p">Both the institutional environment (type of stakeholder) and geographical origin (province) were found to be important predictors beyond the individual ideology. Westernmost provinces proved to be more worried about the current impacts of climate change, whereas the industry sector was the most skeptical about the anthropogenic origin of climate change and the need for new management practices. We suggest that the design of a strategic framework for implementing climate adaptation within the Canadian forest sector must take into account these specificities, focusing on the relationship between climate change and changes in disturbance regimes, and above all on the economic consequences of these changes. Considering the willingness to adapt is high throughout the sector, identifying the main barriers that prevent implementing on-the-ground adaptations to management practices across stakeholders is critical, and should be the aim of future research in this field.</p>
