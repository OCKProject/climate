<p class="p">Forest ecosystems, as well as the forest sector in Canada, are highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to the magnitude of the projected increases in temperature at northern latitudes, the long temporal horizon of forest planning, and the social and economic importance of forests [

After years in which climate policy has focused primarily on mitigation, it is now clear that the efforts devoted to reducing global greenhouse emissions have fallen short in preventing climate from continuing to change at such a rapid pace [
