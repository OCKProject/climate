<p class="p">This research was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee on Research with Human Beings (CIEREH) of the University of Québec à Montreal (Approval Code: S-703000). Written informed consent, was obtained from the participants. During the spring of 2015, data was collected from individuals with a professional interest in the management of Canadian forests. To capture potential differences in opinion across Canada, we contacted individuals from the five provinces where the forest sector has the most economic value, comprising more than 90% of workers in the Canadian forest sector: Québec, British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta, and New Brunswick [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. We searched online employee directories of federal and provincial agencies with jurisdiction of forest management or forest-related research in each province (i.e., Canadian Forest Service, Provincial Ministries of Forests, etc.) as well as those of academic institutions and research centers related to forest ecology or forest management. We selected all the employees whose job titles suggested that their duties were related to the forest sector, resulting in a database of 3,244 potential participants who were then contacted directly through email. To reach individuals in private companies we contacted each provincial Association of Professional Foresters, as well as the Canadian Forestry Adaptation Community of Practice (FACoP), who distributed the survey among their members or associates. We additionally distributed the survey among students of the same academic faculties identified above, to incorporate opinions of future forest leaders who will inherit climate challenges in the forest sector, and to evaluate if their opinions differed from the other stakeholder groups.
