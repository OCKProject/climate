 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Random forests have the advantage of handling large numbers of predictor variables, and are able to provide robust ranking of variable importance even among highly correlated predictors [

Random forests have shown high performance for both classification and regression problems, and have thus been used successfully in many fields, including the analysis of the main variables that determine the responses to surveys on climate change [
