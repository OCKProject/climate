<p class="p">At first sight, our results suggest that investing in education may seem an effective tool to increase awareness of climate change. However, McCright and Dunlap [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] reported that the level of education in the United States is correlated with greater climate change risk perceptions only among liberals, but with a lower risk perception for conservatives, suggesting that higher education ultimately strengthens ideological views. This change in the sense of the interaction between education level and political view has not been observed for European forest owners [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], and we could not detect it in our dataset either, but attention should be paid to this possibility when designing awareness-raising campaigns.
