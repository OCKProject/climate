<p class="p">The high overall awareness about climate change and its causes and impacts observed in this study could indicate that campaigns targeting the forest sector in general are no longer needed. In addition, and considering the lack of changes in the acceptance of climate change over the last 10 years, we can conclude that recent awareness campaigns are not succeeding, and they should be redesigned if they intend to reach those few pockets that still remain skeptical.

There was also a significant increase in the perception of climate change as a risk for forests. These results are encouraging from a policy point of view since the inability to predict impacts with sufficient detail and certainty (i.e. uncertainty aversion) has been commonly identified as one of the main barriers to implementation of adaptive practices [
