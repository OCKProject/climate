<p class="p">When comparing these findings with those of a survey conducted a decade earlier among forestry experts [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], there was no significant change in the perceptions about climate change and its impacts in general (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197689.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, there were significant decreases in the proportion of respondents claiming that they did not understand the impacts of climate change (mean ± SD 3.2 ± 1.6
