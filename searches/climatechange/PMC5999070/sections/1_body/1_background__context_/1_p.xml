<p class="p">In recent years, the volume of studies examining the variables that are related to the acceptance of anthropogenic climate change has grown unprecedentedly [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Socio-demographic variables such as gender, age, education, or income have all been identified as significant predictors of climate change awareness and risk perception, although recent studies suggest that the importance of these variables pales in comparison to other individual-level predictors such as ideology or political orientation [

 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In addition to these factors, the institutional and geographical environment play an important role, although they have been studied much less [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The personal opinion of respondents is likely to be affected by their institutional environment (i.e. type of stakeholder: federal government, industry, academia, etc.), which can amplify or attenuate their judgement [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Moreover, there can be significant variation in responses depending on the province in which respondents work and, consequently, their exposure to changes in climate, impacts, legislation, and forest practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. For instance, the direct exposure to changes in climate and extreme weather conditions a respondent experiences–which will be highly variable across geographical areas–is known to influence their perceptions on climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0197689.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In order to analyse the real effect of the institutional and geographical environment on the perceptions of stakeholders, it is thus necessary to take into account the multiple factors hypothesized to affect climate change perceptions at the individual scale, as well as the potential interactions among these factors [
