    <p class="p">As temperature rises, the adaptive response of using air conditioning increases electricity demand and subsequent emissions of harmful pollutants from electric power plants.</p>

   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">Independent of emissions from the electric power sector, climate change is known to worsen air quality through changes in atmospheric chemistry and natural biogenic emissions.</p>

   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">We examine the effects of climate change on air quality and human health through the combined impacts of increased emissions from power plants due to altered air conditioning demand and from direct effects on atmospheric chemistry.</p>

    <p class="p">We used computer models to calculate the air pollution and health impacts of a warmer climate with and without greater use of air conditioning and subsequent increases in harmful emissions from power plants.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">We found that concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM
     <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) and ozone (O
     <sub class="sub">3</sub>) increase in a warmer climate and that 3.8% of the total increase in PM
     <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and 6.7% of the total increase in ozone (O
     <sub class="sub">3</sub>) are attributable to extra air conditioning use.

   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">We calculated that climate change alone increases summer air-pollution-related premature mortality by about 13,000 deaths due to PM
     <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and 3,000 deaths due to O
     <sub class="sub">3</sub> (consistent with other studies).

    <p class="p">Increased air conditioning, specifically, accounts for 654 future summer PM
     <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>-related deaths (approximately $6 billion cost—based on a value of statistical life calculated from 26 studies—and a 4.8% increase above climate change impacts alone) and 315 O
     <sub class="sub">3</sub>-related deaths (approximately $3 billion cost and an 8.7% increase above climate change impacts alone).

  <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">This is the first study to our knowledge to examine future air-pollution-related health damages of power plant emissions driven by increased electricity demand for air conditioning, a primary adaptation to warmer temperatures.</p>

   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">Quantifying the extent to which air conditioning adaptation exacerbates climate-change-related air quality can improve decision-making, especially in both the health and electric power sectors.</p>

   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">This analysis highlights the need for cleaner energy sources, energy efficiency, and energy conservation to meet our growing dependence on buildings’ cooling systems, while simultaneously mitigating the extent of climate change.</p>
