<p class="p">We chose to run simulations through CMAQ for only July as these simulations were the most computationally expensive part of our linked model system. As results represent estimates based on only a single year of climate simulations, findings are meant as exploratory and illustrative, and as such the marginal limitation of extrapolating July results as representative of summer (and summer as representative of annual impacts) is small. Future research could utilize less computationally expensive methods to run more scenarios over longer and more representative timescales, but the complex mechanisms included in CMAQ are necessary to explore the impacts of power sector emissions on air quality in a changing climate through the new relationship described here. We also chose July based on 3 additional simulations that were run (baseline, baseline with fires, mid-century baseline) and 2 others that were prepared but not run (present and future emissions approximated through temperature versus emissions relationships defined as in Abel et al. [
