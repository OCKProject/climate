CMAQ was run with 25 vertical layers, a 12 km by 12 km horizontal resolution over the eastern US, and boundary conditions taken from a month-averaged run of present-day conditions with NEI emissions estimates over the continental US, which in turn used boundary conditions from the Model for Ozone and Related Chemical Tracers, version 4 [
