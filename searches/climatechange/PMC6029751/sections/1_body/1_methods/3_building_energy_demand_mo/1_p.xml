<p class="p">Present-day and warm mid-century meteorology were input to the RBESS, a modeling process developed following Schuetter et al. [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] and used here to determine the response of building energy demand to meteorology. This process merges industry-standard building energy modeling techniques using the DOE-2 software (developed by James J. Hirsch &amp; Associates and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) and regional building stock data with the meteorology discussed above following Meier et al. [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], which describes the methodology used here in detail. Building stock data were provided by the US EIA through the Commercial Buildings Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS), the Manufacturing Energy Consumption Survey (MECS), and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS). The building stock was held static under both the present-day and warm-climate scenarios. The simulation was calibrated using historical 2007 electricity data from a US EPA compilation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) data. Use of the present-day building stock was not meant to be predictive but was chosen to bound the potential damages of climate inaction.
