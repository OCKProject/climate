 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. NARCCAP is a suite of climate data from several Global Climate Modelâ€“Regional Climate Model pairs built on the A2 emissions scenario of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a trajectory that most closely mirrors current global greenhouse gas emissions trends [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This emissions scenario assumes that little or no action is taken to mitigate climate change, which makes it appropriate for the goals of this study, to isolate the potential impact of increased power sector emissions on air quality. Thus, any successful future action to mitigate climate change would alleviate some of the damages calculated here.
