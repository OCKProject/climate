<p class="p">Due to the computationally demanding simulations of this study, it is not feasible to consider a 30-year subset of mid-century years, as is recommended for climate impact studies. Rather, July of a single year from a single model in NARCCAP was selected to represent a warm, realistic mid-century summer, as discussed in detail in Harkey and Holloway [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. We selected the year 2069 from CCSM version 3 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], downscaled with the WRF model in NARCCAP, and further downscaled with WRF for this study to our 12 km by 12 km study domain. This year was chosen as the warmest year from the mean model in the suite, as shown in

 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. To isolate the impact of climate change on air quality, we used the same 2011 emissions data and lateral boundary conditions for all simulations. Climate processes are considered to affect biogenic emissions, power plant emissions, and the transport of point-source anthropogenic emissions.
