<p class="p">Therefore, findings are separated into the impacts of meteorology representative of 2 summer climate scenarios, the present-day climate and a warm mid-century climate representative of climate change mitigation inaction (July 2011 and July 2069). Meteorological conditions for July in the warm mid-century climate used in the MCCO and MCA scenarios are on average approximately 3.5 °C (29.1 °C versus 25.6 °C, 13.7%) warmer in the eastern US region than in the present-day.</p>
