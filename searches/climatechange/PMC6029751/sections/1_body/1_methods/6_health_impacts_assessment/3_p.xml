<p class="p">Impact estimates are based on exacerbated pollution in July alone. Annual impacts are calculated as a 3-month summer average based on July modeling. Thus, we take July as representative of the entire summer and triple our calculated results to arrive at a summer estimate. This is a reasonable assumption for the changes in air pollution and health impacts analyzed here, especially given the focus on the incremental impact of adaptation. Values presented in tables are for July exposure alone and have not been tripled. Average baseline scenario concentrations of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> from July modeling are applied outside of July in all calculations to isolate changes. Summer results are a good estimate for annual impacts although they are likely conservative as we would also expect spring and fall to exhibit some increased air pollution and adverse health outcomes. Winter air quality conditions are less influenced by the electricity sector. Impacts for estimated annual/summer exposure are provided in the text while July exposure impacts are presented in the tables.
