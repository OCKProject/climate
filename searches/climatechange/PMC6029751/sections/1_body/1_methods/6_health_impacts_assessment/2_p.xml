 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]), and an effect estimate from the chosen C-R function with specified changes in gridded air quality data to quantify health impacts. Each exposure–response function and pooling of incidence and valuation was run in a 5,000-member Monte Carlo ensemble to calculate mean impacts and associated uncertainty. Pooling methods are used to combine results for similar health endpoints across C-R functions as an alternative to meta-analysis. The techniques used here follow standard EPA methods including user-assigned weighting, random effects, fixed effects, addition, and subtraction to combine results of studies as described in Appendix K of [

Valuation to monetize the costs of exacerbated air pollution is performed according to standard EPA configurations by assigning a value to each health effect through a combination of willingness to pay and cost of illness (e.g., value of a statistical life) methods, then applying that to calculated incidences [
