The daily mean is used directly for many morbidity functions. All impacts calculated by BenMAP at any timescale are summed and reported annually by the model as standard practice. Therefore, values provided in the tables are annual impacts based on July exposure, while values provided in the text are annual impacts based on estimated annual exposure calculated as a 3-month summer average based on July modeling, as discussed above.

Justification for modeling only July is discussed in detail above but centers on balancing computational demands with the exploratory and representative (rather than predictive) nature of this study. We present in the main text primarily the results for mortality, which by standard methods are not pooled. Please see
