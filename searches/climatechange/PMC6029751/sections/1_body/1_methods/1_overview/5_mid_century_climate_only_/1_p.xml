<p class="p">This scenario represents warm mid-century conditions for climate, selected as described in detail below. Building energy demand and power sector (EGU) emissions remain constant as simulated for present-day conditions. This scenario represents the impact of climate change alone on air quality and health. There is no change in building activity or associated anthropogenic emissions from electricity demand.</p>
