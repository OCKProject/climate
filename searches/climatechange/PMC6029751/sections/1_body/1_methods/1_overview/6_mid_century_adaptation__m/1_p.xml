<p class="p">This scenario represents warm mid-century conditions for climate. Building energy demand and power sector emissions are simulated using mid-century representative meteorology with inventory and performance held constant (modern natural gas power plants are assumed to provide the additional capacity needed to meet increased electricity demand). This scenario represents the impact of climate change and increased EGU emissions due to greater building air conditioning demand in response to warmer temperatures.</p>
