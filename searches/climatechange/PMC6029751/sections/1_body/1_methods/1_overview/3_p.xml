<p class="p">Three scenarios are simulated: the present-day climate, a mid-century climate with present-day emissions, and a mid-century climate with emissions from adaptation. Each of these scenarios utilizes meteorology from the WRF model for present-day and NARCCAP CCSM version 3 for mid-century. The RBESS is used to assess building energy demand, and MyPower is used to simulate electricity dispatch (production) and associated power sector emissions. CMAQ is used to simulate air quality, and BenMAP assesses the health outcomes from air quality changes.</p>
