Data for power plant characteristics including heat rates and emissions rates were derived from NEEDS, a part of the US EPA’s Power Sector Modeling Platform, and modified to reflect data reported in the US EPA’s Clean Air Markets Database through 2013. Present-day conditions reflect electricity sector characteristics through 2011. Warm-climate conditions reflect planned changes to the electricity grid. Existing renewable energy portfolio standards are met through a combination of technologies reported in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables &amp; Efficiency (DSIRE) database [

In the warm-climate scenarios, power plants are assumed to maintain “resource adequacy” such that generating capacity exceeds the highest single hour of demand by 15%. The additional required power is supplied through new construction of natural gas power plants (70% combined-cycle, 30% single-cycle) with characteristics based on the Annual Energy Outlook from the US EIA [
