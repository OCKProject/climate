<p class="p">For comparison of these building-related impacts with the health impacts associated with climate change alone (MCCOâ€“PD), we calculated premature mortality from all causes and MDA8 O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> exposure as 3,234 deaths (range of 2,001 to 4,527) based on three studies and non-accidental mortality from MDA8 O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> exposure as 1,692 deaths (range of 888 to 4,194) based on 5 studies. Using maximum daily 1-hour concentrations, we find 4,431 all-cause deaths (range of 2,994 to 5,895) and 2,241 non-accidental deaths (range of 1,671 to 3,111). For MCA-PD, we calculated 3,514 deaths on average (range of 2,175 to 4,920), with a cost of $32.5 billion. The average 95% CI across studies is 2,028 to 5,026 deaths. Using MDA8 O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and considering premature mortality from all causes, we find that 8.0% of additional deaths in the MCA scenario are from adaptation and 92.0% are from climate alone, i.e., adaptation yields an 8.7% increase above climate change impacts alone.
