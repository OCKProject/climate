<p class="p">For O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, the results are similar to the findings for PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, but additional functions address mortality from specific causes. The health impacts of projected mid-century building energy use on O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (MCA–MCCO) include an average of 315 deaths ($3 billion) based on 3 standard configuration studies with a range of 198 to 438; ($2 billion to $4 billion). The average 95% CI across studies is 184 to 447 deaths. Using maximum daily 1-hour O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations to assess this same scenario (MCA–MCCO), one study calculates mortality from all causes, finding 369 additional deaths. Analyzing the studies with common health endpoints, we find that using maximum daily 1-hour O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> rather than MDA8 O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations results in higher mortality from all causes (369 versus 315 deaths annually) and more non-accidental deaths (189 versus 162 deaths annually).
