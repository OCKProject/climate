 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exhibit a range of mean increases in mortality from 87 to 1,245 deaths ($0 to $12 billion in costs) annually and an average of 654 deaths ($6 billion); see 
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for individual study confidence intervals. The average 95% CI across studies is 131 to 1,251 deaths. Adapting to climate change as calculated here accounts for a 4.8% increase over the impacts from climate change alone (MCCO–PD), which on average causes 12,906 additional premature deaths (mean estimate range across studies: 1,254 to 25,227) with mean costs of $120 billion (mean estimate range across studies: $12 billion to $234 billion). The average 95% CI across studies is 2,558 to 24,978 deaths. The total impact of climate and adaptation (MCA–PD) causes a mean of 13,547 premature deaths (mean estimate range across studies: 1,320 to 26,481) based on the average of all functions (roughly the sum of climate alone and adaptation alone), with mean costs of $126 billion (mean estimate range across studies: $12 billion to $246 billion). The average 95% CI across studies is 2,685 to 26,213 deaths.
