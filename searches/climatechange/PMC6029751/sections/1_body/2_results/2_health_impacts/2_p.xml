<p class="p">As discussed in the Methods, we present annual impacts (estimated as a 3-month summer average based on July modeling) in the text, while results in tables are annual impacts based on changes to July exposure only. We include 14 C-R functions for PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>-related adult mortality, with each function reported separately. The change in mortality incidence and the economic valuation of this loss of life are shown in
