<p class="p">The independent health impact estimates from exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> cannot be directly summed because BenMAP does not account for interaction effects between the 2 pollutants, and exposures often occur in the same location at the same time. The spatial distributions of mortality are shown by county in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> for PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (maximum daily 1-hour and MDA8). The spatial distribution of impacts follows the patterns seen for air pollution in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>. Regions near the Ohio River Valley and urban areas see the greatest mortality damages. In South Carolina, the Chesapeake Bay, and small portions of Maine and Texas, there is a slight decrease in mortality associated with a small, localized decrease in modeled emissions associated with modeled building energy demand and electricity dispatch.
