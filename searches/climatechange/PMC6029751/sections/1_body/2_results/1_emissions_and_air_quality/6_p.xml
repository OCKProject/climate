<p class="p">We analyzed air quality in the PD (present-day climate, present-day EGU emissions), MCCO (mid-century climate only), and MCA (mid-century adaptation) scenarios as described in the Methods. On a regional average, we find that climate change alone (MCCO versus PD) increases PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> by 58.6% (2.50 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> by 14.9% (8.06 parts per billion by volume [ppbv]). A larger change is found when comparing the present day to the mid-century adaptation scenario, which includes building air conditioning (MCA versus PD). In that case, PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> increases 61.1% (2.60 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> increases 15.9% (8.64 ppbv). Overall, 2.5% of the 61.1% increase in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and 1.0% of the 15.9% increase in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> are attributable to adaptive behavior (extra air conditioning use).
