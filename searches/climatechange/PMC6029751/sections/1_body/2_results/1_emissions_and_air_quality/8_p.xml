<p class="p">We examined the distribution of regional average concentrations as a function of air pollution level in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>. The number of hours with pollution at the highest levels increases due to climate change alone, and further rises given greater emissions of NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> and SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> associated with higher climate-induced electricity demand. For PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, the minimum regional average concentration simulated under a future climate (4.37 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> for MCCO) is above the average value for present-day (4.26 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>). Present-day values range from a minimum of 2.91 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> to a maximum 5.98 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. The highest regional average concentrations modeled under a future climate (8.75 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> for MCCO) are higher than we see at any time in the present-day simulation. The additional consideration of adaptation through air conditioning use further increases the minimum and maximum values to 4.48 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> and 8.87 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, respectively.
