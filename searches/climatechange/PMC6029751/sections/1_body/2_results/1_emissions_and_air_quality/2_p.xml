<p class="p">The higher temperatures seen in the mid-century scenarios drive changes in electricity demand, production, and associated emissions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows the hourly distribution of electricity production and emissions for current and future climates. These results show the response of electricity production to ambient temperature through demand for air conditioning. Under the future climate assumptions, regionally summed average hourly electricity demand increases from 213 to 274 GWh (28.6%), and regionally summed average hourly eastern US CO
