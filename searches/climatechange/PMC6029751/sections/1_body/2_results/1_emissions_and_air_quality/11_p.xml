<p class="p">Ozone exhibits many of the same patterns as exhibited by PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. However, the increase in hourly O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> is not as pronounced from the present-day to mid-century scenarios as seen for PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. In the case of O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, adaptive behavior is responsible for an approximately 1% increase in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>. Like PM

 <sub class="sub">X</sub> emissions. Small decreases due to localized emissions decreases from changes in electricity dispatch are also evident over South Carolina and Chesapeake Bay, as well as a highly localized decrease in Maine and a very small decrease along the Texas domain boundary.
