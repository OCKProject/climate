 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). This difference is due to the changing sensitivity of electricity generation as a function of temperature, with responsiveness increasing at higher temperatures and decreasing at cooler temperatures, when building cooling is less important. The distribution becomes less uniform in the mid-century climate as temperature dependence plays a greater role compared to other end uses of electricity.
