<p class="p">Biogenic emissions, enhanced under a warmer climate, are the dominant contributor to the MCCO increase in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. This impact is sensitive to the choice of chemical mechanism in the atmospheric model and details regarding the formation of secondary organic aerosol as a function of volatile organic compounds. Past studies have suggested that the CB05 mechanism in CMAQ may have errors in the representation of this atmospheric chemical process [

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> is notable, we focus our discussion on the changes due to building energy use (i.e., MCCO versus MCA).
