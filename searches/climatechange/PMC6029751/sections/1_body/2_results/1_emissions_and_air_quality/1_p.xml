<p class="p">Changes in energy demand associated with warmer temperatures are driven by the distribution of temperatures at hourly or even sub-hourly scales. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows a histogram of regional (eastern US) average hourly temperatures over the month of July for current and mid-century conditions. Results show a shift in the maximum ambient temperature from 32.4 °C (present) to 38.5 °C (future), an 18.8% increase. The mid-century scenario exhibits a decrease in the frequency of colder temperatures and an increase in the frequency of warmer temperatures.
