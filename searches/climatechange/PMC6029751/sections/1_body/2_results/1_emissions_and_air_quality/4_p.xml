<p class="p">Trends in the distribution of hourly electricity production and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions more closely follow changes in temperature than do emissions of NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> and SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed.1002599.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. Overall, emissions in the future climate scenario increase 13.7% for NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> and 17.2% for SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, but the maximum hourly emissions rate does not increase for either NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> or SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Rather, the increase in average hourly emissions of NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> and SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> occurs from greater frequency of emissions on the higher end of the present-day emissions distribution. Even as electricity demand increases, new peak electricity demand in the model is met by natural gas power plants that have little impact on NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> and SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions during peak conditions. Simulating likely retirements of coal-fired power plants and market-driven renewable energy investments would also result in lower emissions than found here, where we maintain the existing power plant inventory to explore the arising interactions between climate, energy production, and air quality without being predictive. This highlights the importance of considering cleaner energy sources in reducing future harmful emissions.
