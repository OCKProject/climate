 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. These metrics are not directly comparable as standards are met or achieved at the county or state level and are based on the fourth highest annual MDA8, whereas we present regional average hourly concentrations. Additionally, the standards may be lowered by mid-century, but this comparison highlights the relevance of results to attainment of regulatory standards. Overall, adaptation causes a 4.5% increase in the number of high O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> hours (defined as when regional average hourly O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> exceeds 60 ppbv) and a 22% increase in the number of high PM

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> is an annual average concentration of 12 μg/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. However, our analysis is limited to a sample size of the 744 hours of July and not directly comparable to the NAAQS.
