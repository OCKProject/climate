<p class="p">This study explores power plants and heat-driven electricity demand in buildings as an insufficiently understood mechanism of future air-quality-related health damages in a warmer climate. Here we parse the contribution of this adaptation, but the study limitations include modeling only a single representative month from 1 year in future climate projections. Typically, studies of climate would be based on a 30-year average of results, which is not computationally feasible for this type of study. Additionally, our results do not project future changes to population, air pollution exposure patterns in humans, building stock, and the electric power sector, but rather highlight the interactions amongst climate, electricity production, air quality, and health. With less computationally demanding methods, more simulations could be run over longer timeframes to test the sensitivity of results to potential changes. Future directions could also include assessing the impact of interventions for climate change mitigation and air pollution control. Lastly, health impacts assessment relies on C-R functions for O
