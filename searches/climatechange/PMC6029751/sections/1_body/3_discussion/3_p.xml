<p class="p">Quantifying the role of air conditioning adaptation in future air quality bears relevance to decision-making, as power sector emissions are controllable by technology and policy in a way that other climate-driven air quality mechanisms are not (i.e., chemical reaction rates, biogenic emissions, NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> from lightning, and wildfire emissions). The scenario chosen here highlights the role of interactive effects amongst climate, energy production, and air quality. Interventions would, and likely will, reduce the damages calculated here. Control options include stack-level technological controls, such as SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scrubbers and NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub> selective catalytic reduction, which have been the traditional approach employed by US air quality management agencies and power sector utilities to meet health-based standards. Although this technological approach would serve to reduce pollution exposure, such strategies do not modulate cost, energy use, or carbon emissions. In fact, end-of-pipe controls increase energy requirements to balance the decrease in plant efficiency associated with effluent treatment methods; this is often called the capacity or heat rate penalty.
