Efficiency measures would reduce demand on the electricity system, as well as associated carbon emissions, air quality impacts, and adverse health outcomes. Another option to reduce both carbon emissions and air-pollution-related health impacts would be to increase the portion of electricity generated by renewable sources like solar and wind. Studies show that the use of solar energy would reduce and has reduced fine particulates in the eastern US, especially on the highest concentration days [

All of these alternatives would mitigate climate change and reduce the air-pollution-related health burden from adaptation measures.
