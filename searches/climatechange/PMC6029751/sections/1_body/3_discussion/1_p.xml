<p class="p">Simulating adaptive behavior to a warmer mid-century climate shows that increased air conditioning use leads to higher emissions, degraded air quality, and adverse health outcomes. We find that the increase in air-pollution-related health outcomes attributable to climate change alone is 92%–95% of the overall health burden (depending on air pollutant), while changes in human behavior to adapt to climate change through increased air conditioning in buildings comprises 5%–8% of the health burden.</p>
