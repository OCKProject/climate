<p class="p">Few studies have explored the impact of climate change on health-damaging emissions from electricity generating units (EGUs), specifically emissions of nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and sulfur dioxide (SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), but we know there is a relationship between power plant emissions and temperature through electricity demand in buildings. Buildings are the largest source of US electricity demand, responsible for more than 60% of demand in most states in the eastern US (

Electricity for cooling is a large component of this demand, with direct correlation to rising temperatures. Abel et al. showed that historical eastern US EGU emissions of NO
 <sub class="sub">X</sub>, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) increase 3.3%–3.6% per 1 °C increase in daily temperature regionally over the summer [
