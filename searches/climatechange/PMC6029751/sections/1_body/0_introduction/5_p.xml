<p class="p">Additional emissions from increased air conditioning demand have been shown to have a significant impact on fine particulate matter (PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>), responsible for up to 87% of concentrations in the Pennsylvania–New Jersey–Maryland electricity grid interconnection during July 2006 heat wave conditions [

 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> mass, sulfate, and elemental carbon concentrations by 83%, 103%, and 310%, respectively, but the increase in emissions from anticipated heat-driven adaptation response is typically not included in air quality modeling studies [

Recent research has demonstrated the air-quality-related health benefit of the green building movement and reducing energy demand in buildings. MacNaughton et al. quantified the health benefits of US Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED)–certified buildings built from 2000 to 2016 as 172–405 avoided premature mortalities [
