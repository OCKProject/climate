<p class="p">Climate change poses many health risks, from elevated risk of heat stroke to the broadening reach of vector-borne disease, food insecurity, and air pollution [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. According to the Lancet Countdown on health and climate change, climate change “is affecting the health of populations around the world, today” [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002599.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Climate change has direct impacts on health and well-being from exacerbated extreme weather, extremes of the hydrologic cycle, and heat waves, as well as indirect effects such as increases in the burden of infectious disease, sea-level rise, ocean acidification, and climate-induced population displacement or conflict. Ultimately, these changes threaten access to clean air, water, and food, while potentially creating new health disparities and exacerbating existing ones. However, climate mitigation and adaptation strategies have the potential to address these issues and improve public health broadly. This study focuses on ambient air pollution, and the potential increase in adverse air-pollution-related health impacts associated with building air conditioning use, in response to warmer temperatures, highlighting the need for clean energy solutions as tools for improving public health.
