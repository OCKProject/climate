<p class="p">Air conditioning in buildings is a form of adaptation to warmer temperatures that could increase population health risks, by increasing power plant emissions on hot days. As air conditioning use increases to cool buildings, the increased demand for electricity is supplied by a mix of generation sources including fossil fuels, thus increasing harmful emissions. In this work, we deploy a novel interdisciplinary modeling effort to quantify the air pollution and health impacts of this climate change adaptation mechanism.</p>
