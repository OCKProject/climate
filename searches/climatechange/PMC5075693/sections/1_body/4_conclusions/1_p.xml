<p class="p">Medicinal plants represent a significant contribution to human health, and with the continuous development of global warming, some of wild medicinal plants would change their distribution patterns as well as quality. This study provided a new case for that theory. Firstly, samples of wild herb plant 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> were collected form field work in Qinling Mountains, and the content of schisantherin A in the fruit were examined by HPLC, then with this data combining fuzzy theory and a maximum entropy model, we developed a method to project the spatial assessment of medicinal plants quality, and used this model we predict future quality and distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. spenanthera</italic> in Qinling Mountains. The result showed that under future climate scenarios, the habitats of high quality 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> will continue to decrease and draw near to extinction. As the prediction of species distribution is influenced by multiple factors, this study predicted the effects of climate change on the distribution and quality of medicinal plants. Further research is required, and the present study only provides a reference for related research and native habitat protection.
