<p class="p">We used the same bioclimatic variables projected into the future. Potential values for bioclimatic variables for future climate conditions in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, were derived from three general circulation models (GCMs): BCCR-BCM2.0 (BC), CCCMA_CGCM3 (CC), and MIROC32_medres (MI), under for the SRES-A1B, SRES-A2 and SRES-B1 emission scenarios (

It covers a wide range of the main driving forces of future emissions, from demographic to technological and economic developments (

The SRES-A2 driven by economic growth although at regional scale, create a diversified political and social world and regionally oriented economic growth that is more fragmented and slower than that in other storylines. The SRES-B1 is undoubtedly the “greenest” of all projections, with high levels of environmental and social consciousness and a global sustained development (
