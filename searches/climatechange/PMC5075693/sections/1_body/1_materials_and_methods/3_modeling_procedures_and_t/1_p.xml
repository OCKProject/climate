 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). For defining the degree of suitability of all factors in a finite set (scope) for 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>, the values of the fuzzy membership using the statistical association between the content of schisantherin A and each factor was used to quantify the relation between habitat variables and habitat suitability. For each environmental variable, a suitability curve is defined that assigns every possible value of the variable a degree of suitability. The degree value ranges from 0 to 1. A value of 0 indicates that an attribute has complete non-membership (not suitable at all) in a fuzzy set, which means that under these environmental conditions, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> cannot grow or cannot completely synthesize and accumulate schisantherin A. Meanwhile, a value of 1 indicates that an attribute has a complete membership (optimal suitable) in a fuzzy set, which means that under these environmental conditions, the synthesis and accumulation of schisantherin A in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">sphenanthera</italic> is optimal, and the environment in this scenario is suitable for the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. Grades between 0 and 1 imply that an attribute has partial of membership in a fuzzy set. (
