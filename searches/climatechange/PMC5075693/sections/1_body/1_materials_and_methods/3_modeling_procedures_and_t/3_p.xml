<p class="p">After establishing the factorâ€™s fuzzy membership for 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>, the suitability ratings were calculated. To do so, assigning the weight of different factors is very important. This is the key to the reliability of the evaluation results. The factor weight is the contribution degree of the effects of factors to the growth and quality of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>, which varies among different factors. To eliminate subjective influence, the current study takes advantage of the maximum entropy method (MEM) to determine the weights of factors. MEM is a parameter that describes how many different alternative approaches exist with respect to a certain attribute. Maximum information entropy weighting models embody the observed characteristics of the data, and the greatest degree of avoiding the influence of artificial factors is achieved. At the same time, according to the degree of change in the data set, the multidimensional ecological dominant factors that affect the species distribution in space are identified. Additionally, it does not require much data, which are rarely available (
