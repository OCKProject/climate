 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). We chose the reasonable sampling sites by considering the different environmental conditions in traditional and original producing area of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera.</italic> Meanwhile, to improve the sampling accuracy, the sampling points were distributed evenly. But because of the influence of human activities, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> wild resources are being depleted, and some traditional areas where the plant could be found no longer host this species, at the same time in complex terrain, we are unable to obtain sample point data, so the spatial distribution of the sampling points in this study are not completely evenly distribution. At every sampling point, 10–20 plant samples had been collected, and to prevent cloning, the distance between samples was controlled more than 100 m. We used global positioning system (GPS) to record basic geographic information, including the longitude, latitude, altitude, slope and aspect. The

 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. Therefore, the content of schisantherin A in fruit of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> was chosen as the indicator, and it was tested by HPLC (
