<p class="p">The membership function was established to explore the relationships between factors and membership degrees by cure-fitting and drawing scatter diagrams. Because the interaction between the growth and quality of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> and ecological factors was quite different, different types of fuzzy membership functions were chosen to express their relationships. Therefore, in this research, gaussian-type functions were used for quantitative factors because most factors have upper and lower boundaries in which the membership degree is zero. The L trapezoidal function was used for quantitative factors that only had lower boundaries, and the R trapezoid type function was used for quantitative factors that only had upper boundaries. The membership degrees, extending from 0 to 1, can be calculated according to these membership functions. When the membership degree is 1, it is considered to be the best scenario of ecological factors suitable for the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. However, when the membership degree is 0, the ecological factor has a serious deficiency. The fitting degree of all membership functions varies from 76.20 % to 96.93 % (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), with an average of 84.09 %. This verifies our modelâ€™s accuracy.
