<p class="p">Climate change will significantly affect plant distribution. With the support of the ArcGIS 9.3 (Redlands, CA, USA) platform, we carried out statistics that can represent the future climate data in the model operations. To explore the relationships between climatic change and the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>, SPSS 19.0 software (IBM, Armonk, North Castle, NY, USA) was used to determine the correlations between Bio1 (annual mean temperature), Bio12 (annual precipitation) and the area proportion of the four habitat types of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> in the studied area. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows that Bio1, Bio12 and the area of highly suitable habitat have a significant negative correlation. As Bio1 and Bio12 increased, the highly suitable habitat area gradually decreased. To further explore this quantitative relation and future change trend, we performed linear regression analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>). The results indicate that when Bio1 of the studied area exceeds 20 °C and Bio12 exceeds 1200 mm, the study area will no longer have highly suitable habitat areas for 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. The result showed that climate change will affect the distribution and quality of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>, which will further increase the rate of this species’ extinction.
