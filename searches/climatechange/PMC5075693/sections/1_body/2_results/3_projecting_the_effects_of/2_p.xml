<p class="p">Using the projected climate data for the studied area, we reassessed the current 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> distribution to reflect a changing climate. These predictions provide a comprehensive assessment of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> ecological suitability. Using the same standard of classification, the future habitat suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> in the Qinling Mountains is classified into four grades. The data were derived from the average of the three types of GCMs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). The model forecast indicates that in the study area, the unsuitable habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> under climate change scenarios SRES-A1B and SRES-A2 were gradually increased. As time goes on, unsuitable habitat areas will expand in the northeast of Chongqing and the northwest of Hubei (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">4</xref>). The unsuitable habitat of SRES-B1 does not represent a large change, even a slight reduction with time. The marginally suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> under the three climate change scenarios would rapidly increase. The difference between the climate changes scenarios is a higher increasing rate in the SRES-A1B and SRES-A2 scenarios. The moderately suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> under all climate change scenarios remained relatively stable. The highly suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> under the climate change scenarios of SRES-A1B, SRES-A2 and SRES-B1 gradually decreased. Some of the differences between the climate change scenarios are worth mentioning. Generally, in the study area, a larger decline rate of highly suitable habitat area in both GCMs refers to the SRES-A1B and SRES-A2.
