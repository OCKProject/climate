<p class="p">The habitat suitability assessment model based on GIS and the fuzzy mathematics could be used to accurately determine the habitat suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> and to quantify the area of suitable habitat. Using it as a base, the future distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> in the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s under the climate change scenarios of SRES-A1B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), SRES-A2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) and SRES-B1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) from IPCC were projected. The SRES scenarios were constructed to explore future developments in the global environment with special reference to the production of greenhouse gases and aerosol precursor emissions, which is an important means of evaluating the future climate change.
