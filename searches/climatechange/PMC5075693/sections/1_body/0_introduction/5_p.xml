<p class="p">In this study, researchers collected 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> samples at 307 sampling points in 19 sampling sites and extracted schisantherin A using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Meanwhile, in order to test applicability of our model for other habitats besides the Qinling Mountains, 60 samples from four locations have been collected. We used a fuzzy set to determine the association of schisantherin A content with the 19 climatic variables. Then, the maximum entropy model was used to determine the weight of each variable. Finally, we estimated the spatial distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> in the Qinling Mountains using the weighted average method and geographical information system (GIS) spatial analysis. Researchers obtained the suitable range of each variable affecting plant growth and spatial distribution. By using this habitat-suitability assessment model and the same climatic data from three general circulation models (GCM) for three different climate change scenarios (Special Report On Emissions Scenarios, SRES) (SRES-A1B, SRES-A2 and SRES-B1 emission scenarios), the researchers predicted the potential geographic distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> in the Qinling Mountains for the years 2020–2029 (2020s), 2050–2059 (2050s) and 2080–2089 (2080s). This information will supply construction and advice for the protection and sustainable utilization of resources, and provide some measures and proposals for the prediction of the distribution and quality of medicinal plants under climate change conditions.
