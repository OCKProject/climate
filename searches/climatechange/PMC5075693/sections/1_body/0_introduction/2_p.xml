 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al., 2014</xref>). The production and quality of medicinal plants are not only influenced by plant genetic characteristics but are also closely related to various environmental factors. Specific geographic spatial information about species is an important part of species conservation (

 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al., 2013</xref>). This information is essential to addressing the many challenges facing species conservation, such as those induced by climate change, as well as other ecological or biological factors. It is also important for the domestication of wild species.
