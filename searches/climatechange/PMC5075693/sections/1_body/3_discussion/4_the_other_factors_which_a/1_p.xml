<p class="p">In addition to climate change, human interference is also an important factor in influencing the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. Theoretically, 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> can grow in all of the highly suitable habitats within the scope of its distribution area. Due to the effects of human activities such as over-grazing and wanton picking, wild 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> resources are facing depletion. Traditional habitats no longer host this species. The phenomenon of habitat fragmentation is irreversible. The proliferation ability of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> is also a key factor affecting its distribution. Because 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> is a woody vine, its growth has more stringent environmental requirements. Research has shown that land cover types in the highly suitable habitats of
 <italic class="italic"> S. sphenanthera</italic> include broad-leaved evergreen forests that provide support to climbing plants (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). Future climate warming will impact the highly suitable habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. Additionally, the distribution of the highly suitable habitats of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> would shift to higher latitudes in response to climate change. However, in the studied area, like northern Shaanxi and some parts of the eastern Gansu area, the present vegetation type is not suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> growth. At present, because the understanding level and the technical conditions are limiting, this study cannot include all factors influencing the distribution and quality of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. If all factors were considered, we can deduce that in the study area, the suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> under the climate change scenarios would reduce by a larger range, and new suitable habitat range will be smaller.
