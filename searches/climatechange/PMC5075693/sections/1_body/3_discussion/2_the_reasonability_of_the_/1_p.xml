<p class="p">Bioclimatic variables are derived from the monthly temperature and rainfall values in order to generate more biologically meaningful variables. These variables were created by the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables, and the uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation was quantified by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. All of this guarantees the accuracy of the bioclimatic data (
