<p class="p">Previous researches indicated that temperature and the moisture factor (especially in spring and autumn) are the main climate factors which control the growth of plants (

 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> is a woody vine, supporting itself on rocks, shrubs, and trees in broad-leaved evergreen forests or coniferous mixed forests (

 <italic class="italic">S. spenanthera</italic>. In 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic> growth process, the period of sap flow begin in early March, and the sprout leaves period is from late March to mid-April, in this period, low temperature or low rainfall will kill the buds or delay sprout leaves period. In late April 
 <italic class="italic">S. spenanthera</italic> begin to blossom, and the blossom and young fruit period continue to end of June, at the same time itâ€™s also a peak-growth period. The developing fruit period is begin in early July, and the fruit ripe period begin in early August, then its followed by abscission period which last from October to November, and from July to September is the warmest quarter in study area and usually, the wettest month also happen in this three months, it is the key period for generation and accumulation of schisantherin A. Therefore, in the whole growth period, suitable temperature and precipitation is significant for 
 <italic class="italic">S. sphenanthera</italic>. The bioclimatic variables represent annual trends, seasonality, and extreme or limiting temperature and precipitation factors in plant life history, so they are sufficient for this research.
