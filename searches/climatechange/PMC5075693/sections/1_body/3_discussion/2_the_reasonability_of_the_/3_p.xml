These five dominant features are Bio7 (temperature annual range), Bio16 (precipitation of the wettest quarter), Bio18 (precipitation of the warmest quarter), Bio12 (annual precipitation) and Bio1 (annual mean temperature). The weight of each of these features is higher than 6 %. Our results are therefore somewhat similar with those of
