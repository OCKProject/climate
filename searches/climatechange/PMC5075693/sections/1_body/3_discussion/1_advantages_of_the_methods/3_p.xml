<p class="p">Habitat requirements and spatial distribution of species are essential to biological conservation and management. In this study, our aim is to establish a universal model for simulation quality of wild herbs in different environmental conditions, which means For wild medical plant without explicit habitat requirements, this study can only be use the information provided by the statistical data to build up a model, and according to the research target, this model should not only forecast spatial variation of medicinal plants quality, but also can determine the mathematical relationship between value of each impact factor and the content of effective composition in wild herbs. Therefore, the general statistical model cannot meet the requirements of this study. Moreover, the samples data in this study were collected by field work in Qinling Mountains, every data consumed extremely labor, material, and financial resources, especially in mountains or regions of complex terrain. Thus, only limited data was provided for model building, it canâ€™t meet the requirements of other machine learning model such as artificial neural network model, support vector machine, and random forest. At the same time, most of the machine learning models are a black-box model, which cannot show relationship between the value of each impact factor and the content of effective composition. This means machine learning models are also not suitable for this study. However, Fuzzy mathematics provides a way to solve this problem. Firstly, fuzzy membership function can standardize the factors with no prior knowledge and retain the information of original data. Secondly, through this method we can obtain suitable range of each factor for medical plant, and this information is significant for wildlife protection. Finally, this method does not require large amounts of data, and gives a satisfactory result.</p>
