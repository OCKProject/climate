GIS is an important tool for the analysis of medicinal plantsâ€™ ecological suitability using species presence records associated with environmental variables to determine the essential environmental requirements of a particular species. The suitability evaluation model was integrated with the GIS software ArcGIS, which could quickly provide evaluation results after inputting the parameters of the model. Fuzzy theory was widely used in ecological environment modeling (

 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mouton et al., 2011</xref>), and how to determine membership function is a crux of this theory. Usually, the parameters of fuzzy membership functions were calculated based on the expert knowledge (

But in this study, to make sure the consistency between the sampling data and the bioclimatic data, we extract bioclimatic variables values by sampling sites, and then get the bioclimatic data sequence for model training. Finally, using this data, the fuzzy membership function was defined, which include the information on relationship between the value of 19 climatic variables and schisantherin A content of
