For principal component analysis, to get reasonable results, the model requires a lot of data, so it is not suitable for this research. MEM is an objective approach using information provided by the observation data to determine the weight of climatic variables. It can objectively evaluate the habitat suitability and eliminate subjective influence. MEM emphasizes the influence of strongly restrictive factors on targets. Moreover it determines the dominant influencing factor of schisantherin A.
