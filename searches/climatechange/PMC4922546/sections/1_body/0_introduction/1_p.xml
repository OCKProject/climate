<p class="p">Currently, an increasing societal demand to anticipate the future impacts and costs of climate change challenges the climate research community, since projections of climate change impacts should be based on a robust and reliable climatological input. To estimate the bandwidth of possible future impacts, a balanced and unbiased estimate of the entire distribution of possible future changes is required. This bandwidth is often estimated by driving impact models with few selected climate scenarios, the selection being largely subjective or determined by practical reasoning such as availability. This work presents a method for selecting the climate input for climate change impact assessments in a more objective way, which aims to avoid sampling biases, to properly account for uncertainties and to save computational resources.</p>
