<p class="p">Assuming an unbiased MME, the model selection should conserve the statistical properties of the original MME as far as possible. A further complication arises if MMEs cannot be regarded as unbiased, which is usually due to sampling and model interdependence issues, as discussed in the next section. A sensible selection of climate simulations as input for climate change impact studies is needed in any case, either to limit computational demand and/or to mitigate biases in the ensemble statistics. Currently, such selection is often done “by opportunity” based on the ease of access to climate simulations or by subjective criteria. Only few systematic methods for model selection have been published so far (Smith and Hulme

Our study adds to this field by describing a multivariate method to select representative RCM or GCM simulations from a larger MME for impact investigations based on cluster analysis. The basic aim of the method is to provide a flexible tool for model selection, that can easily be adapted to different applications in climate change impact research. The method mitigates sampling and interdependence-biases, and effectively reduces the ensemble size with a minimal loss of information.
