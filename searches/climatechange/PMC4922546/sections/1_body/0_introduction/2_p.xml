<p class="p">The most detailed information on future climate is provided by General Circulation Models (GCMs), often refined with regional climate models (RCMs) and empirical-statistical post-processing methods (e.g. Maraun 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2013</xref>; Theme√ül et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, as with any future scenario, they are subject to considerable uncertainties (e.g. Tebaldi and Knutti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2007</xref>) originating from the chaotic behavior of the climate system and the unknown future evolution of greenhouse gas concentrations and other forcing agents of the climate system, as well as simplifications and errors in climate models. Those inherent uncertainties are often investigated using multi-model ensembles (MMEs), which challenges climate change impact assessments to base their investigations on multi-model climatological input.
