<p class="p">As MMEs usually do not systematically sample components of model uncertainty (e.g. parameterizations), and thus do not stem from an experimental design in a statistical sense, they cannot be expected to represent unbiased distributions of possible future climate states (Knutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2010b</xref>). For example, interdependence between models may induce biases, since interdependent models gain too much weight in ensemble statistics if they are counted as independent ones. Studies by Pennell and Reichler (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2010</xref>) and Masson and Knutti (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2011</xref>) showed that GCM ensembles feature considerable model dependence, leading to a smaller effective ensembles size than the number of models in the ensemble. Such dependencies can lead to biased estimations of both mean and width of the distribution.
