<p class="p">A somewhat different approach to obtain a balanced ensemble is suggested by Whetton et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2012</xref>). They recommend shrinking the ensemble to a set of representative simulations that capture certain characteristics of the whole sample. This subset should then be used as a consistent forcing for various impact models. Methods to conduct such a selection are discussed in the next section.
