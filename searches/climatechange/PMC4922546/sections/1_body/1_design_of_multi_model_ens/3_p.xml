<p class="p">This problem is even worse in GCM-RCM MMEs, where an additional layer of uncertainty is introduced by nesting regional models into global models. Frequently some GCMs are used to provide boundary conditions for several RCMs in the ensemble, while others are used only once. Similar boundary conditions generate substantial interdependencies between the results of RCMs, leading to an unbalanced ensemble. Some methods to mitigate this problem by statistically reconstructing RCM simulations in order to obtain an ensemble in which each GCM-RCM combination appears exactly once are described in the literature (e.g. Déqué et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2011</xref>; Heinrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>).
