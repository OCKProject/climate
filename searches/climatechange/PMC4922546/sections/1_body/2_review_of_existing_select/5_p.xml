<p class="p">This leads to a further model selection criterion, namely the conservation of statistical properties of the climate change signals: the sub-sample of the selected simulations should properly represent uncertainties. Recently, methods have been published based on this idea, partly combined with some pre-selection based on model performance (e.g. McSweeney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2012</xref>; Bishop and Abramowitz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2013</xref>).
