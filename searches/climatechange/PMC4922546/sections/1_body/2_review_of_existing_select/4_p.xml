<p class="p">In the literature, models are often selected based only on their performance in the past, without regarding spread in the climate change signals, with the aim to use only the “best” models. However, correlations between past performance and future climate change signals are known to be very weak (Knutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2010b</xref>), which means that there is no clear indication that the best performing models in the past are most realistic with regard to climate change signal. In addition, the ranking of models with regard to performance in the past is highly dependent on the definition of the performance measure (e.g. Jury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2015</xref>), which leads to a very subjective ranking. Therefore it seems reasonable that model performance in the past should rather be used to detect and remove severely unrealistic models that cannot be trusted in their future projections for some clearly argued reasons, but not to select a few “best performing” models, since there is no indication that they are more realistic in their future projections than other reasonably performing models.
