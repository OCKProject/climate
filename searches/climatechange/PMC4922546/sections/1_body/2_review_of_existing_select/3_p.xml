<p class="p">The Good Practice Guidance Paper on Assessing and Combining Multi Model Climate Projections (Knutti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2010a</xref>) gives some more recent recommendations for model selection, also addressing the issue of model dependence. Knutti et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2010a</xref>) argue that agreement between models may arise due to the fact that models use similar simplifications and may feature similar errors. This means that models do not represent independent information and should be down-weighted in order to avoid biases in the statistical analysis of the ensemble, which are induced by double-counting similar models (Pirtle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>). Model selection can be regarded as a binary 0â€“1 weighting that should address these issues. Several impact studies address this problem of double-counting (e.g. Finger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2012</xref>). Evans et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2013</xref>) presents a selection method taking into account model performance and independence in climate change signals. This method selects models that are most independent from the rest of the entire ensemble.
