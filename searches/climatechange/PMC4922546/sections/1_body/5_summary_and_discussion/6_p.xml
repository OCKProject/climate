 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2015</xref>) proposes a very interesting alternative model selection algorithm, addressing the same problems as are presented in this work (multivariate set-up and model dependency). However, in contrast to the method proposed in this work, in Cannonâ€™s method the selected models are uniquely identified. This surely makes model selection simpler, but there is no flexibility for the user to add some subjective selection criteria when sampling, like the inclusion of an extremely well-performing simulation.
