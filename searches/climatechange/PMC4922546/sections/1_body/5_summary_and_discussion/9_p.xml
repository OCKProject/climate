<p class="p">In summary, we present a flexible method to select models from an ensemble of simulations conserving the model spread and accounting for model similarity. This method reduces computational costs for climate impact modeling and enhances the quality of the ensemble at the same time, as it prevents double-counting of dependent simulations that would lead to biased statistics.</p>
