<p class="p">The sub-ensemble of selected simulations conserves the main climate change characteristics of the entire ensemble, but it might not share identical statistical properties like mean and standard deviation. This is a desirable property, as unbalanced ensemble designs often lead to biased estimates due to double-counting induced by model dependencies. For balanced and thus unbiased ensembles, like for reconstructed datasets (Heinrich et al.
