<p class="p">Our method generalizes the pragmatic approach of finding the model spread of climate change signals of, say, temperature against precipitation (IPCC-TGICA 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2007</xref>). It allows for simultaneous analysis of an arbitrary number of meteorological parameters over several spatial regions of interest, and brings forth dominant patterns of climate change. Model similarities are detected based entirely on those patterns of projected change. This stands in contrast to most other studies, which find similarities in the 20th century historical runs (e.g. Abramowitz and Gupta

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2012</xref>). An interesting aspect for further research would be the question of how model similarities in historical runs and dependencies in future projections relate over time.
