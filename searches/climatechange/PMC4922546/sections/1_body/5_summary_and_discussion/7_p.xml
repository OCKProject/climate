<p class="p">We demonstrate the presented model selection procedure with the ENSEMBLES multi-model dataset (SectionÂ 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5</xref>). Our results show that the first two most dominant patterns of change relate to temperature and humidity and that the dataset can be split into 5 groups of similar simulations. An important factor for model similarity in this setting is the GCM forcing of the RCM. Interestingly, some GCM forcings lead to very dense clusters (
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r3</italic>), while others are very heterogeneous and may even be split among different groups of similarity. This is particularly the case for the different initial conditions of 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">r1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">r2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">r3</italic>), each of which induces a distinct behavior of the RCMs. On the other hand, some driving GCMs do not create their own clusters at all (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">MIROC</italic>). In our example application this leads to a selection where two GCMs appear twice, while others are omitted entirely. Selecting simulations from each GCM would not necessarily span the entire uncertainty range.
