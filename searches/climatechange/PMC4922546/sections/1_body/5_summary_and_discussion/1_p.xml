<p class="p">In order to provide sound meteorological input for climate change impact studies, it is important to address the uncertainty induced by climate simulations. We present a simple tool to aid users in selection of appropriate climate simulations (either GCMs or RCMs) as input for their studies. The aim of the proposed method is to sample the climate model uncertainty, find model similarities, and sub-select models that are as independent as possible while conserving the spread of the full ensemble.</p>
