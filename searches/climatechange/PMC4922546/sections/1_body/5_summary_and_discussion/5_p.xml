<p class="p">It should be noted that the proposed method does not deliver one single and unique subset. Instead the user has to decide on how to select one simulation out of each cluster. This can be done with probabilistic (random) sampling or non-probabilistic sampling. We do not recommend any type of random sampling as it is vulnerable to random sampling error: the randomness of the selection can result in a subset which is not representative for the ensemble. The probability of such a misspecification increases with decreasing sample size. For such small sample sizes it is more advisable to take most extreme simulations so as to sample the entire model spread.</p>
