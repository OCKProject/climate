<p class="p">The MME used here is the multi-model dataset from the ENSEMBLES project. The 27 ENSEMBLES regional climate model simulations are driven by 6 different GCMs which are all forced by the SRES A1B emission scenario (Nakicenovic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2000</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5</italic> GCM appears three times using different initializations and the 
 <italic class="italic">HadCM3</italic> GCM also shows up with three different parameterization schemes (
 <italic class="italic">Q0</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Q3</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Q16</italic>). One RCM (
 <italic class="italic">KNMI-RACMO</italic>) has been forced by all three 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5</italic> realizations, but with a coarser horizontal resolution of 50 km. One other simulation has been driven with this resolution as well, while the remaining 23 simulations have a 25 km resolution. As one simulation (
 <italic class="italic">GKSS-CCLM4.8-IPSL</italic>) lacks the variables 
 <italic class="italic">HURS</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">RSDS</italic>, it has been omitted in this study. In addition one simulation (
 <italic class="italic">OURANOS-CRCM-CGCM3</italic>) shows very noticeable biases and has been excluded as well, leaving 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=25 regional climate simulations for the analysis. The baseline period for the climate change signal (CCS) is the 30 years average of 1971 to 2000. The future scenario period to determine the climate change signal is chosen to be 2021 to 2050.
