<p class="p">The tree-like dependency structure is visualized by a dendrogram in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The height of the branches depicts the measure of dissimilarity between simulations and clusters with regard to the common patterns of climate change. To detect the optimal number of clusters, we observe the dissimilarity measure at each step when incrementally merging the closest pair of clusters into a single one. Before the dissimilarity significantly increases, we stop merging to obtain a set of dissimilar clusters each obtaining similar simulations. The dissimilarity measure at each increment is shown as a bar plot in Fig.
