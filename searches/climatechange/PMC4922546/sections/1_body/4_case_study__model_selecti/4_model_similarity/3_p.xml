<p class="p">We show partitions with 5 clusters to visualize the range of reasonable clustering. Notably, simulations driven by the lateral boundary conditions of the GCMs 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r3</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">BCM</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ARPEGE</italic> show very strong GCM-specific clustering, meaning that those RCMs driven by the same GCM behave rather similarly with regard to the common patterns of climate change. Further, 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r3</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">BCM</italic>-driven simulations tend to be more similar than 
 <italic class="italic">ARPEGE</italic> models. Interestingly, the 50 km versions of the RCM 
 <italic class="italic">KNMI-RACMO</italic> driven by 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r1</italic> and by 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r2</italic> behave rather differently than the 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r3</italic>-driven version and are spread among different clusters. Also forced with 
 <italic class="italic">ECHAM5-r3</italic>, the simulations 
 <italic class="italic">KNMI-RACMO</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SMHI-RCA</italic> both have identical set-ups using both a 25 km and a 50 km resolution. In each case, the similarity is very high. On the other hand, RCMs driven by the three 
 <italic class="italic">HadCM3</italic> GCMs show quite some heterogeneity: On the one hand they are split among two clusters of different sizes. On the other hand, RCMs driven by different 
 <italic class="italic">HadCM3</italic> GCMs can be found in either cluster. Also, the 
 <italic class="italic">MIROC</italic>-driven 
 <italic class="italic">KNMI-RACMO</italic> does not form a cluster of its own but behaves similarly to 
 <italic class="italic">HadCM3</italic>-driven RCMs.
