<p class="p">The most dominant climate change pattern (PC1) is largely linked to the temperature change along all four seasons for all European subregions. PC2 shows a negative relationship between relative humidity (HURS) and global radiation (RSDS). This means that simulations projecting a higher change in HURS than others tend to project a lower change in RSDS. This anti-correlation seems to hold for the entire European region in winter (DJF) and for the northern and eastern parts of Europe in the remaining seasons, especially in spring (MAM) and autumn (SON). A positive correlation of humidity and precipitation can be detected for the Scandinavian region over the whole year and in winter for mid- and eastern Europe and the Alpine region. PC3 shows a humidity-precipitation pattern for the southern regions for MAM (not shown).</p>
