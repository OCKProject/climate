<p class="p">Our model selection approach identifies 5 groups of similar simulations. As shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, these groups also show dependencies, some more than others, but by far not as strong as between the individual simulations. By selecting one simulation from each cluster, we definitely reduced the model dependency and obtained a more independent ensemble. We decided to select an average climate simulation and 4 extreme simulations to span the uncertainty range.
