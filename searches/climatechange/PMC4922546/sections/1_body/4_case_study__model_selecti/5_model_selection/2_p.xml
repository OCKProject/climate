<p class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> depicts the climate change signals of the regional climate simulations in the principal component space of the first three PCs. Simulations close to 0 can be interpreted as having an “average pattern” of the climate change induced by the corresponding principal component. The sign and order of magnitude in the scatter plot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) corresponds to the pattern described in the corresponding PC from the loadings plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. For PC1 (warming pattern), simulations within cluster 1 show the highest changes, whereas clusters 2 and 5 tend to have cooler projections and cluster 3 is average. For PC2 (humidity pattern) cluster 4 and cluster 3 show distinct behavior. PC3 (precipitation and humidity pattern) mostly distinguishes between clusters 2, 3 and 5.
