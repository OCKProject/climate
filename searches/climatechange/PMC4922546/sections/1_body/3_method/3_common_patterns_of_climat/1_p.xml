<p class="p">First, all area-averaged climate change signals of the meteorological parameters (like temperature and precipitation) have to be standardized, as different variables may have different units and variabilities. Then, with a PCA for each simulation, we transform the climate change signals to a linear combination of those variables. Those transformed meteorological variables are formally called principal components (PCs) and they form the

 <italic class="italic">patterns of climate change</italic> (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The transformations, which are the coefficients of the linear combinations, are called 
 <italic class="italic">loadings</italic> and they describe which meteorological variables are combined to form a particular pattern of climate change. The PCs of each simulation (i.e. patterns of climate change) are treated in the same way as meteorological variables, but they differ in being stochastically independent of each other, which is necessary for the subsequent cluster analysis.
