<p class="p">In the next step the most dominant patterns of climate change signals have to be detected in order to reduce noise and make the subsequent cluster analysis more robust. We use the broken-stick method (Jolliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>), which compares the variances of individual PCs of the used dataset with the theoretical variances of a randomly generated dataset. If those random variances are equal or larger than the observed ones, the corresponding PC can be regarded as noise and should be excluded (Fig.Â
