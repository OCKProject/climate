<p class="p">Having such a complex set-up, it is necessary to decrease the dimensionality of the climate parameters to eliminate collinearities and to reduce random noise. This is done by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify 
 <italic class="italic">patterns of climate change</italic> as step (1) (Jolliffe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2002</xref>). Step (2) finds model similarities with a hierarchical clustering algorithm (Huth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>) and finally, step (3) involves sampling the simulations from each cluster detected. We assume that unrealistic simulations have been sorted out in advance of the study. The next sections explain these steps in more detail.
