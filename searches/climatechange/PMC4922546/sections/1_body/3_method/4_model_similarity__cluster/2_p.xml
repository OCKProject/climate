<p class="p">Having obtained a tree-like structure of the dependence of the simulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), the open question of how many simulations to actually select from the ensemble still remains. There is no unique and best solution to this problem, but there are some criteria for how to obtain an optimal number of clusters. Our approach is to consider the distance criterion for each agglomeration step, which in the case of Ward’s criterion is the variance increase of the newly merged two clusters. We cut the tree where this increase of variance does not change considerably (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
