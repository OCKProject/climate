<p class="p">The aim here is to find groups of simulations based on their behavior with regard to the common climate change patterns obtained from the PCA. Those groups of simulations are found based on a hierarchical clustering algorithm which works like this: first, each simulation is assigned to its own cluster, and then the algorithm proceeds by iteratively joining the two closest clusters in each agglomeration step until one cluster remains. The measure of distance is based on Wardâ€™s criterion, which finds new clusters with minimal variance. This procedure tends to find compact and spherical groups of data. Hierarchical clustering results in a tree-like similarity structure, which is meaningful if we believe that some clusters might be more closely related to other clusters.</p>
