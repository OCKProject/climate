<p class="p">We extend the idea of non-probability sampling (see Section 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">3</xref>) by sampling one simulation out of each group of similar models obtained from the cluster analysis. This approach is also known as quota sampling, where one selects members out of each group using key information or characteristics relevant to the phenomenon being studied. This can be done by picking simulations from the scatter plot of the PCs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Another way would be to look at the distribution of the PCs for each simulation individually, which can be displayed with a bar-chart denoting their location within the scatter plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). One starts with an average simulation where all bars/PCs are close to 0 and then selects one simulation with distinct extreme characteristics from each cluster.
