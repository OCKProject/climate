<p class="p">The following model selection method samples one representative climate simulation out of groups of models with similar characteristics, to obtain a sub-set of independent simulations that cover the multi-model ensemble spread. These groups are found using clustering techniques. The model spread and the similarity measure can be defined using an arbitrary number of climate parameters and indicators. In addition, multiple spatial regions and seasons of interest can be freely defined. Therefore, this method is not limited to the commonly used temperature and precipitation changes of a single region, but is rather a multivariate extension.</p>
