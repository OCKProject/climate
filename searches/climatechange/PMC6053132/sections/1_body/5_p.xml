<p class="p">Predicting clearly defined outcomes of climate change can be exceedingly complex. This is because most research suggests that hotter temperatures and altered rainfall can favor or disfavor some species of helminths or their snail (or insect-vector) hosts over others. It is also possible that hotter temperatures and droughts can work synergistically or in competition with key social determinants and control efforts through MDA. Furthermore, infrastructural developments and subsequent changes in human exposure add another dimension to consider, especially in parts of Africa and China that are rapidly altering local ecosystems through construction of dams and other projects. Ultimately, climate change forecasts can be used to guide and inform future treatment plans. Described below are some possible global trends for the major worm species currently infecting large human populations.</p>
