<p class="p">In contrast to the example above, in the case of lymphatic filariasis (LF), which has been slated for elimination via MDA [

For LF, global elimination efforts may depend on a race between MDA and climate change-induced expansion of vector ranges, or they might require introducing new or intensified vector control management programs.
