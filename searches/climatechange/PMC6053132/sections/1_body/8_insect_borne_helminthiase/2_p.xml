<p class="p">There are several species of filarial-transmitting mosquitos that could proliferate through future expansions of tropical and subtropical regions [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006370.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Indeed, one study used maximum entropy ecological niche modeling to predict that the current at-risk population could grow from 543–804 million (a figure approximately in line with current WHO estimates) to 1.65–1.86 billion due to the effects of climate change and population growth [

Further, a 2007 surveillance study of vector-borne diseases in Nepal found that there has been a shift of LF transmission from lowland and hill districts (targeted by MDA campaigns beginning in 2003) to the country’s mountain regions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006370.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Areas of higher altitude were previously considered low-risk due to the inability of mosquito vectors to survive there. Thus, anticipated climate changes might be advantageous for LF transmission and could demand an expansion in global MDA or vector control efforts, especially in areas that were not previously considered vulnerable for LF endemicity.
