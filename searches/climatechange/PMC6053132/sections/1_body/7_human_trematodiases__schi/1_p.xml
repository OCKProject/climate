<p class="p">For parasitic worms that have digenetic lifecycles or otherwise require secondary hosts in their reproductive cycles, determining the effects of climate change demands analyses of how snail intermediate hosts will fare in the coming decades. In the case of schistosomiasis, some studies suggest that continuous high temperatures in parts of Africa, such as coastal East Africa and elsewhere, explain why 
 <italic class="italic">Biomphalaria</italic> spp. cannot survive or sustain 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma mansoni</italic> transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006370.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Therefore, several studies of various host snail species in Africa indicate that (with some exceptions) climate change linked to higher temperatures, as well as periods of drought or algal blooms, could significantly reduce the range and abundance of these intermediate hosts [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006370.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. However, habitat contractions in some parts of Africa might be partially compensated by schistosome-transmitting snails entering cooler areas of Southern Africa [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006370.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Similarly, global warming could potentially promote the expansion of
