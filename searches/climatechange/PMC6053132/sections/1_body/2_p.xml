<p class="p">Schistosomiasis in Africa is an example of the complexities of climate change interacting with urbanization and MDA. The hotter and drier conditions expected for many parts of Africa might reduce the continent’s overall incidence of schistosome infections by decimating freshwater snail populations, which serve as intermediate hosts for the digenetic blood trematodes [

However, not all species will suffer ill effects of environmental change, and these differential responses will influence disease burden. Ultimately, Africa’s anticipated future economic development—together with expansion of praziquantel MDA and the possible development of a schistosomiasis vaccine—might eventually reinforce the effects of snail decimation due to climate change, thereby accelerating the elimination of schistosomiasis on the African continent.
