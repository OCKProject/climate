However, we lack an understanding of the effect of resource inequality when diverse actors interact together towards a common goal. Here, we report the results of a collective-risk dilemma experiment in which groups of individuals were initially given either equal or unequal endowments. We found that the effort distribution was highly inequitable, with participants with fewer resources contributing significantly more to the public goods than the richer &#x02212;sometimes twice as much. An unsupervised learning algorithm classified the subjects according to their individual behavior, finding the poorest participants within two &#x0201c;generous clusters&#x0201d; and the richest into a &#x0201c;greedy cluster&#x0201d;. Our results suggest that policies would benefit from educating about fairness and reinforcing climate justice actions addressed to vulnerable people instead of focusing on understanding generic or global climate consequences.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Generalitat de Catalunya (ES)</institution></funding-source><award-id>2013 DI

While climate change mitigation requires a collective action, it is not clear what are the effects of the inherent diversity of the agents involved in it [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There is the risk that the poor exploits the rich, i.e., that the largest beneficiaries of a common goods bear a disproportionately large burden in its production [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Conversely, the poor also have an incentive to contribute since they are risking as much as any other in the event of a catastrophic development.</p><p>Inequality between actors is a widespread situation related to climate change mitigation which occurs at all the socioeconomic scales, from large nations and corporations to citizens that share a given urban space. For instance, increasing green spaces and similar actions that improve urban environmental health are part of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) within the Paris Agreement (COP21) [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, these actions impact differently more and less affluent citizens and, in fact, such actions have also been questioned from the perspective of environmental justice [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is the reason for the increasing interest in linking climate justice with socio-economic inequalities and in incorporating some behavioral aspects in city policy [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how to deal with climate change mitigation in an economically diverse world and in an environmentally fair manner is of special interest. This has become more timely and pressing with the withdrawal [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] of the second largest CO<sub>2</sub> emitter [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] from COP21.</p><p>Resource heterogeneity and environmental justice can be very suitably framed within the collective-risk dilemma experimental setup introduced by Milinski <italic>et al</italic>. a decade ago [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In this framework, to be described in detail below, groups of people have to work together to reach a common goal by making contributions from an initial endowment. If the goal is reached, every individual receives the part of the money not contributed. If not, a catastrophe occurs with certain probability, and all participants lose all the money they had kept. While many experimental and theoretical studies have considered different aspects of climate change within this framework [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the issue of heterogeneity has only been considered in three experiments framed in the climate change issue. Tavoni et al. [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] included inequality by separating the participants into two groups with different starting endowments, and found that the common goal was less likely to be reached. However, when they allowed participants to communicate their intentions, the probability of reaching the target goal increased again, similarly to conditional cooperation in public goods games [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. On the other hand, Milinski <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] observed that when they included rich and poor subjects, rich ones substituted for missing contributions by the poor provided intermediate climate targets, however, despite this increase in the contributions of the rich, the final target was reached less often than the intermediate target. Finally, Burton-Chellew and colleagues [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] proposed a game with four conditions varying the initial endowments and/or the risk of a catastrophic climate event. They found that inequality in both endowments and risk decreased cooperation, that is to say, selfishness emerged when rich were less at risk. However, some rich players were still reluctant to cooperate when they suffered the higher risk. It seems that climate change awareness could have mediated their responses, since it was found to be proportional with individual contributions. Outside of the climate change framing, studies on the role of heterogeneous endowments in public goods games are not conclusive, with different experiments leading to different results [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Therefore, new studies are needed to understand the influence of heterogeneity in threshold public goods games.</p><p>Here, we extend the knowledge on the effects of resource heterogeneity in collective dilemmas in two main directions. First, we include broader capital distributions, thus representing more closely the diversity in resource availability among the members of a given collective public goods game, e.g., between different countries worldwide or inhabitants in a given urban context. Second, and most importantly, we go beyond aggregate results to analyze the behavior of individuals by means of agnostic classification tools that allow us to identify differences between the behavior of subjects with the same resources. We complement this analysis with a questionnaire probing into the subjects&#x02019; knowledge of the climate change crisis and the influence of such knowledge in their actions. Therefore, we provide a much more complete picture of the influence of inequality that encompasses both the collective (reaching the common goal) and the individual (how different individuals behave under different circumstances) visions of the problem. Such a two-level approach is the best option in order to identify how agents react to resource heterogeneity and what actions must be taken to promote environmental justice. As we show below, our findings allow to hint directions for policy measures targeted to specific collectives.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The experiment was conducted following the lab-in-the-field experiment guidelines used in [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], which helped us recruiting participants from a general audience by using opportunistic recruitment, opposed to the typical samples of university undergraduate students. All participants in the experiment signed an informed consent to participate and no association was ever made between their real names and the results, in agreement with the Spanish Law for Personal Data Protection. This procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The experiment was conducted in different sessions in the DAU fair in Barcelona during two days (December 12-13, 2015) by means of the Citizen Social Lab platform developed ad hoc for this experiment [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The total number of games was 54, the number of participants in our experiment was 324 subjects, adding up to a total of 3240 game decisions collected. If some participant was non-responsive, the experimental platform took over and make the contribution randomly for her; in that case the data was labeled and the subject&#x02019;s decisions were discarded in the analysis. The total number of subjects with uncorrupted decisions are 320 (134 women, 41.8%) leading to a total number of valid decisions of 3200. The age ranged from 11 to 73 years, 32.15 (13.04) on average (SD), there are no significant differences between the behaviour of minors (&#x0003c; 18) and adults at the level of individual contribution, nor between games in which there are minors and adults coexisting and in which there are only adults (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s018">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s019">S3</xref> Tables). Almost half of the sample was graduated (48%), whereas the other half was equally distributed between different educational levels (i.e. professional training (16%), elementary (11%), middle (11%) and high school (12%). Most of the participants were na&#x000ef;ve to social experiments (N = 279, 86%). Average (SD) earnings were 18.21 &#x020ac; (8.8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s014">S14 Fig</xref>) and the average (SD) duration of a game (considering only the time of decision making) was 82.21s (20.98), hence the average round time was 8.22s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s015">S15 Fig</xref>).</p><p>Before starting the game, all the participants were shown a brief tutorial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s016">S16 Fig</xref>) in the tablet in which the experiment was implemented. Researchers present in the experiment reviewed the instructions with them to guarantee they were understanding the basics of the experiment. Participants were reminded that they had to make a decision on each round on how much money they want to contribute to the common goal, but they were not instructed in any particular way nor with any particular goal in mind.</p><p>The subjects participated in groups of six players, each subject was assigned with an initial capital (20 &#x020ac; to 60 &#x020ac;), and the goal of the game was to contribute 120 &#x020ac; on a common fund between all of them. During the game the subjects had to contribute into the common fund between 0 &#x020ac; and 4 &#x020ac; during 10 rounds. At the end of each round all players saw the information of how much money has been contributed to the common fund, and they also saw the individual contributions of the six players in the previous round and the total amount contributed by each player up to this round (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s016">S16 Fig</xref>). If the goal was reached at the end of the game, all the participants kept the money that they had not contributed in the form of a gift card. The 120 &#x020ac; collected in the pot will be used once the research is published in organizing an event that includes an action against climate change (the action will consist in planting trees in a forest in Barcelona within the Day of the Tree event organized by an NGO [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]) and where there will be a dissemination of the current results. Otherwise, if the common fund did not reach 120 &#x020ac; at the end of the game, we did use the contribution to take any action against climate change and the participants only kept the remaining money with a probability of 10%.</p><sec id="sec003"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Numerical data representing payoff and contributions are expressed as mean&#x000b1;SE with a 95% CI. The sociodemographic (age and effect of minors), as well as earnings and time of decision-making are expressed as average (SD) and in the respective figures as standard error of the mean (95% CI). To control for potential sociodemographic data that could have an influence over the participant&#x02019;s responses we used GLMM [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] with sex, age, education and the 2- and 3-way interaction between sex, age, education, followed by linear regression post test to establish the direction of the causality found at the educational level. Comparisons between average contribution and qualitative responses to question 3 (reaching the threshold) were conducted with non-parametric Chi Square. To explore how attitudes towards proportionality affected contributions, we sorted contributions according to the binomial response in question 7 (group 1 against group 2) and used non-parametric test for independent samples (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) for comparison. To mesure the differences among minors and adults in terms of contributions (both group and individual), we conducted Welch two sample t-test. Finally, to measure the robustness and stability of a given cluster we use consensus cluster metrics as item-consensus and cluster-consensus [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec004"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec005"><title>The collective risk dilemma game</title><p>The original collective-risk dilemma [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] introduced groups of six people where each person receives an initial capital (40 &#x020ac;) and the common goal of the group is to collect 120 &#x020ac; that will be invested in mitigating climate change (by publishing an ad in a national newspaper). The game consists of 10 rounds, and at every round each subject decides how much she contributes to the common fund (0 &#x020ac;, 2 &#x020ac;, or 4 &#x020ac;). If the goal is reached at (or before) the end of the game, all participants keep the money that they have not contributed. Otherwise, the participants only keep the remaining money with a probability which in [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] was 90%, 50%, or 10% (equivalently, a climatic catastrophe occurred with probability 10%, 50%, or 90%). In addition, in this case no money goes to climate change mitigation. The main result was that most groups did not reach the goal, and even in the worst case scenario (catastrophe probability 90%) only about half of the groups avoided climate change. We reproduced the original dilemma with the worst case scenario and the exact same configuration as our baseline treatment, and we carried out sessions with wealth heterogeneity for comparison with the homogeneous one.</p><p>To introduce inequality, we distributed six different windfall starting capitals (20 &#x020ac;, 30 &#x020ac;, 40 &#x020ac;, 40 &#x020ac;, 50 &#x020ac;, and 60 &#x020ac;) randomly amongst the participants. In half of the games the participants could invest 0 &#x020ac;, 2 &#x020ac;, or 4 &#x020ac; per round as in the above setup, while in the other half of the games we allowed them more flexible choices, namely 0 &#x020ac;, 1 &#x020ac;, 2 &#x020ac;, 3 &#x020ac;, and 4 &#x020ac; per round (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s022">S1 File</xref> Section 1.2). In all cases we informed the participants that in case they reached the goal of 120 &#x020ac;, the collected money would be used for a reforestation action by planting trees in a nearby park with the help of an NGO organisation [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Finally, after the experiment, we asked our subjects to answer a questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s022">S1 File</xref> Section 1.8) to have an individual assessment of climate change awareness and predisposition to collaborate in common actions that could be further correlated with the individual&#x02019;s contributions.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Equilibria and fair distribution</title><p>In our heterogeneous version of the collective-risk dilemma, there are very many Nash equilibria [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], which make claiming that particular behavior should be expected very difficult. Indeed, in the homogeneous case, the number of equilibria can be refined by imposing symmetry (meaning that all subjects, being equal, should choose the same contribution and, therefore, obtain the same payoff). Then, two equilibria are left, with individuals either contributing nothing or contributing exactly 20 &#x020ac;. Of course, these equilibria refer only to accumulated contribution along the game; considering the different sequences of investments in the 10 rounds recovers the multiplicity of equilibria and we will not consider them.</p><p>In our unequal setup we have 5 types of players (there are two endowed with 40 &#x020ac;) and the symmetry refinement no longer holds. Subjects contributing nothing is still a Nash equilibrium that leads to expected gains of 10% of every subject&#x02019;s endowment. It is then easy to show that any combination of individual total investments that adds up to exactly 120 &#x020ac; such that every player makes more money than in the &#x0201c;contribute nothing&#x0201d; case is also an equilibrium. Therefore, there is not a clear theoretical prediction about what should happen in our heterogeneous version of the game.</p><p>While in the equal case in which the fair share behaviour was given by equal contribution and equal payoff (50% of the endowment in both cases), the asymmetric capital distribution in the unequal scenario requires three different concepts of fairness based on the same ideas. The first one refers to the equal payoff, &#x0201c;payoff fairness&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001">Fig 1b</xref>); the second one considers the criterion of equal contribution, &#x0201c;contribution fairness&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001">Fig 1a</xref>); and, finally we also analyze a &#x0201c;relative fairness&#x0201d; based on contributing half of the endowment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001">Fig 1c</xref>). The definitions of these quantifications of fairness are as follows: &#x0201c;payoff fairness&#x0201d; considers as fair behaviour the one in which each participant contributes an amount resulting in the same final payoff for all (i.e. 20 &#x020ac;). This means that participants receiving an endowment of 20 &#x020ac; should contribute 0 &#x020ac;, participants with an endowment of 30 &#x020ac; should contribute 10 &#x020ac;, and so on. &#x0201c;Contribution fairness&#x0201d; defines as fair an equal contribution (20 &#x020ac;) of each participant independently of the endowment. Finally, &#x0201c;relative fairness&#x0201d; considers as fair a 50% contribution of every subject&#x02019;s initial endowment (i.e. 10 &#x020ac; for participants starting with 20 &#x020ac;, 15 &#x020ac; for participants starting with 30 &#x020ac;, and so on).</p><fig id="pone.0204369.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204369.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Comparison between the expected payoff of the three types of fairness versus the observed experimental payoff for each endowment in both equal and unequal treatments.</title><p><bold>a. Contribution fairness</bold>: in this case fairness is defined by equal contributions, where each participant is expected to contribute 1/6 of the common pot independently of their initial endowment. This definition yields particularly negative results for the most vulnerable participants, those that start with 20 &#x020ac;, who do not get any reward at all. We observe that in this case these participants prefer to keep part of their endowment so they have a chance to earn something. On the other hand, the rest of the groups contribute above the fair 20 &#x020ac; contribution. <bold>b. Payoff fairness</bold>: in this case fairness is defined by equal payoffs, where each participant is expected to receive the same payoff (20 &#x020ac;) independently of their initial endowment. This fairness forces the participants to end up with the same reward, that entails an increase of the experimental payoff differences. <bold>c. Relative fairness</bold>: in this third case we define fairness when all participants contribute half of their initial endowment, therefore, in this definition we expect to observe the same inequalities as before at the end of the game. Instead, we observe that in our experiments the inequality between the richest and the poorest increase.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0204369.g001"/></fig><p>Among these possibilities, we decided to take the &#x0201c;relative fairness&#x0201d; as the main reference for the discussion of our results, which is the most representative of the inequalities generated by the participation in the game. If the participants contribute following &#x0201c;payoff fairness&#x0201d;, they start from a position of inequality (participants endowments from 20 &#x020ac; to 60 &#x020ac;) and once the game finishes their payoff is the same for all of them (20 &#x020ac;), breaking and unbalancing the initial inequalities due to the participation in the game. On the other hand, &#x0201c;contribution fairness&#x0201d; does not consider endowments at all, and therefore the initial inequality. However, in the case of &#x0201c;relative fairness&#x0201d;, after participating in the game the subjects maintain the same inequality distribution they started with. Therefore, we believe that this definition allows us to analyze the impact of the collective action in a more equitable and proportional way.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Collective climate action</title><p>In all games played in our experiment, the participants reached the goal irrespective of the initial endowments being equal or unequal.

An increase in groups reaching the target has been observed in other similar studies carried out later [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The evolution of the games also differ from previous experiments (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g002">Fig 2</xref>): In all the treatments in our experiment, the sum of money accumulated at the end of each round is always above the fair contribution (12 &#x020ac; per round), that is, participants contribute much more in the initial rounds, making the group reach the goal faster, and then they stop contributing at the end once the goal has been secured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s002">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s005">S5</xref> Figs). In contrast, the original results in [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] showed contributions below the fair one until the end of the game, and those groups that reached the goal did it by increasing their contributions in the last rounds.</p><fig id="pone.0204369.g002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204369.g002</object-id><label>Fig 2</label><caption><title>Average contribution to the common fund per round in the climate game for both, equal and unequal treatments.</title><p>The equal treatment consists of 24 valid games in which all players are endowed with 40 &#x020ac;, and the unequal treatment consists of 26 valid games where the initial endowments of 20 &#x020ac;, 30 &#x020ac;, 40 &#x020ac;, 40 &#x020ac;, 50 &#x020ac;, and 60 &#x020ac; are randomly assigned to the players.

<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g003">Fig 3</xref> presents the average amount of capital contributed as a function of the initial capital of the participants. We observe that, in terms of absolute contribution, the subjects with high endowments, 50 &#x020ac; and 60 &#x020ac;, are the ones that contribute the most, 2.6 &#x000b1; 0.13 &#x020ac; and 2.8 &#x000b1; 0.12 &#x020ac; per round respectively (mean&#x000b1;SE). Participants with low-endowments, 20 &#x020ac; and 30 &#x020ac;, contribute the least,1.4 &#x000b1; 0.11 &#x020ac; and 2 &#x000b1; 0.15 &#x020ac; respectively. However, this comparison is not the best for interpreting the obtained results, since the initial capital of the poorest players only allows them to contribute a maximum of 2 &#x020ac; per round (earning 0 at the end). Therefore, the comparison makes more sense in terms of the percentage of capital contributed relative to their total capital, which in turn allows to discuss the results using the &#x0201c;relative fairness&#x0201d; as reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Strikingly, we observe that the most affluent (endowments of 60 &#x020ac;) are the ones that contribute proportionally less, with around 46.6% of their initial capital, while the poorest (starting with 20 &#x020ac;) contribute around 71.4% of their initial capital which shows their vulnerability when facing the collective risk dilemma. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows very clearly the stark contrast between the two visions. To put this result further in context, we notice that the maximum contribution from participants with an endowment of 20 &#x020ac; (2 &#x020ac; per round) implies an effort of 2 times the fair contribution, whereas for participants with an endowment of 60 &#x020ac;, the effort of contributing 2 &#x020ac; per round is 0.66 times the fair contribution. Therefore, in that case, contributing 2 &#x020ac; have unequal impacts in the capital of subjects: the poorest participants, contributing 1.4 &#x020ac; on average, make a larger effort than wealthy participants contributing 2.8 &#x020ac;, which is even below their fair share of the threshold.</p><fig id="pone.0204369.g003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204369.g003</object-id><label>Fig 3</label><caption><p><bold>a.

This is motivated by the intuition that subjects choose their contributions as a function of their endowment but also taking into account the current situation and whether the goal is closer or farther. In turn, we can monitor how the contributions differ depending on the stage of the game where they are (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s007">S7</xref> Figs).

Looking at the results of the clustering we immediately identify two different types of behaviors, a group of generous participants (cluster 1) that contribute above the fair contribution, and a group of more greedy participants that contribute around the fair contribution at the beginning of the game and decrease their contribution as they approach the end of the game (but before reaching the goal).</p><fig id="pone.0204369.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0204369.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><p><bold>a.

Nevertheless, in this case emerge a minority group (7.45%) of hyper-generous individuals (cluster 1) that contributes far beyond what we are considering fair. And, again, in cluster 2 the subjects contribute on average more than the fair contribution, whereas in cluster 3 the average contributions are around the fair value at the beginning, but as the game approaches the end they decrease below the fair amount. We also observe in this treatment that subjects of the hyper-generous group increase their contributions significantly after the initial rounds, while the rest of the groups maintain or decrease their contribution as the game advances.</p><p>In this latter framework, participants have different initial endowments. Thus, it is interesting to check how these subjects are distributed in each of the three groups based on their relative contribution. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g005">Fig 5d</xref> shows that subjects with fewer resources (20 &#x020ac;-30 &#x020ac;) than the rest are concentrated in the generous clusters (1 and 2). In fact, the cluster 1 (the hyper-generous group) is formed exclusively by subjects with low endowments. On the other hand, the third cluster is mainly composed by subjects with mid and high endowments. This means that the majority of low endowed participants, 73.07% (20 &#x020ac;) and 62.96% (30 &#x020ac;) contributed above the fair threshold, different from the subjects with high endowments, where only 51.85% (50 &#x020ac;) and 18.51% (60 &#x020ac;) contributed a fair amount. Interestingly, the comparison of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g005">Fig 5b and 5d</xref> shows that subjects with mid endowments (40 &#x020ac;-50 &#x020ac;) distributed among the two clusters not very differently from the equal treatment. Therefore, the richest participants were those who diverged from that distribution.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Effect of awareness about climate change</title><p>All groups reached the goal. Although climate awareness has proven to have an effect on individual responses [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the majority of our sample (N = 294, 91.3%) failed basic questions about climate change concepts, in a questionnaire that included basic questions about the greenhouse effect, carbon footprint, or the Kyoto Protocol (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s022">S1 File</xref> Section 1.8). We stress that this is so even if the experiment was done the week following the COP21 summit in Paris, which had led us to expect much more familiarity of our subjects with climate change. This result allows us to exclude that more literacy and more public outreach efforts on climate change are the reasons for the participants reaching the goal in all cases.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>Effect of socio-demographics and beliefs</title><p>No significant differences were observed in terms of age or gender of the participants. However, educational level was a factor that significantly affected the average contribution (GLMM, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 3.811, df = 1, p = .006). Subjects with lower education level were predicted to make higher contributions in equal conditions (F(1,156) = 7.219, p&#x0003c;.05). In addition, before starting the game a third part of the sample (N = 112, 34.8%) expected to arrive to the common goal. Harboring this previous expectation did not have an influence over their average contribution (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> = 6.005, df = 3, p = .111).</p><p>Importantly, we detect some inconsistencies between belief and behavior. The majority of the sample (around 87%) claimed that their contributions should not depend on the co-participant&#x02019;s contribution, but the existence of different clusters shows that they did take the accumulated capital into account to decide their next contribution. In addition, more than half of the participants (N = 214, 66%) defended the idea of relative fairness (e.g. agreed with the statement &#x0201c;Contributions should be proportional to the initial capital so that players with more capital should contribute more to the pool&#x0201d;). In contrast, those who firmly agreed with proportionality in the unequal conditions contributed less than those who did not strongly support that (Z = -2.653, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; .05), especially when their initial endowment was high. For example, the participants with a starting capital of 60 &#x020ac; that adhered to &#x0201c;proportionate contributions&#x0201d; contributed an average of 2.6 &#x020ac; per round, whereas those with the same initial endowment who did not firmly claim that contributed 3.05 &#x020ac; per round.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Effect of generosity on emergence of inequality</title><p>Finally, we measured what the impact of this selfless behaviour among the poorest participants on the global inequality was. Gini Coeficcient, apart from a standard way to calculate inequality levels in economics, is completely appropriate here since general behaviour consisting on contributing the fair share would leave the value of Gini Coefficient constant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s013">S13 Fig</xref>). Thus, in the equal treatment the Gini Coefficient increases from 0 (initial distribution) to 0.1806 at the end of the experiment, whereas in the unequal treatment increases from 0.1812 to 0.3483.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec013"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our experimental results allow us to conclude that inequalities may lead to unexpected problems in climate change mitigation, mostly related to environmental justice. Interestingly, knowledge about climate change facts did not play a relevant role in the average contributions to the common fund. This might indicate that policies mainly addressed to increase climate change awareness might not be the most efficient solution to foster cooperation, and suggests that emphasizing a correct interpretation of the perceived effects might be more useful in this regard.</p><p>Even if all groups avoided the climatic catastrophe, our work shows that other potentially serious issues may arise in the process. A particularly important one is that disadvantaged individuals are contributing much more than a fair share of the mitigation, and that the richest ones are contributing less. It is telling that all hyper-generous behavior is observed in the two poorest types of individuals, while a large majority of those endowed with the largest amount behaved selfishly (irrespective of what they claim to believe about fair contributions, as we have seen). It thus appears that, contrary to the expectations of the poor exploiting the rich in a public goods context, here we found the opposite situation. This result has also been pointed out in other studies with even higher unequality [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], where they also observe a selfish behavior of the richest participants.</p><p>At this point, it is important to note that these experiments were done in a short period of time and therefore they do not inform about long-term behavior. It would be possible that the fact that the poor contributed more for a long time might eventually lead them to stop doing so, thus jeopardizing the collective goal. The decisions we observed in the experiment did not allow us to learn about the behavior of the richest players in that case, i.e., whether or not they would jump in to solve the problem (although the results in [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] suggest that this could be the case).</p><p>Finally, it is important to discuss the different behaviors observed in the collectives we have worked with. Education does not help here: less educated-less favored participants contributed more to the collective goal than more educated-more favored ones. This could indicate that there is an underlying cultural assumption of sacrifice of the most disadvantaged people (related to their vulnerability): in a situation where the poorest are the ones who will face the worst consequences, more advantaged participants may feel inclined to contribute less to solving the problem. Particularly alarming is the fact that, in the group of the richest participants, about 80% behaved in a selfish manner. As this is the group that had the largest means to help to mitigate climate change, their fault to contribute may jeopardize the whole society, which calls for specific actions to work with this segment of the population while providing additional policies to protect more disadvantaged groups or collectives.</p><p>To suggest new ways to initiate a collective climate action according to our findings, firstly it is worth noting some differences of our study with a real world situation. For example, similar to [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], our participants gathered information about their co-participants&#x02019; responses whereas particular information from others (i.e. foreign countries or other communities sharing space in a city) may not be available, reliable, or complete in the real world. Therefore, to foster cooperation, future policies may benefit from making data and contributions public and transparent. Moreover, our experimental subjects held unambiguous responsibility over their actions whereas climate change is a global problem with diffuse shared duties. In this sense we have proven that a good general education is not the remedy to avoid inequality in contribution, but promoting collective rather than parochial attitudes, which has proven to be one factor underlying cooperation [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], may be a better solution to make individuals assume their responsibilities. Finally, we used an economic paradigm to establish a concrete threshold to be reached so that our subjects received the economic consequences directly and immediately once the game was over, however the Nature&#x02019;s threshold is more uncertain [<xref rid="pone.0204369.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and consequences can spread out over generations. Monetizing Nature by establishing concrete thresholds to be reached in a particular time period and rewarding the population if they enact some actions (i.e. return taxes if substituting diesel oil cars with electric vehicles or if groups of neighbors install and maintain a rooftop garden on their own buildings) may work to address people towards a general cooperation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec014"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204369.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Sociodemographic.</title><p>Distribution of subjects in the experiment by age and gender.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0204369.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0204369.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Investment choices at the beginning and end of the game.</title><p>Density of investment selections, mean and standard error of the mean (95% CI), in the first five rounds and the last five rounds. a.
