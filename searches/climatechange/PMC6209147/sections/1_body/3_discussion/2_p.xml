<p class="p">Even if all groups avoided the climatic catastrophe, our work shows that other potentially serious issues may arise in the process. A particularly important one is that disadvantaged individuals are contributing much more than a fair share of the mitigation, and that the richest ones are contributing less. It is telling that all hyper-generous behavior is observed in the two poorest types of individuals, while a large majority of those endowed with the largest amount behaved selfishly (irrespective of what they claim to believe about fair contributions, as we have seen). It thus appears that, contrary to the expectations of the poor exploiting the rich in a public goods context, here we found the opposite situation. This result has also been pointed out in other studies with even higher unequality [
