Education does not help here: less educated-less favored participants contributed more to the collective goal than more educated-more favored ones. This could indicate that there is an underlying cultural assumption of sacrifice of the most disadvantaged people (related to their vulnerability): in a situation where the poorest are the ones who will face the worst consequences, more advantaged participants may feel inclined to contribute less to solving the problem. Particularly alarming is the fact that, in the group of the richest participants, about 80% behaved in a selfish manner. As this is the group that had the largest means to help to mitigate climate change, their fault to contribute may jeopardize the whole society, which calls for specific actions to work with this segment of the population while providing additional policies to protect more disadvantaged groups or collectives.</p>
