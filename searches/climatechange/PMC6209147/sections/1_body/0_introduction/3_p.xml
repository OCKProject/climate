<p class="p">Resource heterogeneity and environmental justice can be very suitably framed within the collective-risk dilemma experimental setup introduced by Milinski 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. a decade ago [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In this framework, to be described in detail below, groups of people have to work together to reach a common goal by making contributions from an initial endowment. If the goal is reached, every individual receives the part of the money not contributed. If not, a catastrophe occurs with certain probability, and all participants lose all the money they had kept. While many experimental and theoretical studies have considered different aspects of climate change within this framework [

 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], the issue of heterogeneity has only been considered in three experiments framed in the climate change issue. Tavoni et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] included inequality by separating the participants into two groups with different starting endowments, and found that the common goal was less likely to be reached. However, when they allowed participants to communicate their intentions, the probability of reaching the target goal increased again, similarly to conditional cooperation in public goods games [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. On the other hand, Milinski 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] observed that when they included rich and poor subjects, rich ones substituted for missing contributions by the poor provided intermediate climate targets, however, despite this increase in the contributions of the rich, the final target was reached less often than the intermediate target. Finally, Burton-Chellew and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] proposed a game with four conditions varying the initial endowments and/or the risk of a catastrophic climate event. They found that inequality in both endowments and risk decreased cooperation, that is to say, selfishness emerged when rich were less at risk. However, some rich players were still reluctant to cooperate when they suffered the higher risk. It seems that climate change awareness could have mediated their responses, since it was found to be proportional with individual contributions. Outside of the climate change framing, studies on the role of heterogeneous endowments in public goods games are not conclusive, with different experiments leading to different results [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Therefore, new studies are needed to understand the influence of heterogeneity in threshold public goods games.
