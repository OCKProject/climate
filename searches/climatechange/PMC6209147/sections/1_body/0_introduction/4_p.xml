<p class="p">Here, we extend the knowledge on the effects of resource heterogeneity in collective dilemmas in two main directions. First, we include broader capital distributions, thus representing more closely the diversity in resource availability among the members of a given collective public goods game, e.g., between different countries worldwide or inhabitants in a given urban context. Second, and most importantly, we go beyond aggregate results to analyze the behavior of individuals by means of agnostic classification tools that allow us to identify differences between the behavior of subjects with the same resources. We complement this analysis with a questionnaire probing into the subjectsâ€™ knowledge of the climate change crisis and the influence of such knowledge in their actions. Therefore, we provide a much more complete picture of the influence of inequality that encompasses both the collective (reaching the common goal) and the individual (how different individuals behave under different circumstances) visions of the problem. Such a two-level approach is the best option in order to identify how agents react to resource heterogeneity and what actions must be taken to promote environmental justice. As we show below, our findings allow to hint directions for policy measures targeted to specific collectives.</p>
