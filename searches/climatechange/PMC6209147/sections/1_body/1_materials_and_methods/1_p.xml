<p class="p">The experiment was conducted following the lab-in-the-field experiment guidelines used in [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], which helped us recruiting participants from a general audience by using opportunistic recruitment, opposed to the typical samples of university undergraduate students. All participants in the experiment signed an informed consent to participate and no association was ever made between their real names and the results, in agreement with the Spanish Law for Personal Data Protection. This procedure was approved by the Ethics Committee of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, and all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. The experiment was conducted in different sessions in the DAU fair in Barcelona during two days (December 12-13, 2015) by means of the Citizen Social Lab platform developed ad hoc for this experiment [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The total number of games was 54, the number of participants in our experiment was 324 subjects, adding up to a total of 3240 game decisions collected. If some participant was non-responsive, the experimental platform took over and make the contribution randomly for her; in that case the data was labeled and the subject’s decisions were discarded in the analysis. The total number of subjects with uncorrupted decisions are 320 (134 women, 41.8%) leading to a total number of valid decisions of 3200. The age ranged from 11 to 73 years, 32.15 (13.04) on average (SD), there are no significant differences between the behaviour of minors (&lt; 18) and adults at the level of individual contribution, nor between games in which there are minors and adults coexisting and in which there are only adults (

Almost half of the sample was graduated (48%), whereas the other half was equally distributed between different educational levels (i.e. professional training (16%), elementary (11%), middle (11%) and high school (12%). Most of the participants were naïve to social experiments (N = 279, 86%). Average (SD) earnings were 18.21 € (8.8) (
