<p class="p">Numerical data representing payoff and contributions are expressed as mean±SE with a 95% CI. The sociodemographic (age and effect of minors), as well as earnings and time of decision-making are expressed as average (SD) and in the respective figures as standard error of the mean (95% CI). To control for potential sociodemographic data that could have an influence over the participant’s responses we used GLMM [

Comparisons between average contribution and qualitative responses to question 3 (reaching the threshold) were conducted with non-parametric Chi Square. To explore how attitudes towards proportionality affected contributions, we sorted contributions according to the binomial response in question 7 (group 1 against group 2) and used non-parametric test for independent samples (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test) for comparison. To mesure the differences among minors and adults in terms of contributions (both group and individual), we conducted Welch two sample t-test. Finally, to measure the robustness and stability of a given cluster we use consensus cluster metrics as item-consensus and cluster-consensus [
