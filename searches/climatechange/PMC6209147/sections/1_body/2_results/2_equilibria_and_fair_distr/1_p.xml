<p class="p">In our heterogeneous version of the collective-risk dilemma, there are very many Nash equilibria [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], which make claiming that particular behavior should be expected very difficult. Indeed, in the homogeneous case, the number of equilibria can be refined by imposing symmetry (meaning that all subjects, being equal, should choose the same contribution and, therefore, obtain the same payoff). Then, two equilibria are left, with individuals either contributing nothing or contributing exactly 20 â‚¬. Of course, these equilibria refer only to accumulated contribution along the game; considering the different sequences of investments in the 10 rounds recovers the multiplicity of equilibria and we will not consider them.
