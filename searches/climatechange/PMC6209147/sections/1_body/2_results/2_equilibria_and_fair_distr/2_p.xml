<p class="p">In our unequal setup we have 5 types of players (there are two endowed with 40 €) and the symmetry refinement no longer holds. Subjects contributing nothing is still a Nash equilibrium that leads to expected gains of 10% of every subject’s endowment. It is then easy to show that any combination of individual total investments that adds up to exactly 120 € such that every player makes more money than in the “contribute nothing” case is also an equilibrium. Therefore, there is not a clear theoretical prediction about what should happen in our heterogeneous version of the game.</p>
