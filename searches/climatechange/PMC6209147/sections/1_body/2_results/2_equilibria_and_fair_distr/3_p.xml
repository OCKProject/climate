<p class="p">While in the equal case in which the fair share behaviour was given by equal contribution and equal payoff (50% of the endowment in both cases), the asymmetric capital distribution in the unequal scenario requires three different concepts of fairness based on the same ideas. The first one refers to the equal payoff, “payoff fairness” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001" class="xref">Fig 1b</xref>); the second one considers the criterion of equal contribution, “contribution fairness” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001" class="xref">Fig 1a</xref>); and, finally we also analyze a “relative fairness” based on contributing half of the endowment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g001" class="xref">Fig 1c</xref>). The definitions of these quantifications of fairness are as follows: “payoff fairness” considers as fair behaviour the one in which each participant contributes an amount resulting in the same final payoff for all (i.e. 20 €). This means that participants receiving an endowment of 20 € should contribute 0 €, participants with an endowment of 30 € should contribute 10 €, and so on. “Contribution fairness” defines as fair an equal contribution (20 €) of each participant independently of the endowment. Finally, “relative fairness” considers as fair a 50% contribution of every subject’s initial endowment (i.e. 10 € for participants starting with 20 €, 15 € for participants starting with 30 €, and so on).
