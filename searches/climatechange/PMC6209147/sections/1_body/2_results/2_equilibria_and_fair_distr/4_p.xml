<p class="p">Among these possibilities, we decided to take the “relative fairness” as the main reference for the discussion of our results, which is the most representative of the inequalities generated by the participation in the game. If the participants contribute following “payoff fairness”, they start from a position of inequality (participants endowments from 20 € to 60 €) and once the game finishes their payoff is the same for all of them (20 €), breaking and unbalancing the initial inequalities due to the participation in the game. On the other hand, “contribution fairness” does not consider endowments at all, and therefore the initial inequality. However, in the case of “relative fairness”, after participating in the game the subjects maintain the same inequality distribution they started with. Therefore, we believe that this definition allows us to analyze the impact of the collective action in a more equitable and proportional way.</p>
