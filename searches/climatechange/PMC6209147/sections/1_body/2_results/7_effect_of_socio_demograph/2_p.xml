<p class="p">Importantly, we detect some inconsistencies between belief and behavior. The majority of the sample (around 87%) claimed that their contributions should not depend on the co-participant’s contribution, but the existence of different clusters shows that they did take the accumulated capital into account to decide their next contribution. In addition, more than half of the participants (N = 214, 66%) defended the idea of relative fairness (e.g. agreed with the statement “Contributions should be proportional to the initial capital so that players with more capital should contribute more to the pool”). In contrast, those who firmly agreed with proportionality in the unequal conditions contributed less than those who did not strongly support that (Z = -2.653, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05), especially when their initial endowment was high. For example, the participants with a starting capital of 60 € that adhered to “proportionate contributions” contributed an average of 2.6 € per round, whereas those with the same initial endowment who did not firmly claim that contributed 3.05 € per round.
