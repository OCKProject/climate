<p class="p">In all games played in our experiment, the participants reached the goal irrespective of the initial endowments being equal or unequal. In the former case, our result has to be compared with only 50% success rate for the groups in [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>): In all the treatments in our experiment, the sum of money accumulated at the end of each round is always above the fair contribution (12 â‚¬ per round), that is, participants contribute much more in the initial rounds, making the group reach the goal faster, and then they stop contributing at the end once the goal has been secured (

 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] showed contributions below the fair one until the end of the game, and those groups that reached the goal did it by increasing their contributions in the last rounds.
