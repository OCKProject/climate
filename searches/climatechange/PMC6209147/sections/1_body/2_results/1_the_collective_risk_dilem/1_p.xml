<p class="p">The original collective-risk dilemma [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] introduced groups of six people where each person receives an initial capital (40 €) and the common goal of the group is to collect 120 € that will be invested in mitigating climate change (by publishing an ad in a national newspaper). The game consists of 10 rounds, and at every round each subject decides how much she contributes to the common fund (0 €, 2 €, or 4 €). If the goal is reached at (or before) the end of the game, all participants keep the money that they have not contributed. Otherwise, the participants only keep the remaining money with a probability which in [
 <xref rid="pone.0204369.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] was 90%, 50%, or 10% (equivalently, a climatic catastrophe occurred with probability 10%, 50%, or 90%). In addition, in this case no money goes to climate change mitigation. The main result was that most groups did not reach the goal, and even in the worst case scenario (catastrophe probability 90%) only about half of the groups avoided climate change. We reproduced the original dilemma with the worst case scenario and the exact same configuration as our baseline treatment, and we carried out sessions with wealth heterogeneity for comparison with the homogeneous one.
