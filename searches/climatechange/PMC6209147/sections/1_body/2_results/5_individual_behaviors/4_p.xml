<p class="p">In this latter framework, participants have different initial endowments. Thus, it is interesting to check how these subjects are distributed in each of the three groups based on their relative contribution. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g005" class="xref">Fig 5d</xref> shows that subjects with fewer resources (20 €-30 €) than the rest are concentrated in the generous clusters (1 and 2). In fact, the cluster 1 (the hyper-generous group) is formed exclusively by subjects with low endowments. On the other hand, the third cluster is mainly composed by subjects with mid and high endowments. This means that the majority of low endowed participants, 73.07% (20 €) and 62.96% (30 €) contributed above the fair threshold, different from the subjects with high endowments, where only 51.85% (50 €) and 18.51% (60 €) contributed a fair amount. Interestingly, the comparison of
