 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g005" class="xref">Fig 5a and 5b</xref> we present the results of the clustering of the participants of the homogeneous treatment, with equal capital distribution. In this scenario the optimal number of groups identified is two. Looking at the results of the clustering we immediately identify two different types of behaviors, a group of generous participants (cluster 1) that contribute above the fair contribution, and a group of more greedy participants that contribute around the fair contribution at the beginning of the game and decrease their contribution as they approach the end of the game (but before reaching the goal).
