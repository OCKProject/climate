 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g005" class="xref">Fig 5c and 5d</xref> show that the optimal division of the participants is into three groups, being clusters 2 and 3 those gathering the majority of subjects (92.55%), similarly to the equal treatment. Nevertheless, in this case emerge a minority group (7.45%) of hyper-generous individuals (cluster 1) that contributes far beyond what we are considering fair. And, again, in cluster 2 the subjects contribute on average more than the fair contribution, whereas in cluster 3 the average contributions are around the fair value at the beginning, but as the game approaches the end they decrease below the fair amount. We also observe in this treatment that subjects of the hyper-generous group increase their contributions significantly after the initial rounds, while the rest of the groups maintain or decrease their contribution as the game advances.
