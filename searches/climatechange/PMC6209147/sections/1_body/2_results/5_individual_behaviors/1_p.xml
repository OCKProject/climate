<p class="p">Once we have looked at the average evolution of the different groups, we focus on the individual behavior and study whether participants with the same starting capital behave similarly. We characterize the set of decisions taken by each participant with a vector, grouping decisions by the capital on the common fund at the beginning of the round (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204369.s022" class="xref">S1 File</xref> Section 1.3 for a more detailed explanation). This is motivated by the intuition that subjects choose their contributions as a function of their endowment but also taking into account the current situation and whether the goal is closer or farther. In turn, we can monitor how the contributions differ depending on the stage of the game where they are (
