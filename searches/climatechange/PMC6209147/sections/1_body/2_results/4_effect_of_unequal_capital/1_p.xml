 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> presents the average amount of capital contributed as a function of the initial capital of the participants. We observe that, in terms of absolute contribution, the subjects with high endowments, 50 € and 60 €, are the ones that contribute the most, 2.6 ± 0.13 € and 2.8 ± 0.12 € per round respectively (mean±SE). Participants with low-endowments, 20 € and 30 €, contribute the least,1.4 ± 0.11 € and 2 ± 0.15 € respectively. However, this comparison is not the best for interpreting the obtained results, since the initial capital of the poorest players only allows them to contribute a maximum of 2 € per round (earning 0 at the end). Therefore, the comparison makes more sense in terms of the percentage of capital contributed relative to their total capital, which in turn allows to discuss the results using the “relative fairness” as reference (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Strikingly, we observe that the most affluent (endowments of 60 €) are the ones that contribute proportionally less, with around 46.6% of their initial capital, while the poorest (starting with 20 €) contribute around 71.4% of their initial capital which shows their vulnerability when facing the collective risk dilemma. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204369.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> shows very clearly the stark contrast between the two visions. To put this result further in context, we notice that the maximum contribution from participants with an endowment of 20 € (2 € per round) implies an effort of 2 times the fair contribution, whereas for participants with an endowment of 60 €, the effort of contributing 2 € per round is 0.66 times the fair contribution. Therefore, in that case, contributing 2 € have unequal impacts in the capital of subjects: the poorest participants, contributing 1.4 € on average, make a larger effort than wealthy participants contributing 2.8 €, which is even below their fair share of the threshold.
