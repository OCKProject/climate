  <title class="title">Average contribution to the common fund per round in the climate game for both, equal and unequal treatments.</title>
  <p class="p">The equal treatment consists of 24 valid games in which all players are endowed with 40 €, and the unequal treatment consists of 26 valid games where the initial endowments of 20 €, 30 €, 40 €, 40 €, 50 €, and 60 € are randomly assigned to the players. In both treatments we observe that the accumulated contribution in all the rounds of all the games is almost always above the expected fair contribution per round (dotted line).</p>
