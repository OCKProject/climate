  <title class="title">Average payoff for each of the initial endowment groups for the unequal (red) and equal (blue) treatments.</title>
  <p class="p">Panel a shows the average payoff (95% CI) while panel b shows the values normalized following the definition of “relative fairness”, where each participant is expected to contribute half of their initial capital. We observe that those who have more resources get a higher normalized payoff, and in the 60 € group it is even above the expected fair. Instead, the most vulnerable (20 € and 30 €) get a much lower payoff than the fair. There are significant differences between them and the rest of participants with higher endowments (
