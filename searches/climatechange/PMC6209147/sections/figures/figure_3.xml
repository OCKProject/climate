   <bold class="bold">a. Average (95% CI) capital contributed according to the participants’ endowments in both treatments equal and unequal</bold>. Note that participants starting with 20 € and 30 € can only reach a maximum average contribution per round of 2 € and 3 € respectively. 
   <bold class="bold">b. Average (95% CI) proportion of capital contributed according to the participants’ endowments in both treatments equal and unequal</bold>. Dotted line represents the fair contribution, which we have defined as contributing 50% of the initial capital. The effort to contribute is different depending on the endowments, so dots represent the maximum investment that each group can reach. Participants with endowments of 50 € and 60 € always keep a proportion of capital as savings even if they contribute the maximum amount of 4 € per round.
