<p class="p">Our goal was to evaluate the self-perceptions of knowledge on climate change among various socio-demographic groups, particularly women and minorities. We tested whether the following: age, education, gender, experience with disaster and drought, race, and an interaction between gender and education, predicted the respondentâ€™s self-perceived level of climate change knowledge. Because women may underestimate their comprehension of climate science [

We also expected that increasing educational attainment would further reduce the level of knowledge perceived by women, since increasing education may reduce confidence in knowledge among women [

Similarly, we hypothesized that minority respondents would self-report less knowledge on climate change than white respondents because previous research suggests racial minorities experience negative self-perceptions of intelligence [
