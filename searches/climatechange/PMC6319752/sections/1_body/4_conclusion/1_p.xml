<p class="p">This study enhances our understanding of the gender gap previously identified in the climate change knowledge perceptions literature [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Our results illustrate that the negative perceptions of climate change knowledge in women are correlated with higher educational attainment, and at lower levels of education, women actually self-report more knowledge than men. Although further research is required, previous studies find minorities have lower levels of assessed climate change knowledge [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and a lack of psycho-social support—which can lead to less engagement with scientific topics [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Together with our findings, these studies may indicate the need for educational and psychological intervention on behalf of minorities in order to increase climate change literacy and perceptions of intelligence. A lack of confidence in one’s own knowledge can make educational efforts more effective by encouraging further knowledge seeking [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], but a downside may emerge if highly educated women and minorities avoid starting conversations with others about climate change because they do not believe they understand the issue well enough. Encouraging knowledge-seeking behavior among women and minorities–who are less skeptical about climate change than white men [
