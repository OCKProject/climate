To promote a representative sample of demographic groups, the sample locations were evenly stratified across five social vulnerability classes, ranging from high to low vulnerability, found in Cutter et al.’s 2006–10 [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] social vulnerability index (SoVI) data set.
