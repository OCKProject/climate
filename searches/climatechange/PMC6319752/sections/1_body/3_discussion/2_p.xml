<p class="p">Multiple explanations for this interaction are possible. Negative stereotypes face women regarding their academic proficiency, especially in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. These negative stereotypes can elicit a disruptive and anxious state, known as stereotype-threat [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], which can undermine academic performance and contribute to the high attrition rates of women in STEM fields [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. These stereotypes can also influence the way women and young girls are treated in classrooms; some teachers are biased against women, particularly in math and the sciences [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], a phenomenon commonly referred to as expectation bias [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. These biases can further exacerbate the negative self-perceptions of female students [

 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and become self-fulfilling prophecies, as these students are often sent on less ambitious tracks [
