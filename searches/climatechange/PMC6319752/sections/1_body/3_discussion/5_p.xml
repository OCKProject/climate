<p class="p">Cultural exclusion, expectation bias, and limited representation of minorities in STEM majors [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] likely all contributed to the low level of self-reported climate change knowledge among minority respondents. Minority groups are often culturally excluded from rigorous scientific and environmental education [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] and many attend schools in low-income urban school districts, which are largely under-funded [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Additionally, minority respondents may have self-reported lower levels of knowledge due to cultural stereotypes of intellectual ability, similar to those that plague women. For example, Steele and Aronson [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] found that black students only underperform compared to white students when they believe their intellectual ability is being tested. The biased expectations that teachers have of minority students can influence their pedagogical effectiveness, further driving the academic underperformance of minorities [
 <xref rid="pone.0210149.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Future studies should explore the drivers of low perceived climate change knowledge among minorities and compare the levels of assessed climate change knowledge of minority groups to their levels of perceived knowledge.
