<p class="p">Changes in the distributional ranges of species are among the expected outcomes of climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Several comprehensive studies report a broad prevalence of range shifts at poleward or upper range boundaries consistent with climate change predictions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Range shifts contrary to predictions may occur because organisms are responding to a different variable (related or unrelated to climate change), or because the predicted direction was wrongly established to begin with. In fact, by identifying appropriate controlling stressors, and refining how the predicted direction of change is established, recent analyses have shown that species may be tracking climate change even when distribution ranges are shifting in otherwise unexpected directions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Making sense of shifts contrary to predictions is important as it may impact the confidence level of climate change attribution, and therefore influence public opinion and policy.
