<p class="p">We used a dataset comprised of 90 individual 4-year-long temperature time series (six microhabitats on 15 shores from 37 °N to 55 °N latitude, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>) to evaluate to what extent the patterns of ecologically relevant metrics of a stressor are indeed captured by that stressor’s mean. Extreme temperature is a major stressor in most ecosystems, and especially in the rocky intertidal
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>, where animals and plants a few centimetres apart can be experiencing dramatic differences in body temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. The overall mean temperature, which is often used as a reference for estimating species distributions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, was shown to match latitude surprisingly well (R = 0.98, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>), thus reinforcing the idea of a relatively smooth, continuous gradient from warmer to colder temperatures with increasing latitudes along the European Atlantic coastline. However, with the exception of ‘winter mean’ and ‘winter 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1h,i</xref>, blue lines), all other metrics (‘summer mean’, ‘summer 95
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’, and winter and summer ‘7 day mean’, ‘daily range’, ‘microhabitat range’, ‘minimum’, ‘5
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile’ and ‘maximum’) exhibited patterns deviating substantially from that of the grand mean. These differences highlight the key role played by climatic, geomorphologic and oceanographic factors at the local level, and more importantly, show that such factors can change skewness or kurtosis of the distribution of temperatures (or even causing multimodality) without affecting the mean. For example, seasonality, which is strongest within the Bay of Biscay — shores H and I — appears not to drive the grand mean for these shores too far away from the expected value given their latitude, but results in remarkably high summer temperatures (in fact the highest recorded in the study area; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1i,j</xref>, red lines) and equally remarkably low temperatures during winter (again, the lowest within the study area; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1f,g</xref>, blue lines). In another example, upwelling, which is typically stronger around shores F and L during summer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, can be seen driving ‘summer daily range’ and ‘summer microhabitat range’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d,e</xref>, red lines), likely due to the co-occurrence of low water temperatures and high air temperatures. Again, this effect does not result in any important deviation of the grand mean from the latitudinal pattern for these shores, and would be largely missed if data at the appropriate spatial scale had not been collected. Additionally, the combination of regional factors and local context can result in surprising temperature distributions, such as seen at shore N. At this shore, all metrics were found to be lower or equal to the expected value based on latitude. However, the grand mean does not reflect the magnitude of this difference, especially considering that shore N is the coldest in the study area for some of the metrics calculated. The many patterns encapsulated within the distribution of values of a single stressor clearly indicates that the grand mean may largely misrepresent many other ecologically relevant aspects of that stressor. This is in accordance with previous studies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> and reinforces the notion that a-priori knowledge of the physiological requirements of a species and a detailed characterisation of the thermal extremes at the study area are fundamental to ascertain the real stress landscape imposed on organisms.
