<p class="p">It is well recognized that the mean is a metric that oversimplifies much of the complexity of stressors

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, and specific aspects of some stressors (e.g., minimum water temperature during winter) have been identified as playing key roles in determining biogeographic patterns
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. However, since environmental data at the appropriate temporal and spatial scales are often lacking, the patterns of many aspects of stressors remain largely uncharacterized with appropriate detail. To fill this void, general perception seems to hold that whatever spatial gradient is detected in the mean must be reflected to a large extent by all other metrics, especially for cases where the mean neatly fits preconceived assumptions. There is, however, no statistical ground supporting that view, and we argue that this misunderstanding may lead to improper estimation of what exactly is the predicted direction of range shifts of a particular species as a response to changes in the patterns of a single stressor. This effect should be especially noticeable for systems following Liebigâ€™s law of the minimum to some extent, which emphasizes the role of the scarcest resource (or, in this case, the least favourable bioclimatic variable) in determining habitat suitability at a given location and time.
