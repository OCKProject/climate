<p class="p">We conducted ten different simulations where we examined different climate and harvest related scenarios. The first simulation was based on present climate conditions where June discharge and May temperature were taken from historical values for the Buffalo River area. Using the NOAA climate station and USGS river gage described above, we calculated a mean value and standard deviations based on May temperature from the years 1948–2013, and a median value and standard deviation based on June discharge from the years 1940–2013. The remaining nine simulations were set at future climate conditions for June discharge and May temperature. We determined future mean monthly May temperature and mean monthly June discharge values based on climate simulation results from an ensemble average of 30 downscaled climate models for an RCP 8.5 emissions scenario at mid-century (2050–2074; USGS National Climate Change Viewer; [
