<p class="p">We modeled two different types of drought simulations based on current and future projected drought frequency in the region. Summer drought conditions are presently common in runoff dominated rivers like the Buffalo River in this region [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We based present drought chances on long term discharge data from the Buffalo River during summer months (June-September) where we defined a moderate drought year as being lower than 50% of mean discharge during the period of record (1940â€“2013) and a strong drought year as being less than 25% of mean discharge. Natural mortality during moderate drought years was increased 50% above normal levels for all age groups and natural mortality during strong drought years was increased 75% above normal levels for all age groups. In future higher frequency drought simulations, we modeled expected future increases in drought in this region (moderate drought 5% more frequent and extreme drought 9% more frequent; [
