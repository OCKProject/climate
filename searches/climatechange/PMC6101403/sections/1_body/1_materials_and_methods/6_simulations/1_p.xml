<p class="p">The simulation model runs on an annual time step from October to October and each simulation was conducted over 100 years and replicated 1,000 times. We began each simulation with a very high abundance for each age group of fish (
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). A break-in period followed before the model settled into a relatively stable abundance of each age group of fish around year ten. Preliminary runs of our simulation model indicated an under prediction of adult abundance in present climate simulations compared to empirical data. Therefore, we modified the number of age-0 smallmouth bass predicted by the Ricker recruit-spawner model by multiplying by four in all simulations. This resulted in very similar predicted abundances in the present climate simulation to the mean CPUE of adult smallmouth bass collected in empirical data.
