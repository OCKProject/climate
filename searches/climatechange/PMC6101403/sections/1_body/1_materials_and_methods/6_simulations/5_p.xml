<p class="p">We modeled two different harvest morality simulations. Though recent estimates of harvest of smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River are not available, we used harvest mortality estimates from similar Missouri Ozark rivers in our simulations (approximately 20% annual harvest mortality; [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]). Use of the Buffalo River has increased in recent years (a 240% increase in visitors from 2000 to 2016; [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]) and is likely to increase in the future, potentially leading to higher harvest of smallmouth bass. Assuming no change in regulations and an increase in river use, we modeled a future harvest scenario as 75% higher than present harvest mortality (35% annual harvest mortality). Finally, we modeled a scenario where harvest of smallmouth bass is closed to facilitate a comparison of the importance of harvest and other mortality factors in affecting population levels.
