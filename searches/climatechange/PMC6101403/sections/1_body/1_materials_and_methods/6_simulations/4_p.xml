<p class="p">We modeled two different types of flood simulations based on current and future projected flood frequency in the region. We simulated flooding during the spawning and rearing period and the associated mortality of age-0 fish. Though floods likely affect older age groups as well, it is more difficult to quantify those effects. Similar to drought, we simulated flooding probabilistically where every year had a chance to be a flood year. We based present flood probability on discharge data from the Buffalo River (1940–2013) during June where we defined a flood event as an increase in mean June discharge of 100% above median discharge (about 10% of years from 1940–2013). If a flood year occurred, mortality of age-0 fish was set at 90%. We modeled some scenarios as having a higher flood chance to simulate an increase in extreme precipitation events due to climate change. Though increases in extreme precipitation events are expected in this region, there are no models projecting the associated effects on numbers of flood events with high confidence in this region [
