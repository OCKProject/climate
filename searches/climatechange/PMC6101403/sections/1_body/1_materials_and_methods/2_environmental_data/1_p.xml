<p class="p">Environmental data for monthly mean air temperature and monthly mean river discharge were obtained in order to relate to yearly CPUE of age-0 smallmouth bass. We selected these discharge and temperature variables to relate to age-0 fish abundances as similar environmental variables are related to age-0 smallmouth bass recruitment in other river systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. We downloaded daily discharge data from USGS gage 07056000 on the Buffalo River near St. Joe, AR. We used these data to determine mean monthly discharge and standard deviation for the years 1940â€“2013. Air temperature data was downloaded from long-term climate data collected by a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency National Center for Climate Data weather station in nearby Harrison, AR (Station USW00013971). We related mean monthly air temperature and mean monthly discharge to CPUE of age-0 smallmouth bass for each month during the spawning/rearing period (March-July) using a simple linear regression for each variable. The month with the strongest relationship based on least squares regression R
