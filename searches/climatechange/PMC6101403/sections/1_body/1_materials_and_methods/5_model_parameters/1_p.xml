<p class="p">Age-group mortality within the simulation model was assessed through two different mechanisms. First was natural mortality factors that varied among age groups in the simulation model (
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Natural mortality values were based on previous work in the Buffalo River, but these studies only estimated survival for all ages combined and do not separate harvest mortality [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]-[
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We modified these estimates to reflect higher mortality of young age classes (
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Age-0 fish mortality is set at a low level to reflect overwinter mortality as age-0 fish abundance is predicted for October. We assigned a standard deviation to every mortality value to create variation among simulation years and reflect the stochastic nature of stream systems. The second form of mortality that we assessed was harvest mortality. We applied harvest mortality to adult fish age-4+ as the Buffalo River currently has a 305 mm length limit and most age-4+ smallmouth bass in the river are above this length cutoff [
