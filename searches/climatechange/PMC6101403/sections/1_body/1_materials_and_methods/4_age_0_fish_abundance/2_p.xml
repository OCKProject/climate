<p class="p">To evaluate uncertainty within the model, we conducted a sensitivity analysis on each of the parameters predicted by the non-linear regression where all other values were held constant (May temperature, Adult CPUE, and June discharge were set at the mean values from collected data). We modified each parameter by ± 25% and recorded the values of predicted age-0 CPUE (

The parameter modifying adult CPUE (b) was the most influential in the model and so we next predicted age-0 CPUE based on a range of adult CPUE values. For each adult CPUE value, we varied the parameter b ± 25% to demonstrate model uncertainty (
