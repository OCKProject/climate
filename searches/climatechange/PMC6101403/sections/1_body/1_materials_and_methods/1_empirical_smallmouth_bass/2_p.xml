<p class="p">We next created length histograms for each site to estimate the length cutoff between age-0 and older fish in order to determine the number of age-0 fish collected during each sampling event. This length cutoff varied by site and by year (

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Counts of age-0 and adult fish were then standardized by dividing by sampling effort (minutes of shocking time) for each sample. These standardized catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data were then used in subsequent analyses.
