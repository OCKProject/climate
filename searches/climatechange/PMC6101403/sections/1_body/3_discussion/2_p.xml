<p class="p">Flooding during the spawning and rearing period can devastate year classes of lotic smallmouth bass [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]). Heavy precipitation events have increased over the past century, leading to more frequent high flow events [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Climate change is likely to increase the frequency of severe storms that will affect short-term discharge variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and lead to more high flow events. However, high flow during any period of spawning and rearing is likely to negatively affect smallmouth bass year class strength [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This corresponds to our empirical data where a single year had a very high June discharge level (23.28 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s) and almost no age-0 smallmouth bass were collected that year. Overwinter discharge can also be an important predictor of smallmouth bass recruitment [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. We chose not to include overwinter discharge or temperature in the juvenile fish reproduction model because overwinter survival is less of a concern at southern latitude populations as spawning occurs relatively early in the year, allowing time for a long growing season before winter [
