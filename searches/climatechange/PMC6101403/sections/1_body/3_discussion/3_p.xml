<p class="p">Our simulations indicate that increases in drought frequency could strongly affect abundance of smallmouth bass in the Buffalo River. Previous work has documented a decline in body condition of smallmouth bass during summer months in some streams in the Ozark region, including the upper Buffalo River [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], and it is likely that increasing stream temperature due to climate change will decrease growth potential of smallmouth bass during summer months [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Drought in the Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands leads to pool isolation in runoff streams and pool isolation can increase competition and predation risk [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Strong drought can cause severe abiotic conditions within pools [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] and can lead directly to mortality of smallmouth bass through complete drying of pools [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In our simulations, drought was the only stressor that affected every age class, leading to the strong effects we found.
