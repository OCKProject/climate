<p class="p">Our model has a number of management implications. Our results indicate that increases in drought prevalence could have the strongest effects on smallmouth bass abundance. Management actions designed to mitigate the effects of drought could reduce these effects. For example, management in this region could be directed towards reducing water withdrawals [

Though we found that increases in flooding frequency had a much smaller effect on adult smallmouth bass abundance than drought, reducing flooding risk by decreasing channelization and protecting the riparian buffer could reduce the flashiness of streams [

The Buffalo River region is remote, reducing the risk of major land use changes over the coming century, but increases in development and agriculture usage in the watershed could further increase flooding chances and alter discharge during the spawning and rearing period, affecting fish populations [
