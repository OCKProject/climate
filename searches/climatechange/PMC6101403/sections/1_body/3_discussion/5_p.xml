<p class="p">There are several limitations inherent in our modeling approach. We do not attempt to model some aspects of smallmouth bass population dynamics such as growth, intraspecific competition, migration, and dispersal. Our modeling also only takes into account a few of the potential effects of climate change. For example, we do not simulate habitat or land use changes that could occur over the coming century. However, a riparian buffer around the Buffalo River is protected by the National Park Service which may limit effects of land use change on the river. We also assume that relationships between May temperature and June discharge and smallmouth bass recruitment will be the same in the future as during the period that data was collected. The Buffalo River is a runoff stream and other stream types, such as intermittent or groundwater dominated, could have different responses to climate change than runoff streams (e.g., temperature, [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], which could reduce the effectiveness of eliminating harvest through changing regulations. An additional assumption of our model is that variables such as age-specific mortality vary independently each year.
