<p class="p">Our simulation model predicted an increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass under future May temperature and June discharge conditions, but this population increase could be offset by other expected climate related changes in the region such as increased drought and flooding. Temperature and discharge during the spawning and rearing period have been shown to affect year-class strength of lotic smallmouth bass in other streams [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Mean June discharge was found to be the best predictor of smallmouth bass recruitment in three Virginia Rivers and years with very high flows in June led to near year-class failures [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Higher temperatures during spring and summer months can positively affect smallmouth bass recruitment through increased growth which can reduce predation risk and increase overwinter survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Climate change is likely to result in an increase in May temperature and a decline in June discharge, both of which should benefit smallmouth bass recruitment, leading to higher adult abundances.
