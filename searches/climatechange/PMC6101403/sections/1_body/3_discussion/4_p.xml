<p class="p">Angler harvest is an important mortality component in exploited fish populations. A recent angler creel survey on the Buffalo River found almost no harvest of smallmouth bass, despite high levels of angler effort [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. In contrast, work conducted in six Ozark streams in Missouri found that exploitation ranged from 7â€“26% of the population with three rivers having exploitation rates over 20% [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We chose to model current exploitation near the high level found in Missouri streams as the Buffalo Creel survey authors urge caution in utilizing the estimates from the creel survey [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] and the Buffalo River likely experiences as high or higher usage than the Missouri streams [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Missouri Ozark streams are closed to harvest for approximately three months in the spring, but there is no harvest closure in the Buffalo River, indicating that our present simulation harvest estimate is likely conservative. Our high exploitation scenario reflects increasing usage of the river in future years.
