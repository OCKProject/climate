<p class="p">More restrictive harvest regulations could reduce the negative effects of climate change on smallmouth bass populations in the Buffalo River. Currently, the river has a twelve inch minimum length limit and a four fish bag limit. In future climate scenarios with high drought and high flooding probability, smallmouth bass populations were 52% lower in scenarios with high harvest and 30% lower in scenarios with present harvest levels as compared to a simulation without harvest included. In addition, removing harvest almost eliminated the chance of smallmouth bass population extinction occurring. Managers could consider restricting or eliminating bag limits for smallmouth bass if noticeable declines in adult smallmouth bass abundance occur due to climate change.</p>
