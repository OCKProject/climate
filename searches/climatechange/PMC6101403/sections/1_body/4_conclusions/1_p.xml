<p class="p">We found that changes in May temperature and June discharge could benefit smallmouth bass recruitment, but increased flooding and increased drought conditions are likely to reduce adult smallmouth bass abundance below present levels in the Buffalo River. Reducing or eliminating harvest could prove a viable strategy to reduce the negative effects of climate change and lessen the risk of population extinction. Efforts to reduce flooding or drought effects within the Buffalo River could also reduce the negative effects on smallmouth bass populations. Future work is needed to further understand the effects of climate change on smallmouth bass populations at the southern range extent, especially in streams from differing flow regimes.</p>
