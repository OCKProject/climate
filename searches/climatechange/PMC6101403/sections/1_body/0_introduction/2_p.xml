<p class="p">Harvest is also an important factor structuring stream fish populations. For example, harvest of stream black bass is an important contributor to mortality in streams open to exploitation (e.g., Suwannee bass and largemouth bass, [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]). Climate change will likely make managing harvested fisheries more complex and harvest regulations will need to be adapted as fish populations change [
