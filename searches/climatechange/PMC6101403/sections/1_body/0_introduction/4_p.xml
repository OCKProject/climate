<p class="p">To investigate the relative effects of angler harvest and climate change on the smallmouth bass population in the Buffalo National River, Arkansas (hereafter, Buffalo River) we created an age-structured population model to simulate various climate and harvest scenarios. The structure for the model was based on previous work comparing land use and climate change effects on lotic smallmouth bass in an Illinois river [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. We used empirical data collected in the Buffalo River to create a Ricker recruit-spawner model modified with environmental parameters which was subsequently used to predict annual recruitment of age-0 smallmouth bass within a stage structured simulation model. Our objective was to compare the effects of climate change stressors (i.e., flooding and drought) and harvest mortality on smallmouth bass. We hypothesized that changing climate conditions would negatively affect smallmouth bass populations. In addition, we hypothesized that if current levels of harvest were maintained or increased in future climate scenarios, then smallmouth bass populations would further decline and extinction probability would increase.
