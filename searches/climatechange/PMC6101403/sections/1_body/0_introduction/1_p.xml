<p class="p">The anticipated effects of climate change on aquatic ecosystems globally will be complex [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and are likely to result in increased temperature, decreased dissolved oxygen, increased toxicity of pollutants, and changes in hydrologic regimes [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Stream fishes may be particularly susceptible to the effects of climate change. For example, climate change could affect stream fishes through changes in stream discharge patterns such as increased flooding chances [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Spring floods can lead to failed year classes of fishes in streams (e.g., smallmouth bass

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]; Salmonids, [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]; shoal bass 
 <italic class="italic">Micropterus cataractae</italic>, [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]). Flooding can affect smallmouth bass year class strength through nest destruction and fry displacement [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]-[
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Flooding can also lead to mortality through rapid changes in water temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Timing of flooding can be important as the size of the fry can determine the response to the flood event [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]-[
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Though chances of flooding could increase due to climate change, in some regions, climate change is also expected to result in an overall reduction in precipitation which could lead to lower mean discharge levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Recruitment of fish in many stream systems can be positively affected by low discharge levels during the spawning and rearing period which often enhances year class strength [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Water temperature will also be affected by climate change and can influence growth and survival of stream fishes [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Changes in stream temperature could also lead to range restrictions or expansions [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Because of the many potential effects of climate change on stream systems, it can be difficult to anticipate how stream fishes will be affected.
