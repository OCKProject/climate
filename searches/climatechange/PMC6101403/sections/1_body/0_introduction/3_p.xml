<p class="p">Smallmouth bass are a warm-water riverine species broadly distributed throughout North America. The Ozark-Ouachita Interior Highlands of Arkansas lie at the southern extent of smallmouth bass native range. The southern region of the United States is projected to warm 3–4°C by the year 2050 [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Along with the temperature change is an expected change in precipitation, including more extreme events leading to higher stochasticity and potentially an increase in flooding frequency and severity [

 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Precipitation patterns are likely to change seasonally and a decrease in precipitation is anticipated in the summer months [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], potentially leading to more severe and longer drought conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0202737.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. At this southern range extent, smallmouth bass populations may be vulnerable to population declines due to climate change as summer temperatures will likely reach levels that will affect growth and survivorship [
