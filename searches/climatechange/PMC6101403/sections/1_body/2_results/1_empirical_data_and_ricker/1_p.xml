<p class="p">A total of 325 age-0 smallmouth bass and 994 adult smallmouth bass were retained for use in analyses. Catch per unit effort ranged from 0.03 to 0.41 for age-0 fish and from 0.11 to 0.99 for adult fish. Age-0 CPUE was most strongly related to May temperature (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.15) and June discharge (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.29) and these variables were included in the Ricker recruit-spawner model.
