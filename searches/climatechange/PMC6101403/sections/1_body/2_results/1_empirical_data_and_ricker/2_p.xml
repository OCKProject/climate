<p class="p">Sensitivity analysis was performed on the four parameters within the Ricker model equation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0202737.s002" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). These analyses indicated that parameter b, modifying adult abundance, was the most influential parameter in the model. A ± 25% change in b elicited a 39% decrease and a 29% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish predicted by the model when all other parameters were held at mean values. A ± 25% change in a resulted in a 13% decrease and a 15% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish. A ± 25% change in c resulted in a 10% decrease and a 12% increase in CPUE of age-0 fish. A ± 25% change in d resulted in a 16% decrease and a 19% increase in CPUE age-0 fish. Because of the indicated importance of adult abundance in structuring model results, we plotted predicted age-0 abundance by a range of adult abundance values to examine model behavior with the error ranges showing the range of results if b was varied ± 25% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The linear regression between predicted age-0 CPUE and observed age-0 CPUE indicated that our model adequately predicted the number of age-0 fish (p = 0.004, R
