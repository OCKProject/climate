<p class="p">The future climate simulation predicted a 15% increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass compared to present conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). This scenario only took into account changes in May temperature and June discharge, not increased flooding, drought, or harvest conditions. The only other scenario that predicted an increase in abundance of adult smallmouth bass from present conditions was the future high flood scenario (6% increase in adult CPUE; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). Simulations with increased drought chances predicted a large decline in adult abundance from present conditions (52% decline in adult CPUE for the high drought scenario; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>) and the scenario with high drought, high flood, and high harvest had the greatest change from present conditions for any modeled scenario (71% reduction in adult CPUE; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>). In the final scenario, harvest was eliminated in the model, resulting in a 46% decline in CPUE compared to the present climate simulation, less of a decline than any other scenario with high drought included (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0202737.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>). The only scenarios where extinction occurred were scenarios that included high probabilities of drought. Extinction probabilities ranged from 0 in present climate conditions to 0.08 in the scenario with high drought, flood, and harvest (
