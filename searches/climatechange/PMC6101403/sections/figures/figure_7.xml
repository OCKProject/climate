  <title class="title">Results for all simulation model scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">Mean adult abundances based on 1,000 replications for the final year (year 100) for each model simulation (A) and proportion of simulations where smallmouth bass population extinction occurred (B). P represents present climate conditions (May temperature and June discharge), F represents future climate conditions (May temperature and June discharge), HH represents high harvest, HF represents high flood, HD represents high drought, and NH represents no harvest. Error bars indicate standard error based on the 1,000 replications of each simulation.</p>
