<p class="p">As discussed above, there are significant limitations to predicting the duration of climate change refugia. Unlike historical, more cyclical climate contexts, contemporary trends of greenhouse gas emissions indicate long-term directional warming with temperatures predicted to exceed Quaternary levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Climate change refugia might only be relevant for a certain degree of climatic change, after which conditions in refugia might become climatically stressful for the populations they were designed to protect [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, climate change refugia are not necessarily long-term solutions [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. They function best when coupled with contingency plans, such as tracking geographic shifts in refugial habitats to keep pace with climate change or maintaining genetic material in seed banks, captive propagation, or zoos for future re-introduction.
