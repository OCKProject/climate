<p class="p">As identification is key to conserving climate change refugia, we begin with a discussion of the processes that create them. Climate change refugia are characterized by the occurrence of relatively stable local climatic conditions that persist over time, despite change at regional and global scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. This can occur from independent or interacting processes that dampen local climatic variability through time or amplify spatial heterogeneity within a region. Below (and in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159909.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) we review representative examples of these processes (also see [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). How and whether these processes will be maintained as climate changes in the future remain important research questions [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]; in many environments, current modeling techniques are not able to capture fine-scale processes adequately [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We suggest that understanding the processes that lead to climate change refugia will be critical for effectively identifying, mapping, and conserving them to meet management objectives as laid out in the framework introduced later in this paper.
