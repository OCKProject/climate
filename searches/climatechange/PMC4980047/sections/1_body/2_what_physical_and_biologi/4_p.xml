<p class="p">Freshwater climate change refugia for cold-water-adapted species such as salmonids are commonly recognized and increasingly well-studied [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Streams and rivers that are buffered from regional air temperatures via cold groundwater inputs from deep aquifers provide cold, sustained streamflows in regions where water temperatures would otherwise become too warm or streamflows too low during the summer months [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Such large, cold, connected river networks are recognized as regional strongholds for imperiled fish populations facing increasing pressures from climate warming and other stressors [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Other examples of aquatic and marine climate change refugia include areas of cold water within warm river networks [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Yet, drought and declining base-flows might reduce groundwater inputs into streams, and changes in the geomorphology and riparian vegetation structure of stream reaches can promote or hinder the formation of cold-water refugia [
