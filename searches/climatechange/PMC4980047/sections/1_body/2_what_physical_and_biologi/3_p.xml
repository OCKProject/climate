<p class="p">Moisture distribution is another common source of spatial heterogeneity as climate changes. Wet areas, including wetlands, riparian zones, rock glaciers, and talus slopes (see American pika case study in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159909.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), can act as climate change refugia [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In semi-arid and desert regions, groundwater-fed seeps and springs support persistent populations of highly diverse taxa [

Similarly, deep snow drifts, which can be found in downwind topographic depressions, in granite fissures, or at the base of steep slopes, can serve as important hydrologic reserves. Furthermore, large bodies of water and their surroundings, like coastal areas or deep lakes, are buffered from regional warming because more of the sunâ€™s energy is expended in evaporation than in surface heating [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Many of these areas have persisted through the climatic changes of the Holocene, highlighting their capacity to act as distinctive refugial areas. However, loss of moisture or transition from snow- to rain-dominated hydrology might exceed tipping points [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], leading to loss of stability; e.g., glaciers feeding critical water sources that melt out or depletion of groundwater sources from overwithdrawal.
