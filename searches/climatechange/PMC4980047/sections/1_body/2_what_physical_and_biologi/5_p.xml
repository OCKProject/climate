<p class="p">Biologically-mediated processes creating climate change refugia include vegetation effects that can mediate physical disturbance [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] as well as enhance other refugial properties [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. For example, forest canopies and riparian corridors buffer against climate extremes and variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] with consequences for both temperature and water balance. Habitat variability (e.g., variable stand densities, forest gaps, evergreen/deciduous mosaics, riparian corridors) can also increase spatial variability in climate, creating shade and allowing for short-distance dispersal and movements to compensate for climate changes. Areas that are protected from climate-related disturbance, such as increasingly severe fires and extreme floods, also can be considered climate change refugia [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Resource managers could consider manipulating these vegetation properties, including structure and fuel loading that lower the risk of increasingly severe fires, to enhance refugial characteristics.
