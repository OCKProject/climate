 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century paleoecologists looked to climate refugia to account for poleward and upward species migrations following glacial retreat [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Populations persisted and survived during the last glacial maximum in habitats where climate change was buffered or compensated, and in regions where suitable climates were displaced toward the equator or to lower elevations relative to their postglacial distribution. Not only did refugia provide a safe haven during periods of unfavorable climate, but they served as sources for colonization following climate warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Other research has focused on characterizing refugia as “species pumps” that, due to their isolation and persistence, led to the development of new species and acted as biodiversity hotspots [
