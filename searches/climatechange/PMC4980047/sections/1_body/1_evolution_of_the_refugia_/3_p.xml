<p class="p">In the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, the idea of a refugium as a place uniquely buffered from the intense cold and fluctuations of glacial climates expanded to encompass not only past glaciations, but also high temperatures, droughts, and fluctuating sea-levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. With contemporary climate change, species are projected to colonize newly suitable habitats, with populations extirpated at some currently suitable sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. At the same time, “relict” populations are projected to persist in some places owing to unique local habitat conditions, including local dampening of regional climate change effects, which can be seen now in isolated remnants of populations that were distributed widely [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These refugia exist because of unique physical characteristics (e.g., climate dynamics, topography) that influence local resource attributes (e.g., species persistence, habitat stability). Physically-based definitions of climate refugia emphasize the mechanisms that enable an area to remain buffered from regional influences and usually do not attempt to link refugia to particular ecological components, such as species or habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Biogeographic approaches to refugia emphasize the stability of favorable future habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Although this approach is primarily based on correlative species distribution models (SDMs) [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], Dobrowski [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] argued for mechanistic research to expose interactions between refugial terrain, climatic processes, and species distributions.
