<p class="p">Other methods recognize climate change refugia based on biological data. Past persistence through climate change might be a clue to locations buffered in the future, either for native species or those that will shift into the area [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. For example, disjunct populations of cool-temperate plant species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Tsuga canadensis</italic>) are scattered across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Kentucky, apparent relicts of northward postglacial migrations in the late-glacial or early Holocene. The populations are concentrated in unique microhabitats, usually north-facing slopes and shaded ravines. Similarly, relict populations at the rear or trailing edge of a speciesâ€™ range might indicate climate change refugia [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Moreover, these sites often house important genetic and trait diversity because they are older and perhaps more adapted to conditions at the environmental margin [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. A systematic inventory of disjunct plant and animal species, accompanied by local habitat characterization and by determination (from biogeography, paleoecology, genetics, or environmental history) of whether they represent relicts or naturalized non-native species, can provide a foundation for broad generalizations on the nature and properties of climate change refugia [
