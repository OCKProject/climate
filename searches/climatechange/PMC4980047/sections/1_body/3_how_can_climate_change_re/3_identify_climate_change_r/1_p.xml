<p class="p">Where extensive climate and resource data are lacking, first approximations of refugia can be identified based upon the physical and biotic processes that buffer climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159909.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). For example, Ashcroft and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] used climatically stable regions within a topographically diverse landscape to predict regions associated with refugial communities. One can also compare current environmental conditions with climate scenarios to map domains that are likely to act as climate change refugia in the future, although this requires high resolution data or in situ measurements [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. A related method calculates climate change velocity, which uses the distance required to reach a similar climate in the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] to identify areas with exceptionally low magnitudes of future change relative to their spatial gradients. Ground-based weather and climate data collection and modeling provide very promising approaches for generating high-resolution regional climate models [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. However, comprehensive climate data at scales adequate to capture finer-scale refugia for multiple resources and taxa remain elusive due to issues of data continuity, accessibility, and affordability [
