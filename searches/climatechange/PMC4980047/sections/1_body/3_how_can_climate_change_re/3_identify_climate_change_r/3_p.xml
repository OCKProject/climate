<p class="p">One can also identify areas of high genetic diversity or persistence for climate vulnerable species or other resources, which might indicate places where populations have persisted owing to climatic stability or high topographic variability. Morelli and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] used occupancy modeling of Belding's ground squirrels (
 <italic class="italic">Urocitellus beldingi</italic>) to identify “anthropogenic” climate change refugia, areas where populations appear to have persisted through time in habitats due to artificial buffering from climate change by food or water supplementation (
