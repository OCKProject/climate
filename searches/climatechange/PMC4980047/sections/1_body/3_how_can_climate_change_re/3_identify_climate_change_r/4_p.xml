<p class="p">Ecological niche models (ENMs) incorporate occurrences with environmental data to yield an estimate of potential geographic distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. These correlative approaches essentially combine aspects of the ecological and physical definitions of refugia. Areas where ENMs predict continued persistence under future climate scenarios might indicate climate change refugia (e.g., 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159909.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). There are a variety of applications of these techniques to estimate potential shifts in distribution due to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Although they have clear limitations [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], more precise estimates of future suitability can be provided by models that incorporate finer-resolution climate data [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Overlaying modeled estimates for multiple species or other valued resources can indicate climate change refugia under various scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Different areas could be identified as climate change refugia depending on whether physical or ecological methods are employed (
