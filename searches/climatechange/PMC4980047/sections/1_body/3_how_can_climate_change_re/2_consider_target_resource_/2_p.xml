<p class="p">Assessing vulnerability of the resource to climate change is the next step (

 <italic class="italic">sensitivity</italic> of a resource and measures its 
 <italic class="italic">exposure</italic> to particular aspects of, as well its

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Key questions to consider include: What aspects of climate change make the resource most vulnerable? What resource characteristics or life history stages might be particularly sensitive to climate change? Does the resource have flexibility to adjust to these changes? Spatially mapping vulnerability factors will help in assessing the potential for local variability.
