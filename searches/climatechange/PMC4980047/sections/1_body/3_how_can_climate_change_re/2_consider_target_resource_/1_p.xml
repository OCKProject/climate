<p class="p">Similar to the climate-smart conservation cycle [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], the first step of managing climate change refugia is to determine the purpose and scope (
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, step 1) by defining the management or conservation target (“valued resource”). The relevant spatial scale can be global, regional, or local; examples include the broader ecoregion encompassing a park or the spatial extent of the focal resource, such as a species’ range. Importantly, the scale of analysis is distinct from the management scale. For instance, landscape connectivity of refugia is important to their effectiveness [

 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], even though only a small part of the network might be managed. Nonetheless, managers can set measurable objectives that support broader conservation goals.
