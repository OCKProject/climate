<p class="p">Following the vulnerability assessment, management or conservation goals should be reevaluated to ensure they remain attainable [
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], including whether refugia management is an effective strategy (
 <xref rid="pone.0159909.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, Step 3). Climate change refugia will be most relevant to resources that are moderately to highly vulnerable to climate change on a regional scale, but for which spatial variability in vulnerability factors suggest local buffering of climate change impacts. In addition, climate change refugia management might be a worthwhile strategy for highly valued targets, such as iconic or endemic species, even if they are less vulnerable than other resources. Within a large landscape conservation strategy, projections of population extirpation or other resource loss from a given park might necessitate changing the park management goal from “keeping it common” to “ensuring it remains present”. The revised goals, along with results from the vulnerability assessment (e.g., particular climate change exposure variables yielding high sensitivity), will drive the methods for identifying climate change refugia and mapping them.
