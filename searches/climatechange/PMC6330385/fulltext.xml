Vulnerable population groups in South Africa, especially those living in poverty, children, women, the elderly and people with pre-existing diseases, are susceptible to health threats resulting from climate change, such as increasing temperature, floods and droughts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Little is known about the coping capacities of vulnerable sub-populations with respect to these climate change-related environmental effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Environmental Health Practitioners (EHPs) play an important role in local implementation of adaptation strategies, particularly in communities with vulnerable populations. Equally so, climate change adaptation tends often correspond more closely to environmental health practice at a local rather than global level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">IPCC defines Southern Africa as a region likely to experience an increase in temperature that exceeds the global average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

EHPs deal with the environmental safety and health of communities in the local sphere of government [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Each of the nine provinces are managed by local government agencies, namely district and metropolitan municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The largest urbanized areas are governed by metropolitan municipalities, while the rest of the country is divided into district municipalities, each of which consists of several local municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are 228 local municipalities grouped into 44 district municipalities and eight metropolitan municipalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. According to SA Health Review (2017), the ratio of EHPs per 100,000 target population by province ranges from 0.4 to 2.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. EHPs are registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) and in 2015, there were 3585 registered EHPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The work of EHPs is defined in their Scope of Practice of Environmental Health and includes water quality, food control, waste managements, health surveillance of premises, surveillance and prevention of communicable diseases, vector control and environmental pollution control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Although the Scope of Practice does not explicitly mention climate change and health-related adaption action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], their core work areas are increasingly affected by climate change.</p><p id="Par15">In 2011, the Conference of the Parties (COP)-17 meeting hosted in South Africa stipulated the importance of involving EHPs, health care professionals and health officials in helping communities to increase their resilience and capacity to respond to, and withstand the impact of climate change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In South Africa, the National Climate Change Response White Paper [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] outlines the National Department of Health&#x02019;s (NDOH&#x02019;s) responsibilities related to mitigation and adaptation to climate change and emphasises the role of EHPs as part of this effort. Furthermore, South Africa&#x02019;s National Climate Change and Health Adaptation Plan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] calls for EHPs to help address adaptation measures to prevent adverse health effects in vulnerable communities. Despite this, it is not clear what role EHPs currently play in relation to climate change. The extent to which adaptation programmes have been incorporated into environmental health departments (namely divisions that deal with safety, health and sustainability of local communities) or work programmes for EHPs is largely unknown.</p><p id="Par16">Acknowledging the sizeable portion of the South African population bearing significant ill health burdens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], as well as those vulnerable to climate change because of their socioeconomic status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], it is essential to mainstream adaptation measures in EHP work programmes. These measures need to be innovative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] to ensure that adaptive climate change interventions, such as planting of trees to provide shade during heat waves or installing air conditioning in public buildings, effectively reduce or eliminate climate risks and improve quality of life. EHPs working in the private, public or voluntary sectors are increasingly expected to work towards helping communities in preventing adverse health outcomes and should therefore be knowledgeable of climate change impacts and preventative actions to mitigate adverse effects well in advance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Their efforts may entail reducing air pollution and carbon emissions, preparing for extreme weather events, and identifying environmental health exposure risks that cause such infectious diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This study aimed to assess the climate change-related perceptions, knowledge and preparedness of a sample of South African EHPs to identify gaps and opportunities to better inform training and education awareness campaigns among health professionals, as well as consider the role of EHPs in implementing climate change-related adaptation actions in communities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study population and study site</title><p id="Par17">The study population comprised EHPs who attended the 2017 South African Institute of Environmental Health (SAIEH) conference for EHPs in Cape Town.

With first-hand community engagement, EHPs can contribute to the shaping of national and local strategies, policies and regulations aimed at supporting vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change. Our study results highlight that although EHPs believe they should be playing a role in climate change adaptation, two-thirds believed that this role should be supportive, rather than leading. Many EHPs (42.0%) reported that climate change adaptation action was best undertaken at a global level suggesting that EHPs may not fully identify their role in climate change adaptation among communities.</p><p id="Par27">In South Africa, the National Climate Change Response White Paper and the Climate Change and Health Adaptation Plan provide a useful framework for EHP action at local level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, the details of an integrated and holistic local level climate and health adaptation strategy need to be developed and implemented nation-wide. Presently comprehensive information on community level policy, the role of inter-sectoral action, regulations and standards, budgetary matters, research, training and education in relation to climate change and health is lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In the current study, while two in three environmental health departments had institutional arrangements in place to support EHP actions on adaptation to climate change there were several potential barriers such as budgetary and resource constraints. Some municipalities did have climate change and health strategies or policies in place, for example, Western Cape (City of Cape Town) and KwaZulu-Natal (eThekwini Municipality), however, capacity and financial constraints were identified as challenges.</p><p id="Par28">In the current study, most EHPs had received tertiary training of at least a diploma or bachelor&#x02019;s degree, illustrating their capability to address climate-related health impacts with knowledge and understanding. One in two EHPs reported having had both formal and informal training on climate change, however, biases and inaccuracies may exist in the knowledge and skills of the EHPs who received informal training which may include listening to friends and reading non-peer-reviewed internet sources. Formal EHP training on climate change and environmental health is essential and should be consistently included in the EHP formal curriculum and training at higher degree institutions. It is unclear from the formal environmental health curriculum taught across multiple institutions and in varying formats exactly what is covered on climate change-related health impacts and adaptation measures. It is likely to be a high-level overview; therefore, further research is needed to gauge what subject matter is taught and / or required for teaching EHPs on this important public health issue. In terms of the capacity of EHPs to help communities adapt to climate change, the World Health Organization suggests there should be a ratio of 1 EHP/10000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. South Africa has adopted a national ratio of 1 EHP/15000 population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In 2016 the public sector EHP/population ratio was 1:78000 (calculated using 2016 on Statistics South Africa population data). This presents a multi-pronged barrier towards designing and implementing adaptation strategies as human resources are essential in managing climate change at community-level.</p><p id="Par29">EHPs highlighted several adaptation measures, such as providing access to air conditioning in public buildings as effective factors for controlling heat-related stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. They also recommended heat emergency plans detailing the human and material resources needed to reduce or manage risks associated with weather-related disasters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For EHPs to fully realize their potential to help communities adapt to climate change, there needs to be an inclusive discussion on the nature of the role they might play, and the essential resources needed to support their efforts. Inspiration might be taken from some encouraging initiatives currently underway. For example, the City of Rustenburg, in partnership with the South African Medical Research Council, is currently in the process of developing a Heat and Health Plan for its citizens. The effort was prompted by the designation of Rustenburg as a vulnerable location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] when, in 2016, during a single heatwave tens of people died in the North-West province. The climate and health adaptation measures suggested during a consultative workshop in Rustenburg echo those mentioned in the current study in which EHPs rated most highly tree planting, vegetable gardening, strengthening of policies and standards for storm water drainage, strengthening climate and health research programmes, and developing community early warning systems. On the other hand, the provision of cool spaces (air conditioning at schools and churches for example) and swimming pools, as well as cycling facilities, were given the lowest ratings. These adaptation mechanisms may have received the lowest ratings because they are uncommon occurrences in informal rural and low socio-economic settlements and may not be perceived as viable and affordable options.</p><p id="Par30">Implications of our findings point to a specific set of capabilities of EHPs which set them apart as agents of change compared to other public health practitioners. Our findings suggest that involvement of EHPs may be means to foster climate change adaption measures in communities. However, without defined and clear involvement, budget, education and practice to recognise the role of EHPs, the impact of climate change will continue to fall heavily on families living in the local communities. It is in the interests of both the environmental health profession and vulnerable communities throughout South Africa, for EHPs, without delay, to make a concerted effort to define and elaborate on the roles they intend to play in climate change and health adaptation in the country. However, this requires political will, operational policy, clear leadership and workforce development strategies from the national level. This study contributes to a platform of knowledge and understanding that may inform EHPs&#x02019; thinking, planning and improve climate change governance.</p><p id="Par31">Despite our attempts to bolster the sample size, our study sample was limited in that we used a conference as a venue to collect questionnaire responses from conference attendees. EHPs in South Africa are geographically dispersed across the country making them difficult to access, particularly when they are in the field and without Internet access. The conference seemed a convenient way to access a large group of EHPs. However, we did not have a representative sample of EHPs across all provinces of South Africa, since costs for travel to the conference venue from distant provinces may have limited participants from those provinces attending. We did try to incentivise participation by having a lucky draw for all respondents, however, respondents were likely those individuals who were interested in the topic which may skew our findings. Future studies should consider alternative sampling mechanisms, besides using a convenience sample at a conference, to gather responses from a fully representative sample. This might entail an online, mobile phone application or telephonic survey. Since the conference was held in Cape Town, majority of conference participants were based in Cape Town hence EHPs working in the Western Cape were oversampled. However, out of the eight metropolitan municipalities in South Africa, six metropolitan municipalities had representatives at the conference therefore &#x000be; of the major urban areas in the country were included. Of the 44 district municipalities nationwide, more than half (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) of them had representatives who participated in the study. Despite this, there was insufficient variation among the study sample to permit sub-analysis of the study findings. For example, most of the EHPs had tertiary education of similar levels, limiting analysis by education level and inferring that results likely pertain mostly to EHPs with similar education as the EHPs who responded to our questionnaire.</p><p id="Par32">The questionnaire was a combination of closed and open questions which allowed for both quantitative and qualitative analyses of findings. It did also make the questionnaire relatively long and may have discouraged participation. It may have been more insightful to have used a qualitative research method and get detailed information from key stakeholders rather than aim for a representative sample. There are limited studies on the perceptions, knowledge and preparedness of EHPs with regards to climate change and health adaptation. Therefore, despite the small sample size, this study adds to the body of evidence on the perceptions of EHPs and the important role they should have to curb adverse climate change-related human health impacts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">EHPs have a key role to play in resolving environmental challenges and preventing diseases of environmental origin to ensure healthy and safe environments for communities. Therefore, implementation of climate change adaptation plans should be incorporated within the EHPs Scope of Practise. EHPs acknowledge that climate change poses a serious threat to public health and they largely agree that they should play a supportive or leading role in helping communities adapt to climate change. Their efforts require the support of government management at all levels of governance. For environmental health departments to fully implement climate change and health adaptation measures and strengthen the national plans for climate change, adequate human and financial resources should be provided and trickle down to where EHPs need them to be effective &#x02018;agents of change&#x02019; among communities. As climate change occurs, EHPs will potentially have an important role to play in ensuring that the environments (especially built environments) in which people live, learn and play, are fit to promote and support health and safety. Owing to the spatial variability in climate change, the tasks of coping with its effects fall on EHPs as local government public practitioners.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>COP</term><def><p id="Par5">Conference of the Parties</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EHPs</term><def><p id="Par6">Environmental Health Practitioners</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPCSA</term><def><p id="Par7">Health Professions Council of South Africa</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IPCC</term><def><p id="Par8">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NDOH</term><def><p id="Par9">National Department of Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAIEH</term><def><p id="Par10">South African Institute of Environmental Health</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SALGA</term><def><p id="Par11">South African Local Government Association</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the EHPs who participated in the study and the South African Medical Research Council and National Research Foundation for funding the study.
