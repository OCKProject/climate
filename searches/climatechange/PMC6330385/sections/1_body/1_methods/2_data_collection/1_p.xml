<p id="Par18" class="p">Two study researchers attended the conference and were based at a stall set up in the main foyer of the conference venue. Upon their arrival, all EHPs were invited to participate in the study. Several appeals, for example, recruitment by researchers and announcements at plenary events, were made for EHPsâ€™ participation in the study. Following informed consent, the EHPs completed the questionnaires without assistance from the researchers. Participating EHPs were given a small token of appreciation and their name was also entered into a lucky draw for a small prize at the end of the data collection phase at the conference.</p>
