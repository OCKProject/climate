<p id="Par26" class="p">EHPs are located at the interface between government and communities, positioning them potentially well in relation to climate change adaptation and mitigation implementation. With first-hand community engagement, EHPs can contribute to the shaping of national and local strategies, policies and regulations aimed at supporting vulnerable communities to adapt to climate change. Our study results highlight that although EHPs believe they should be playing a role in climate change adaptation, two-thirds believed that this role should be supportive, rather than leading. Many EHPs (42.0%) reported that climate change adaptation action was best undertaken at a global level suggesting that EHPs may not fully identify their role in climate change adaptation among communities.</p>
