<p id="Par28" class="p">In the current study, most EHPs had received tertiary training of at least a diploma or bachelorâ€™s degree, illustrating their capability to address climate-related health impacts with knowledge and understanding. One in two EHPs reported having had both formal and informal training on climate change, however, biases and inaccuracies may exist in the knowledge and skills of the EHPs who received informal training which may include listening to friends and reading non-peer-reviewed internet sources. Formal EHP training on climate change and environmental health is essential and should be consistently included in the EHP formal curriculum and training at higher degree institutions. It is unclear from the formal environmental health curriculum taught across multiple institutions and in varying formats exactly what is covered on climate change-related health impacts and adaptation measures. It is likely to be a high-level overview; therefore, further research is needed to gauge what subject matter is taught and / or required for teaching EHPs on this important public health issue. In terms of the capacity of EHPs to help communities adapt to climate change, the World Health Organization suggests there should be a ratio of 1 EHP/10000 population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. In 2016 the public sector EHP/population ratio was 1:78000 (calculated using 2016 on Statistics South Africa population data). This presents a multi-pronged barrier towards designing and implementing adaptation strategies as human resources are essential in managing climate change at community-level.
