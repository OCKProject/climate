There are limited studies on the perceptions, knowledge and preparedness of EHPs with regards to climate change and health adaptation. Therefore, despite the small sample size, this study adds to the body of evidence on the perceptions of EHPs and the important role they should have to curb adverse climate change-related human health impacts.</p>
