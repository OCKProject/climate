 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. EHPs deal with the environmental safety and health of communities in the local sphere of government [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. Each of the nine provinces are managed by local government agencies, namely district and metropolitan municipalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. The largest urbanized areas are governed by metropolitan municipalities, while the rest of the country is divided into district municipalities, each of which consists of several local municipalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. There are 228 local municipalities grouped into 44 district municipalities and eight metropolitan municipalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. According to SA Health Review (2017), the ratio of EHPs per 100,000 target population by province ranges from 0.4 to 2.3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. EHPs are registered with the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA) and in 2015, there were 3585 registered EHPs [
