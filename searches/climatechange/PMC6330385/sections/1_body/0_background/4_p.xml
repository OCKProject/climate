 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] outlines the National Department of Health’s (NDOH’s) responsibilities related to mitigation and adaptation to climate change and emphasises the role of EHPs as part of this effort. Furthermore, South Africa’s National Climate Change and Health Adaptation Plan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] calls for EHPs to help address adaptation measures to prevent adverse health effects in vulnerable communities. Despite this, it is not clear what role EHPs currently play in relation to climate change. The extent to which adaptation programmes have been incorporated into environmental health departments (namely divisions that deal with safety, health and sustainability of local communities) or work programmes for EHPs is largely unknown.
