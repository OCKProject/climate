<p id="Par23" class="p">Experience of formal and informal training about climate change and health was reported by 48 EHPs with 53.0% stating conferences/seminars as the source of that training (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Majority (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 57) agreed that they had noticed climate change effects occurring in their local communities. These effects included drought (e.g. impacts such as crop failure and food production reduction), direct impacts on human health (e.g. malaria and cholera), flooding, increase in extreme weather events (including fires and thunderstorms), increase in temperature (and heatwaves), sea level rise, air pollution impacts, socio-economic impacts (e.g. unemployment and damage to property) and damage to infrastructure. Some EHPs gave specific examples such as ‘the grass is brownish now even during summer’, and another EHP said ‘there are suddenly floods in some areas of Johannesburg’. Drought and water restrictions were also mentioned by the respondents.
