<p id="Par21" class="p">Of the 201 delegates who attended the conference, 97% were EHPs. The in-depth questionnaire was completed by 70 EHPs, however, four EHPs did not meet the criteria as they were either stakeholders of SALGA or lecturers. This represented a response rate of 68.0% (total number of EHP delegates was given as 97). Because we used a self-reported approach non-response to some of the questions resulted in missing data.</p>
