<p class="p">The Construal Level Theory perspective leads to some counter-intuitive corollaries that are relevant for climate change communication. The relationships we observed between spatially varying risk perspectives and the two levels of implementation imply that appeals to change personal behaviour and to increase support for policies are most effective when they are combined with spatial information that is consistent with their respective construal. This logic is consistent with the reasoning of Construal Level Theory and with empirical findings on the effectiveness of matching construal levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The importance of matching levels could also explain why previous attempts to increase people’s engagement with climate change by portraying proximal impacts (i.e., low-level construal) were not successful in increasing support for policies and strengthening attitudes towards climate change mitigation (both high-level construals [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]). In short, on the basis of our results and current theory, we suggest that a proximal focus does not 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> lead to more involvement and stronger motivation to act on climate change (for a similar argument, see [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). Rather, climate change communication could be much more effective if different levels of construals are intentionally matched: Focussing people’s attention on local climate change seems well suited to enhance their willingness to take personal actions, probably more so if these actions are related to adaptation [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. However, with regard to support for policies it seems more effective to address the issue of climate change on a bigger scale and therefore remove climate change spatially from people rather than bring it closer to them [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], especially if these policies concern mitigation [
