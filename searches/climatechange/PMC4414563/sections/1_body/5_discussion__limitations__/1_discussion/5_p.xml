<p class="p">The variables we used to assess analytical risks and willingness to respond to climate change neatly map onto two dimensions of psychological distance: Proximal and distant risk perceptions can be mapped onto the dimension of spatial distance; personal behavioural intentions and policy support can be mapped onto the social dimension of psychological distance (
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> vs. 
 <italic class="italic">we</italic> do something). Perhaps the unexpected strong relationships we found between proximal risk perceptions and personal behavioural intentions on the one hand, and between distant risk perceptions and policy support on the other hand, are due to spontaneous matches with regard to psychological distance. Proximal risk perceptions are psychologically 
 <italic class="italic">proximal on the spatial dimension</italic> and personal behavioural intentions can be regarded as 
 <italic class="italic">proximal on the social dimension</italic> (it is the individual who forms the intentions). Likewise, the 
 <italic class="italic">spatially remote</italic> distant risk perceptions can be matched to support for policies, which can be regarded as 
 <italic class="italic">distant on the social dimension</italic> (policies involve strangers and collective action). Importantly, the proposed spontaneous matches would be consistent with the empirically corroborated proposition of Construal Level Theory saying that different dimensions of psychological distance (e.g., social and spatial distance) are related to each other [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. It is therefore plausible that the observed links between the risk perspective and level of implementation are due to a similar level of psychological distance from the individual and, therefore, due to a corresponding level of mental construal.
