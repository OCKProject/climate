<p class="p">Despite the historical development and incontestable differences between mitigation and adaptation, a positive relationship, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">joint endorsement of</italic> (or opposition to) the two strategies, is not implausible. After all, their common goal is to avoid negative consequences for the human and natural environment. If peopleâ€™s endorsements of mitigation and adaptation are guided by a broader perspective that integrates both strategies as a common response to threats associated with climate change, then people who endorse one strategy, for example because they value nature, should also endorse the second strategy.
