<p class="p">We used ten items to assess 
 <italic class="italic">people’s future intentions to engage in behaviours to mitigate</italic> climate change (UK sample) and asked them how likely they were to take these actions. The topics revolved around mobility, energy saving, consumption, and political behaviours. The proposed ten actions formed a reliable scale in the UK survey (α =. 78). For lack of space we could not include this measure in the Swiss survey.
