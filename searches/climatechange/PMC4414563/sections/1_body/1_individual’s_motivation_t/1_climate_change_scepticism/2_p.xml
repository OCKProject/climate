However, it is also plausible that people who are sceptical about the reality and relevance of climate change may endorse adaptation measures. More specifically, if adaptation is understood as a possible future alternative to costly and unnecessary (from a sceptical point of view) mitigation efforts in the present, endorsing adaptation is an excuse for not taking any mitigation actions now [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] (see also [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]). In other words, it is possible that climate change sceptics favour adaptation over mitigation because it allows them to stall and block mitigation efforts.
