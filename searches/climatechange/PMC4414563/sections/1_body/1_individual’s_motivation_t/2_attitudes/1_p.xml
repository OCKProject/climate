<p class="p">Until recently, climate change has almost exclusively been framed as an environmental problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Correspondingly, the general population is well aware that climate change will harm the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] and their attitude towards nature and its protection should play some role in accounting for individual differences in mitigating climate change. Previous research confirms that people with strong pro-environmental attitudes are more likely to mitigate climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Given that people who positively evaluate environmental protection usually also hold positive attitudes towards nature in general [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], we expect the relationship between attitude towards nature and endorsement of mitigation to be positive too.
