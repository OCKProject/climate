<p class="p">The distinction between proximal and distant risk perceptions also warrants some comments with regard to mitigation. One the one hand, the common assumption that an increased sense of proximal risks motivates people to mitigate [

 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] makes intuitive sense. On the other hand, the global scale at which mitigation works [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] suggests that distant risk perceptions could also be positively linked to endorsement of mitigation, especially among people who are 
 <italic class="italic">more</italic> concerned about places at a more distant level than they are about proximal places [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Consistent with this reasoning, one study found that the more farmers were concerned about distant climate change, the more they were willing to adopt new mitigation practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0124843.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Thus, there are theoretical reasons for and against the superiority of proximal risk perceptions over distant risk perceptions as a predictor of mitigation support; moreover, some evidence suggests that distant risk perceptions might be more relevant for motivating mitigation than proximal risk perceptions.
