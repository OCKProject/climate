<p id="Par17" class="p">For rock magnetic measurements, the dried powder samples were transferred to plastic boxes and subsequently compressed and fixed with cotton wool before securely fastening the lid in order to prevent movement of sediment particles during the measurements. The magnetic susceptibility was measured at room temperature with a MFK1-FA magnetic susceptibility meter (AGICO, Brno) and is given as mass-specific susceptibility (χ
 <sub class="sub">lf</sub>), using an alternating field of 200 A/m at 976 Hz measurement frequency. The susceptibility (χ
 <sub class="sub">lf</sub>) depends on the concentration and grain-size distribution of magnetic minerals
