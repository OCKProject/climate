<p id="Par18" class="p">For X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD), bulk samples were air-dried and then crushed and ground manually to powder in an agate mortar with a pestle. The XRD patterns of the bulk samples were collected using a Panalytical X’Pert PRO DY2198 diffractometer at the Laboratory of Geological Process and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences (Wuhan). The instrument was operated at 40 kV and 40 mA with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation. It was measured from 3° to 35° 2θ at a scan rate of 4° 2θ/min and a step size of 0.02° 2θ. Relative abundances of quartz, plagioclase, and orthoclase were estimated semi-quantitatively using the weighting factor method with reference material of corundum
