<p id="Par13" class="p">Magnetic susceptibility (χ
 <sub class="sub">lf</sub>) has been a useful proxy for reconstructing pedogenic histories and paleoclimatic changes in the loess–paleosol sequences of northern China

 <sub class="sub">lf</sub> must be used cautiously as a paleoclimatic proxy in paleosols because of complications related to material sources, moisture regimes, pedogenic weathering intensity, and the presence of lithogenic ferrimagnetic minerals

 <sub class="sub">lf</sub> does not accurately reflect paleoclimatic conditions because of the strong influence of post-depositional hydromorphic processes (i.e., related to the rise and fall of the groundwater table

 </sup>). Although many ferromagnetic minerals contributing to the χ
