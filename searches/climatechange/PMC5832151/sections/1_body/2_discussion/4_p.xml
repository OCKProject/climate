<p id="Par14" class="p">Whereas the Hm/(Hm + Gt) and (Or + Pl)/Q profiles at Jiujiang are consistent in indicating a climate shift from warm/humid to cool/dry conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene, the magnetic susceptibility curve offers an apparently contradictory signal. In the loess-paleosol sections of northern China, higher χ
 <sub class="sub">lf</sub> reflects greater neoformation of fine-grained pedogenic ferrimagnetic particles, which is generally interpreted to represent more highly weathered soils resulting from warmer and more humid climate conditions

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>) thus appears to contradict findings from the Hm/(Hm + Gt) and (Or + Pl)/Q profiles. However, the red earth sediments from southern China have experienced more intense chemical weathering than the loess deposits from northern China

 <sub class="sub">lf</sub> proxy is, in fact, consistent with interpretations of the Hm/(Hm + Gt) and (Or + Pl)/Q data at Jiujiang. The relatively smooth upward changes in these proxies through the lower and middle units indicate that the study area experienced gradual climate change from warm and humid to cooler and drier during the middle to late Pleistocene, and the pronounced oscillations in all three proxies through the upper unit reflect multiple climate cycles since the last interglacial period
