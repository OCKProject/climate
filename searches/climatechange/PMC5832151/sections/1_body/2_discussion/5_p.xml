<p id="Par15" class="p">The existence of multiple climate subcycles with periodicities of ≤100 kyr during the middle and late Pleistocene has been demonstrated by magnetic susceptibility profiles from loess-paleosol sections in northern China (e.g., Luochuan and Xifeng) as well as by δ

 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>), it does not show the same climate subcycles. The smooth pattern of climate change recorded by multiple proxies at Jiujiang between ~390 and 690 ka is due to the intense chemical weathering under warm, humid climate conditions experienced by this section. Consequently, the shorter-term (≤100-kyr) climate signals recorded in the loess-paleosol sections of northern China were overprinted in the red earth sections of southern China, which, thus, do not offer the same degree of paleoclimate detail. The controversies over paleoclimate interpretations of the red earth sediments of southern China are largely the result of use of different paleoclimate proxies in key studies
