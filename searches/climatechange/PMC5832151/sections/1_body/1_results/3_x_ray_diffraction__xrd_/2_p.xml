<p id="Par10" class="p">The main clay minerals in the Jiujiang red earth section are illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite, with trace amounts of mixed-layer kaolinite–smectite and mixed-layer illite–vermiculite, as determined from oriented clay samples in previous XRD studies

 </sup>. Bulk-sample XRD data show that the clay assemblages of the lower and middle units are dominated by illite and kaolinite, whereas the upper unit contains illite, vermiculite, and kaolinite. Under acidic soil-water conditions, high-charge vermiculite can transform into kaolinite via mixed-layer vermiculite-kaolinite

 </sup>. However, the amounts of the two mixed-layer phases in the Jiujiang section are quite low, as shown by an absence of characteristic peaks in bulk-sample XRD traces. The absence of vermiculite in bulk samples from the middle and lower units is due to their more highly weathered condition compared to the upper unit, reflecting warmer and more humid climatic conditions during their formation. Feldspars and vermiculite were more stable under the less intense weathering conditions that prevailed during accumulation of the upper unit. Hence, the clay mineralogy of the Jiujiang red earth section records a major paleoclimate shift from warm/humid to cool/dry conditions during the middle to late Pleistocene.
