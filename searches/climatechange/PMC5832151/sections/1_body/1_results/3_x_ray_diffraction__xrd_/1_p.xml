<p id="Par9" class="p">X-ray diffraction analysis of the Jiujiang red earth section shows that all bulk samples contain similar clay assemblages and other mineral species. The main non-clay minerals are quartz (identified from the 0.425 and 0.333 nm peaks) and minor feldspars (orthoclase and plagioclase identified from the 0.324 and 0.319 nm peaks, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a,b,c</xref>). The absence of other silicates suggests intense chemical weathering conditions since the middle Pleistocene. Feldspars (both orthoclase and plagioclase) have notably higher contents in the upper unit than in the middle and lower units (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), a pattern suggesting decreasing weathering intensity towards the surface of the profile.
