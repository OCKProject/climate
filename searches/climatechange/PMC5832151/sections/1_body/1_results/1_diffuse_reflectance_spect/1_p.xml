<p id="Par7" class="p">In the Jiujiang red earth section, hematite content ranges from 0.04 to 11.16 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, whereas goethite content ranges from 0.03 to 3.78 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The Hm/(Hm + Gt) ratio ranges from 0.01 to 0.98. Based on these proxies, three stages of accumulation of the Jiujiang red earth section can be identified. The lower unit (6.2–14.0 m) contains the highest concentrations of hematite (4.93 to 10.87 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean 9.28 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and the lowest concentrations of goethite (0.20 to 2.85 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean 1.16 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), yielding the highest Hm/(Hm + Gt) ratios (0.75 to 0.98; mean of 0.89). The hematite content in the lower unit (6.2–14.0 m) is relatively stable although with minor fluctuations at depths of 11.4–12.0 m and a larger negative excursion at depths of 13.0–14.0 m. Its goethite content ranges from 0.20 to 2.85 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, with relatively higher content at depths of 11.0–14.0 m (mean 1.27 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The middle unit (3.9–6.2 m) also contains more hematite (6.33 to 11.6 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean 8.46 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) than goethite (0.64 to 1.70 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean 1.14 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), although Hm/(Hm + Gt) ratios (0.81 to 0.91; mean of 0.84) are lower than in the lower unit. Within the middle unit, both the hematite and goethite content decline upsection, although the decline in hematite is relatively greater, imparting a pale yellow to yellowish-brown color to the upper part of this unit. The upper unit (0–3.9 m) exhibits the lowest hematite concentrations (0.04 to 6.43 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean 2.18 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and the highest goethite concentrations (0.03 to 3.78 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; mean of 1.54 g kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), yielding the lowest Hm/(Hm + Gt) ratios (0.01 to 0.94; mean of 0.51). The contents of both hematite and goethite oscillate considerably, and neither proxy exhibits an obvious decreasing or increasing trend upsection. For the Jiujiang section as a whole, goethite content fluctuates more strongly than hematite content, which is relatively stable in the lower and middle units and oscillates only in the upper unit. From the base of the section upward, goethite exhibits an overall increasing trend and hematite a decreasing trend resulting in a pronounced decline in Hm/(Hm + Gt) ratios upsection (Fig.
