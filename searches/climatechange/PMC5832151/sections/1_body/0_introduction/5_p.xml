 </sup>. Therefore, we take it that post-depositional diagenesis played a very weak role in the red earth. The main goal of the present study was to investigate the Fe-oxide mineralogy of the Jiujiang red earth section, with supplementary information from silicate minerals, in order to reveal the paleoclimatic evolution of the middle to lower Yangtze River of southern China during the middle and late Pleistocene.
