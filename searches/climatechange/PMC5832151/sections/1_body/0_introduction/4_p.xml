<p id="Par5" class="p">Pedogenic processes associated with intense chemical weathering produce soil minerals reflecting the prevailing climatic conditions. Iron minerals, in particular, have proven to be powerful tools for reflecting soil formation intensity and paleoclimatic evolution

 </sup>. Goethite and hematite, which have similar thermodynamic stabilities, are the most common Fe oxides in soils. Soil factors such Eh, pH, temperature, and organic matter content influence the formation and stability of goethite and hematite

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. Cooler and wetter conditions promote formation of goethite, which imparts a yellow-brown color to soils, whereas warmer and drier conditions favor hematite
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>. Hematite, especially the fine-grained variety, imparts a reddish color to soils, that masks the yellowish color of goethite
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, the ratio of hematite to goethite (i.e., hematite/(hematite + goethite, or Hm/(Hm + Gt)) is commonly used as a climate proxy in soil studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. However, traditional analytical techniques such as visually measured soil color proxies, X-ray diffraction, and Mössbauer spectrometry are either not sufficiently precise or too time-consuming for determination of hematite and goethite concentrations in large numbers of samples

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. The recent development of diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) has provided a faster, more precise, and nondestructive method of quantification of hematite and goethite in soils

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. The presence of either hematite or goethite can be detected at less than 0.1% in mixtures with other soil minerals

 </sup>. Rock magnetic techniques can also be used to obtain information about pedogenic processes and paleoclimate evolution from iron-oxide assemblages in soils

 </sup>. The most common pedogenic magnetic minerals in red earth sediments of southern China are maghemite, hematite, and goethite, and transformations among them result in variable mineralogic concentrations and magnetic intensities in soils
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, a combination of rock magnetic and spectroscopic techniques can be used to retrieve paleoclimatic information recorded in the Fe-oxide fraction of paleosols
