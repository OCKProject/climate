<p id="Par4" class="p">After deposition, the Yangtze Basin red earth sediments underwent intense chemical weathering under warm and humid climatic conditions, as shown by high Rb/Sr ratios, intense depletion of mobile elements and concentration of immobile elements, as well as the well-developed net-like structure

 </sup>. Although for the past few years the red earth sediments have attracted attention from many researchers in order to reconstruct paleoenvironments and paleoclimates in southern China, the climatic significance of these deposits is still debated. Studies of magnetic susceptibility and stable carbon isotopic compositions demonstrated the existence of eight depositional-pedogenic cycles in the Xiangyang section related to paleoclimatic changes
