<p class="p">The Atlas of projections included in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] shows decrease in the median precipitation in most of Central America under the RCP4.5 scenario. These projections are generated by global climate models with strong agreement among the simulations for Central America. However, most of global climate models available from the CMIP5 have resolutions of about a few hundreds of kilometres and give little spatial detail of the climate changes in the region that features narrow continent, high mountains of steep slopes.

 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] used the MRI-AGCM3.1 model to downscale future scenarios with a global 20-km horizontal resolution model to estimate precipitation extremes. They showed an increase of the consecutive five-day accumulated precipitation exceeding 80% of Central America, which agreed with previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Studies using high resolution downscaling of climate change have shown some added value over the coarser model simulations [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Therefore, the main objectives of this work are to evaluate the high-resolution downscaling simulations over Central America and to assess climate change projections under RCP4.5 scenario. The uncertainty analysis and variability possible in the system are not carried out since this study is based on a single model projection.
