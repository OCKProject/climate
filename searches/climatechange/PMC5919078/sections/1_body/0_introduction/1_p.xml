 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The vulnerability to climate extremes in the region is high due to the strong dependence of the economy on agriculture and hydropower. Smallholder farmers are a vulnerable group in case of extreme changes of climate conditions [
