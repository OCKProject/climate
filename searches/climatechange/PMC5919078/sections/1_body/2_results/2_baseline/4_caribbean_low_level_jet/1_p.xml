<p class="p">The vertical profile of zonal wind is a suitable feature to investigate the model ability to represent atmospheric circulation in Central America. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193570.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref> shows the annual cycle of the vertical profile of mean zonal wind over CLLJ area (80–70°W and 12–16°N) averaged over 1979–2008 period using CFSR reanalysis data [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] and over 1961–1990 period using Eta-8km simulations. The reanalysis shows the strongest jet in July and a secondary maximum in February. April and October are the weakest CLLJ months. This semi-annual feature of CLLJ is consistent with meridional gradient of sea surface temperature and the sea level pressure [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] The Eta-8km is able to capture the CLLJ semi-annual feature. The core of the jet at 925 hPa, with maximum in July and minimum in October, is also well reproduced by the high-resolution simulations. However, Eta-8km simulations show positive bias, about 2 m/s, in zonal wind velocity in comparison with CFSR in the layer between 950 and 900 hPa throughout the year, but show negative bias, about -2 m/s, above 700 hPa in July. The simulated CLLJ is not as deep as in the reanalysis data. The strength of the jet may have resolution dependency, as the errors are even larger when compared against the ERA40, a coarser reanalysis data.
