<p class="p">The changes in CLLJ projected by the Eta model simulations at 8 km are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193570.g012" class="xref">Fig 12</xref>. In general, the climate change causes little impact on the CLLJ. The projections suggest some weakening in the CLLJ in the layer between 1000 hPa and 600 hPa from November to February, and some strengthening in the layer between 800 hPa and 600 hPa from June to August (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193570.g012" class="xref">Fig 12B</xref>). The wind in 925 hPa, where the core of CLLJ is located, weakens during the entire year in these projections for the period 2021â€“2050. However, toward the end of the century, [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] assessed the CLLJ at this same level, 925 hPa, and found strengthening of the winds from May to November based on PRECIS projections for A2 and B2 scenarios. This disagreement in the trends of the CLLJ strength leads to little confidence on the possible changes on the CLLJ. [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] showed using ERA-40 reanalyses that when the CLLJ is strong, precipitation is reduced in the Caribbean Basin. However, the jet is slightly weaker and precipitation in the Caribbean region has reduced in these projections.
