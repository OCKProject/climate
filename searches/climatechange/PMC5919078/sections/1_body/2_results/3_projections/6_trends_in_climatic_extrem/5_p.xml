 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193570.g014" class="xref">Fig 14A</xref> shows the trends in the maximum number of consecutive days per year when ET &lt; = 0.5 ETP. Negative trends are shown for most of the areas in Panamá and Costa Rica and for the Atlantic basin in Nicaragua and Honduras. On the other hand, over Pacific basin in Nicaragua and El Salvador, and most of Belize and Guatemala trends are positive suggesting an increment in water deficit events in these regions. This pattern of trends resembles the pattern of evapotranspiration changes shown by [
 <xref rid="pone.0193570.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In addition, annual mean water excess, P-ET, is shown as a proxy of water availability for runoff in the region. According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193570.g014" class="xref">Fig 14B</xref>, P-ET increases during the 2021–2050 period in the lower parts of the Atlantic basins of Costa Rica, southeast Nicaragua and the Pacific basins of Panamá. [
