  <result pre="disparities [ 19, 20, 21]. In this paper, we illustrate" exact="climate" post="change related risks to the infrastructure of schools and"/>
  <result pre="region. 2. Methods We focused on specific vulnerabilities associated with" exact="climate" post="change and the school built environment and paid particular"/>
  <result pre="schools and student populations. We included search terms that encompassed" exact="climate" post="change, global warming, and resulting extreme weather such as"/>
  <result pre="terms that encompassed climate change, global warming, and resulting extreme" exact="weather" post="such as flooding. We used the terms &quot;school infrastructure"/>
