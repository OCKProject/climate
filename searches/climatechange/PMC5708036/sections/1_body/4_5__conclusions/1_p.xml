<p class="p">We studied the risks that climate change poses to children in schools in U.S. Federal Region 2 and the potential that resilience efforts present to improving overall student and community well-being. The disparities seen at the level of Federal Region 2 are manifest nationally and even more so globally. We emphasize that “It takes roots to weather the storm” by focusing on opportunities to change the context and affect social determinants of health; and we frame response and recovery initiatives by focusing on the concept of resilience through “building back better”. In order to prevent further structural racism and socioeconomic disadvantages, special attention should be on areas prone to climate change related disasters, and on disadvantaged schools and children, as they are more vulnerable to climate change risks. Better surveillance, more research, and federal oversight of environmental factors in schools (specific to climate risks) is necessary, as exposures result in short- and long term negative health effects and climate change risks will increase over time.</p>
