<p class="p">Our investigation also revealed that quality and availability of data on health, environmental risks, and school infrastructure vary significantly by political geography. No systematic indicators for accessing environmental health in schools exist in the U.S. which prevents direct comparisons of indicators between regions. Such indicators could be used for both baseline assessment as well as tracking progress of interventions or impact of policies. Furthermore, we also acknowledge that disparities within a single geographic area could be as much or more than between areas but that investigation was outside the scope of this project. This paper illustrates a starting point and the current landscape on which the need for future research and advocacy can be based.</p>
