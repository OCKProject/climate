<p class="p">While we focused on Federal Region 2 for illustrative purposes, even more differences arise, in exposure to climate change, disparities, existing resilience efforts, maintenance of schools, and ultimately child health when considering the U.S. national level [
 <xref rid="B101-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>]. Such disparities are even greater on a global level [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Inhabitants of islands and people in developing countries are most at risk. In developing countries, school infrastructure is less resilient to climate disasters, putting children even more at risk [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and furthermore, there are important resilience examples from which the U.S could draw [
 <xref rid="B102-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. In addressing the gaps in terms of climate resilient schools, the U.S. therefore has an opportunity to learn from, model, and support such an effort globally.
