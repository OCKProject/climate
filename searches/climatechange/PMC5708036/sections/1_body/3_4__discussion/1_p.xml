<p class="p">We found that climate change worsens existing environmental health issues in schools, presents new challenges and also affords opportunities to implement health promoting opportunities while increasing resilience. The potential health impacts include worsened childhood asthma, cognitive and learning issues, mental health consequences, and missed school days for children and work days for caregivers. The risks of such impacts vary by geographic area based on projected weather and ecological changes secondary to climate change; they vary by school district and individual facility based on baseline condition of the school built environment; the risks vary based on which hazards occur in proximity to the school; and, finally, they vary based on existing resource disparities across communities resulting from on-going structural inequalities and chronic low prioritization of these issues. The examples of emerging resilience underscore our finding that, with careful planning, disasters themselves can serve as opportunities to become more resilient to the risks posed by climate change and to improve overall student well-being and school performance. Specifically, we observed that rates of underlying childhood disease and risk factors and condition of school infrastructure vary both within and between jurisdictions, highlighting the need for local vulnerability to environmental exposures to also be used in prioritizing adaptations.</p>
