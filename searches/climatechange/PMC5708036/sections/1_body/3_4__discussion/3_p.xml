<p class="p">In Region 2, and in the U.S., different organizations offer guidelines for protecting children’s health in schools, but such guidelines and programs are voluntary and not mandated. Our findings further support the recommendations made by Barnett and Paulson [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and the American Academy of Pediatrics [
 <xref rid="B100-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">100</xref>], stating a federal/national environmental public health agency should have the authority and budget to establish a program addressing children’s environmental health, covering school environmental health, which allows for research of climate-associated health effects, supports education and awareness of school environmental health issues, promotes sustainable energy use, and supports development of local adaptation strategies. The health sector, representatives across federal agencies (for example, US EPA, CDC/NCEH, NIEHS, FEMA, DHHS, HUD), parents and mental health advocates should all be included in this agency. Such a strategy can have co-benefits on health in the short- and long term.
