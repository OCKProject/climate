<p class="p">According to the World Health Organization, children, people living in megacities, and people living on islands, are most at risk of health effects from a host of climate-related changes in extreme weather. Children going to school in PR, USVI or NYC and other megacities are particularly vulnerable [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01397-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) due to differences in baseline climate, resources, demographics, population density, local ecology, and geographic terrain, climate change in general will bring greater risk of heavier storm events and resultant flooding and property damage separated by hotter and drier periods [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. New York and New Jersey could see significantly shortened winters by the end of the century with a shift toward rain instead of snow in previously snowy regions. Most climate models also predict longer periods of extreme heatâ€”a condition that is further intensified by the urban heat island effect [
