<p class="p">We identified only three national level studies that assessed school building infrastructure in the last three decades, none of which provided data for U.S. entities outside of the 50 states. In a 1995 U.S. General Accounting Office study, more than half of U.S. K-12 public schools reported at least one building feature needing extensive repair with HVAC and plumbing being the most frequently reported; and almost two thirds reported at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor with acoustics for noise control, ventilation, and physical security being the most reported factors [

A 2014 study by the U.S. Department of Education showed that infrastructure problems still affect the majority of school buildings and their outdoor facilities. These findings for the Northeast region were consistent with the national averages. The same study indicated that nationally 99% of K-12 public schools and 100% in the Northeast have at least some permanent buildings of which the average building age is 44 years, and 31% of schools nationally while only 12% within the Northeast have portable buildings [

Most recently, a 2016 report by the non-profit 21st Century School Fund found an annual underinvestment of $46 billion to assure a healthy and safe environment in K-12 public schools. Over the period 1994â€“2013, New Jersey and New York ranked in the top three of U.S. states on spending for maintenance and operation of school facilities measured per student ($1923 and $1759 respectively) and per square foot. These figures included the combined costs for utilities, routine maintenance, cleaning, minor repairs, and security [
