<p class="p">Regarding the USVI, a 2013 assessment of K12 public school buildings and classrooms for US Insular Areas (Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and USVI) reported that the total costs of deferred maintenance in K-12 public schools on the Virgin Islands are about $66.2 million and that the average age of school buildings was 40 years (consistent with the national average noted above) [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The report assigned facility scores to the public schools on a scale from 1 to 5; the USVI had an overall score of 3.6, comparable to the other areas assessed. Key problems in the USVI include corroding rebar, spalled concrete, deteriorated wood elements, weatherproofing, air quality concerns, plumbing leaks, exposed electrical elements, vehicle circulation, emergency vehicle access, fire protections (including fire hydrant provision), and site drainage. Facility items that should be standard but were missing from at least some of the school buildings in the USVI include: PA system, fire alarm, fire hydrants, backflow preventer, emergency vehicle access, fences, and gates. Additional site concerns consisted of site drainage and flooding problems and poor condition of asphalt and pavements.
