<p class="p">School location in relation to the surrounding properties’ current and historical use is an important consideration as well. Outdoor air, water, and soil quality can be influenced by Superfund sites, solid waste landfills and transfer stations, active industrial sites, and other chemical storage sites located proximal to schools [

 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Many schools are located adjacent to toxic sites that represent potential hazardous exposures, particularly in extreme weather conditions. Notably in the U.S., there are over 12,000 so called “fenceline” schools that are within one mile of high-risk industrial facilities using or storing large quantities of toxic chemicals (i.e., those involved in the Risk Management Program). These schools serve nearly 1 in 10 school children. In New York, 2.8% of the population is living in one of the fenceline communities, a relatively small percentage compared to other states in the US. In New Jersey, 4% of the total population is living in a fenceline community. Poor, Black children (age &lt; 12) are 2.5 times more likely (compared to white children not in poverty) to live in a fenceline community and Black children overall are 1.4 times more likely to attend a public school in a fenceline community. In New York, poor Black children are 1.7 times more likely to live in a fenceline community [
