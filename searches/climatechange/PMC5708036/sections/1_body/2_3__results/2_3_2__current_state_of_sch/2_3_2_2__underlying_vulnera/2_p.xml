<p class="p">Another key vulnerability factor is poverty and the underlying health status of children which affects their susceptibility to environmental exposures. Poverty rates—represented by children eligible for free lunch—vary highly across the different geographic regions with Puerto Rico having the highest rate at &gt;90% of children [

And, furthermore, high prevalence of underlying student illnesses and vulnerable school location can compound each other when disasters occur. When Hurricane Floyd struck the eastern U.S. coast in 1999, low income schools serving a majority of Black students had twice the risk of being flooded compared to majority non-Black, non-low income schools. The authors of that study posited that the root causes of this increased risk dated back to post-Civil War when Black families settled in the less desirable, often lower lying and flood-prone land and that such inequality was perpetuated by subsequent racial segregation laws. Flooding and resulting mold risk posed a particular risk to the students in these schools given the high rates of respiratory illness [
