 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-01397-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>. Activities that target an individual (represented by the top of the pyramid) take considerable effort while affecting the smallest portion of the population. Conversely, efforts targeting social determinants of health (the base of the pyramid) have greater implications for a population. If the analogy is a tree instead of a pyramid, those actions that affect the social determinants of health are strengthening the roots.
