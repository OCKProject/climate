<p class="p">In U.S. Federal Region 2 and beyond, current initiatives suggest reforming the financial structure of preparedness and response to better address these root causes. “Re-focus”, a group of social-entrepreneurs, suggests a new link between catastrophe bonds and insurance coverage which results in “resilience bonds”.

More traditional funding mechanisms such as grants for financing healthy school environments are compiled for reference by the EPA [
