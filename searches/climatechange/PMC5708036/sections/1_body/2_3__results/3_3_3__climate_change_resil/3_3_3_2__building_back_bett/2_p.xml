<p class="p">At the national level, two key guidance documents create a road map for recovery that includes an emphasis on health: the National Disaster Recovery Framework (NDRF) and the National Academies report on Communities after Disasters. The NDRF is “a guide that enables effective recovery support to disaster-impacted States, Tribes, Territorial and local jurisdictions” [

Also at the national level, FEMA provides grants that fund recovery activities beyond the immediate disaster response period and a design guidance document that complements community level efforts to restore school function post-disasters and improve the baseline vulnerable functionality [

Furthermore, there are national networks, non-profits, and other civil sector organizations, such as the Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units (PEHSU), US EPA Office of Children’s Health Protection, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Environmental Health, Collaborative for High Performance Schools, and Healthy Schools Network, Inc., that have considerable expertise and are poised to serve in an advisory capacity regarding child health and safety in schools after disasters [
