<p class="p">We focused on specific vulnerabilities associated with climate change and the school built environment and paid particular attention to specific geographic regions, and resilience efforts related to schools. Databases included Pubmed and Scopus to capture literature from the biomedical, environmental health, and educational fields. In addition to specific search engines, our search also included a snowballing strategy using the references from some of the cornerstone reports and peer-reviewed literature relevant to our cross-disciplinary topic. We referenced empirical studies, review articles, commentaries, news articles, and organizational reports to obtain information on schools and student populations. We included search terms that encompassed climate change, global warming, and resulting extreme weather such as flooding. We used the terms “school infrastructure OR school built environment” to find references relevant to the permanent school buildings, temporary structures such as mobile trailers, playgrounds, other facilities essential for school functioning or where students spend time such as athletic fields, and routes to and from school.</p>
