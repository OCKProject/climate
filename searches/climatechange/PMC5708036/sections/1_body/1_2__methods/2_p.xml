<p class="p">School statistics were obtained by using most recent datasets from National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). However, as most national datasets do not include data on Puerto Rico and the USVI, we used grey literature, governmental websites, Google, and Google Scholar to cast a broader search net. Search terms included phrases such as “school maintenance OR school safety hazards OR climate resilience AND Puerto Rico OR US Virgin Islands” as well as “school resilience,” “building back better,” and “schools after hurricanes.” We further focused on the climate related risks of extreme weather and sea level rise that have specific impact on school infrastructure, noting that there are many climate change associated environmental implications, such as shifting insect habitat. An additional climate change risk is that of extreme heat which is of particular concern for student athletes [

 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Given that the risks of extreme heat are well documented [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-01397" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], we chose to highlight less addressed climate change risks, and, thus, mention the risk of increased temperatures only minimally in this manuscript.
