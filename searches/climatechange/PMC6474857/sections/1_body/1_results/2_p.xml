<p id="Par11" class="p">The assessment of extinction risks revealed that the Bornmuelleri clade is most at risk (i.e. Threat 2) as it is projected to lose 97% of its AOO by 2070 under RCP 8.5. For the Raddei and Xanthina clades the highest risk was projected to be categorized as Threat 3 (78% and 64% range loss, respectively; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) by 2070 under RCP 8.5. Regarding range gain statistics, we also found that the Bornmuelleri clade exhibited a complete absence of gaining newly suitable habitats (percent gain = 0) under any future climate scenario, whilst the Xanthina group was projected to gain the highest proportion of newly suitable habitats (10–11%; Fig.
