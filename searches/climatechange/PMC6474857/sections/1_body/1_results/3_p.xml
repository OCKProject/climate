<p id="Par12" class="p">The results from the landscape analysis showed a decreasing trend in the extent and number of patches projected to remain climatically suitable for all 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> clades. While, the decreasing trend in the number of patches for the Xanthina clade was low, the decreasing trend of the average patch size was striking for this group (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). Also, both the patch isolation (i.e. aggregation index) and the patch fragmentation (i.e. splitting index) showed increasing trends from current to projected future climates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). This was particularly the case for the mountain-dwelling clades Bornmuelleri and Raddei, which in turn were reasonably consistent with their projected altitudinal upward shifts (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
