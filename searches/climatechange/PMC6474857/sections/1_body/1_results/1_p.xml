<p id="Par10" class="p">The ecological niche models revealed that suitable habitats of mountain vipers, particularly those of the Bornmuelleri and Raddei clades are patchily spread in mountain ranges under current climates. For the Bornmuelleri clade these areas mainly stretched along the Anatolian diagonal and along two mountainous landscape parallel to the Mediterranean Sea, Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon Mountain. Suitable habitats for the Raddei clade were found in the highlands of the Zagros and Alborz mountains within Iran, and in Ararat and Lesser Caucasus in Turkey and Armenia. For the Xanthina clade the predicted suitable habitats were stretched close to coastal lowlands of the Mediterranean Sea in Turkey. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) and true skill statistics (TSS) values of the 10-fold replicated split-sample tests showed excellent prediction accuracy, as all models revealed an average AUC &gt; 0.8 (except the SRE model for Bornmuelleri and Xanthina) and an average TSS &gt; 0.6 among replicates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Among the four algorithms, GBM presented the highest and SRE the lowest model accuracies, both for AUC and TSS. Highest model accuracies were generally obtained for the Raddei clade. The AUC of the consensus models of the Bornmuelleri, Raddei, and Xanthina clades were 0.925, 0.939 and 0.911, respectively, and the according TSS values were 0.786, 0.825 and 0.733. The consensus distributions of all three 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> clades indicated a continuous pattern of range contraction (reduction in projected AOO) under changing climates during the twenty-first century (from the current to 2050 and to 2070) and for RCP scenarios (from RCP 4.5 to RCP 8.5) (see Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> for the three species and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The extent of range shifts was quite consistent and similar under the two dispersal scenarios, i.e. no and unlimited dispersal, hence we focused on the no dispersal range changes hereafter. However, the magnitude and direction of range changes vary by clade and emission scenario, with the Bornmuelleri clade showing the highest and the Xanthina group representing the lowest loss in projected AOO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). As we expected, range contractions increase over time and under the more severe emissions scenarios. Accordingly, the extent of projected AOO would get the least reduction by 2050 and using RCP 4.5 (34.6%, 52.1% and 77.6% for the Xanthina, Raddei and Bornmuelleri clades, respectively), while the highest reduction was found under the severe scenario, RCP 8.5 by 2080 (63.8%, 78.3% and 96.8% for Xanthina, Raddei and Bornmuelleri, respectively; Table
