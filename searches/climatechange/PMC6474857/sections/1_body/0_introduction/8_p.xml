<p id="Par9" class="p">The restricted current distribution ranges and small population sizes of all 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> species, and the ongoing threats from climate change urge for an assessment of their vulnerability and for developing conservation priorities in response to projected climate trends. Here, we assess the risks of mountain vipers to lose habitat from climate change in a hotspot of the Palearctic herpetofauna. More specifically, we address the following questions: (1) how could projected climate change affect the area of suitable habitat (AOO) in mountain vipers; (2) to what degree could projected climate change affect patch connectivity and isolation; and (3) how do these changes affect the IUCN risk assessment criteria of mountain vipers. To answer these questions, we used ENM to derive climatically suitable habitats as an index of currently occupied areas (AOO) of 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> genus in the eastern Mediterranean climatic regime (Irano-Anatoly and the southern Caucasus). We then removed anthropogenically converted land areas from the modelled habitats and measured projected shifts and/or shrinkages of the AOO to assess current and forthcoming extinction risks of the species under future climates. By using landscape ecology analyses, we further assessed the projected long-term persistence of the species complexes through tracking the spatial configuration of suitable habitats.
