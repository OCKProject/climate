<p id="Par5" class="p">Generally, the IUCN assessment of the Red List status relies on published data and on expert knowledge about distribution, population status and ecology of species. A trait-based assessment, which aimed at identifying the important species characteristics associated with high risk of extinction due to climate change

 <italic class="italic">occupied area</italic>’ (total area of all occupied patches) as being the most sensitive characteristic. The terms ‘
 <italic class="italic">extent of occurrence</italic>’ (EOO) and ‘
 <italic class="italic">area of occupancy</italic>’ (AOO) are two metrics representative of a species’ geographic range (i.e. occupied areas), and are used to assess extinction risks and the Red List status of species (criteria B in the IUCN Red List). Moreover, as the IUCN recommends that either the known, inferred or projected sites of occurrence could be used to estimate the species range

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>, predicting suitable range for the species based on their ecological requirements through an ecological niche modelling (ENM) procedure is a highly suitable tool for conservation assessments. Consequently, ENM (also habitat suitability or species distribution modelling) has widely been used to estimate EOO and AOO, considering the total number and extent of grid cells predicted to provide suitable habitat for a target species
