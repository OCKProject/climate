 </sup> estimated that 18â€“35% of the analyzed species are at risk of losing significant suitable habitat by 2050. A review on ecological and evolutionary responses of biodiversity to recent changes in climate has concluded that range-restricted species (e.g. polar and mountain-dwelling species) are the first group to respond with highest observed extinction rates in response to climate change
