 </sup>. While range shift can be attributed to poleward latitudinal range displacements, as is a case for species inhabiting extensive geographic areas, the range shrinkage often occurs in range-restricted species, often inhabiting mountains, and results from upward altitudinal range contractions

 </sup>. The result of projections under GCMs and emissions scenarios in our study revealed a consistent response of mountain vipers in terms of range contractions, originating from an altitudinal shift to higher elevations (Tables

The Bornmuelleri clade was projected to lose almost all suitable habitats under the RCP 8.5 by 2070. From a geographic and geomorphologic point of view, the remaining suitable habitats in this clade, which are projected to shift towards a warm Mediterranean climate regime, consist of mountainous landscapes close to flat coastal areas.
