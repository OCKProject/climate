 </sup>. Here, by using metrics of patch configuration, we incorporated the concept of landscape integrity to assess the impact of climate change on the capacity for dispersal and long-term resistance of the species. Furthermore, we eliminated areas that are unsuitable because of human land transformation as extracted from a human footprint dataset. This allowed us to incorporate human-induced barriers into our landscape integrity analysis and increased the realism in projections to the landscape scale. Our approach demonstrated that significant proportions of climatically suitable habitats of mountain vipers are both inaccessible and/or highly fragmented due to the dominance of humanized developments. The decline in both the extent and number of suitable habitat patches was consistent among all species, with the Raddei clade showing a lower decrease in the number of patches compared to the Xanthina and Bornmuelleri clades, although its suitable habitat range was highly reduced (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>). We thus conclude that the currently suitable habitat patches for the latter two groups will likely become too small for supporting viable populations in the future, as they will lose many of these small marginal patches. For the former, the currently suitable habitat represents core patches that will still remain suitable in the future, albeit losing extent.
