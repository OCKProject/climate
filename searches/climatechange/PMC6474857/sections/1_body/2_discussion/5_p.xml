 </sup>. The finer the scale at which the distribution of species is mapped, the larger will be the area within which the taxon is recorded to be absent, and the more likely the assessed extinction risks will be higher. Conversely, coarse-resolution mapping of species distributions fails to map unoccupied areas, resulting in lower assessed extinction risks. Moreover, mapping species at coarse resolution increases the likelihood of neglecting environmental heterogeneity and hidden local microclimatic refugia, particularly in mountain areas

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>
 </sup>. The assessment of climate change impacts and extinction risks is thus scale-dependent, with finer spatial scales usually being more representative of a species’ biology than coarse resolution assessments. In our study, the ensemble models were developed at a relatively fine grid size (ca. 1 km
