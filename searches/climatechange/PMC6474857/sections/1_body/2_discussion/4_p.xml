<p id="Par16" class="p">The configuration-isolation indices (i.e. AI and SI; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a,b</xref>) revealed that mountain vipers will be facing an extreme rate of degradation in habitat quality due to increased isolation and fragmentation under projected future climates. The decrease in the aggregation index is caused by increased distance among subpopulations which is the primary factor of reduced connectivity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>
 </sup>. The impact of climate change on connectivity is more deteriorating for range-restricted species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> species, as their population dynamics is suffering from their strongly-limited dispersal behaviors
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>
 </sup>. In addition to isolation, mountain vipers’ suitable ranges are increasingly subdivided into smaller patches under projected future warming, which in turn will increase their vulnerability to climate change. Generally, species’ vulnerability to environmental stress is thought to depend on three main elements: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>
 </sup>. In the case of mountain vipers, the high magnitude of range loss due to climate change (i.e. exposure
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>
 </sup>) and human-induced barriers to connectivity impose high levels of vulnerability. Mountain vipers are ecological specialists distributed among isolated populations, thus exhibiting a patchy distribution. Their reduced population sizes and life histories exhibiting long generations limit their adaptive capacity to changing climates (i.e. sensitivity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>
 </sup>), which additionally intensify their vulnerability to changing climates. Finally, ongoing trailing-edge fragmentation, limited dispersal capability, lack of gene flow between disjunct populations and low effective population size due to declining population trends all lead to likely low genetic diversity within populations (i.e. adaptive capacity
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup>) which adds again to the vulnerability of mountain vipers to climate change. Given the reduction in the projected AOO of the PGMCs we then assigned them to Threat levels (see Methods for more details on Threat levels). Of the three PGMCs, Bornmuelleri is at highest risk to go extinct and would be classified as IUCN Threat 2, but very close to critically threatened (Threat 1) supported by projections of all GCM models. Overall, the uncertainty in range loss values due to the different climate change models that we considered was very low (SD = 3.8–9.2% for Raddei, SD = 1.1–9.7% for Bornmuelleri, SD = 3.2–12.26% for Xanthina) leading to all three groups being assigned into only one threat level. There are additional drivers that could intensify the risk of species extinctions. For example, catastrophic events such as climate extremes, pathogens, large fires or spread of invasive organisms, although occurring at a low or unpredictable frequency, may impose severe consequences and irreversible effects
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>
 </sup>. Increasing human pressure and land use change, which have been intensifying particularly in the eastern Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup> are important threats to the connectivity of the 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic>’s remnant populations. In addition to habitat destruction, land use degradation hampers the effective efficiency of mountain vipers to track climate change and hence increases the vulnerability of these species. The species have to disperse to areas that are becoming newly suitable under climate change. If populations cannot disperse at the velocity of environment shifts, the species may only persist in remaining refugia
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>
 </sup>. The capability to disperse across landscapes may be further reduced by human developments that dissect suitable habitats into isolated patches, thus reducing habitat connectivity and increasing barriers to dispersal
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>
 </sup>. Altogether, the likely fact that most species will not be able to balance their distributional dynamics with the velocity of environmental changes (e.g. future climate change), highlights the necessity of considering ‘assisted migration’ as an adaptive conservation strategy
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, regarding the recent decline in natural populations of some of the 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">M. latifii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. wagneri</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">ex situ</italic> conservation, for example captive breeding and introduction-reintroduction programs, could be considered as a strategy to assist the long-term persistence of the species in areas that are highly sensitive to climate changes.
