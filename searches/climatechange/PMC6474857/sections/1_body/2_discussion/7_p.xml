 </sup>. Due to the lack of demographic data, we were not able to construct more dynamic models (e.g. mechanistic models), and we focused on projections of AOO as a proxy of effective habitat loss. Our results thus need to be considered with caution. However, our model-derived estimates of AOO could be useful to design conservation areas
