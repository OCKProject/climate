<p id="Par23" class="p">To track the impact of climate change on the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> clades we conducted ENM based on climatic variables at a ~1 km resolution derived from WorldClim

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>
 </sup>. We only used climate variables rather than other vegetation-derived predictors in the ENM analysis in order to assess changes of the climatic suitability and to avoid circular reasoning, as vegetation properties themselves depend on climate. In order to sample the whole study area for background contrast, we allocated 10,000 pseudo-absences spatially at random. We then extracted the values of all 19 bioclim variables for presence and pseudo-absence points and calculated the degree of multicollinearity among them based on the variance inflation factor (VIF). To do so, we used the ‘
 <italic class="italic">usdm</italic>’ package
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>
 </sup> and set a VIF value of 6 and a correlation threshold of 0.75, as recommended by Guisan, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.

 </sup>. As a result, we retained 6 bioclim variables for modelling, including annual mean temperature (bio1), temperature seasonality (bio4), maximum temperature in the warmest month (bio5), annual precipitation (bio12), precipitation of driest month (bio14) and precipitation seasonality (bio15).
