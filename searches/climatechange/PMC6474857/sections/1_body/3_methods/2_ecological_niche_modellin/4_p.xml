<p id="Par26" class="p">To track changes in suitable habitats we calculated the percentage of cells that gained or lost climatic suitability for the four GCM models, for the two RCPs, and for 2050 and 2070, compared to the current area of suitable habitat for each PGMC. To identify suitable cells from unsuitable ones, we first converted continuous ensemble models into binary presence/absence maps based on the minimum habitat suitability score at occurrence points per PGMC as a threshold. Using this approach, we calculated the Minimal Predicted Area (MPA), a minimum area where the species is projected to exist

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>
 </sup>, for establishing the potential AOO for all clades. For this step, we assumed that all current occurrence points represent suitable habitat condition for the species and we did not remove marginal occurrences as “unsuitable”. Then, based on the number of pixels gained or lost under future climatic scenarios we calculated the respective changes in projected AOO (i.e. range shifts) of the groups. We analysed shifts in suitable habitats by employing two different dispersal scenarios, i.e. unlimited dispersal and no dispersal as two extremes (for more details on dispersal scenarios see reference number
