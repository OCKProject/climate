 </sup>. Threat levels are assigned based on the projected AOO losses, with 1: 100%, 2: &lt;100% and &gt; = 80%, 3: &lt;80% and &gt; = 50%, and 4: &lt;50% and &gt; = 30%. Finally, we assessed the spatial configuration of the suitable habitats of the clades by borrowing landscape ecology metrics that express facilitation or suppression of dispersal and long-term persistence of the clades. To do so, we calculated the number of patches (NP), the proportion of the landscape (PL), the aggregation index (AI), and the splitting index (SI) of suitable habitat patches under current and projected future climates. AI is a metric of spatial adjacency and demonstrates the frequency at which different pairs of patches appear side-by-side in a landscape

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>
 </sup>. The more clumped and compact the patches, the higher are the values of AI. SI measures the degree of fragmentation and can be interpreted as the number of patches with a constant size when the landscape is subdivided into S patches, where S is the value of the splitting index

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">95</xref>
 </sup>. SI increases as the landscape is increasingly subdivided into smaller patches. All metrics were calculated using the ‘
 <italic class="italic">SDMTools</italic>’ R package. A more detailed description of the metrics is available in McGarigal,
