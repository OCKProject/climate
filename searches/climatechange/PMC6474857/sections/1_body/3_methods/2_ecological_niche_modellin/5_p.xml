<p id="Par27" class="p">To obtain an accurate prediction of suitable habitats and to avoid inaccessible areas being identified as suitable for mountain vipers, such as developed areas, we masked these human transformed areas from climatically suitable habitats. Accordingly, we also incorporated the human landscape context into suitability projections. We identified developed areas based on the human footprint model developed and implemented by Sanderson

 </sup>. This layer incorporates data on population density and the presence of infrastructures including road networks, land transformation and human access with pixel values ranging from zero (undeveloped) to 100 (cities and highly developed areas). For our study, we assigned areas with values greater than 50 as developed areas and masked them from the predicted habitat suitability maps. We admit that these humanized areas will expand in the future. Yet, due to the lack of available data for future conditions, the mask was applied unchanged to the future climate scenarios. However, urban growth and change in developed areas might not severely alter the results given the large spatial scale of our analyses.
