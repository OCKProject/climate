 </sup> for two time periods of 2050 (average for 2041–2060) and 2070 (average for 2061–2080). Using four different GCMs allowed us to assess the uncertainty from selecting GCMs as these differ clearly among regions

 </sup>. For each GCM, we considered two representative concentration pathways (RCPs), namely RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. To obtain a final ENM projection, we averaged the ensemble rasters arising from projecting the ENMs to the four GCMs for both scenarios and for the two time periods. Data for bioclim variables based on the four GCMs scenarios and time periods were downloaded from WorldClim at a ~1 km resolution. For each PGMC, we therefore implemented 640 projections (4 ENM algorithms × 10 replications × 4 GCMs × 2 RCPs × 2 time-periods).
