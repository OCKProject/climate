<p id="Par22" class="p">Mountain vipers have a highly isolated distribution with incompletely sampled data. Hence, the insufficient data of the species occurrence is too sparse for performing ENMs at the species level. By lumping occurrence points of the closely related sister-clades we developed niche models above species level

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>
 </sup> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), which subdivides the genus into geographically well-separated clades, we divided the current Mediterranean distribution of the genus into three phylogeographic 
 <italic class="italic">Montivipera</italic> clades (PGMC). These PGMCs represent three different bioregions including coastal habitats (western Turkey), nearshore mountain habitats (southern Turkey, Lebanon, and Syria) and inland mountainous habitats (northern and western Iran and southern Caucasus), which encompass the core area of the distribution of the three phylogenetic clades Xanthina, Bornmuelleri, and Raddei, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a,b</xref>). The ENM analyses were performed such that all occurrences were pooled by PGMCs for further modelling in order to have sufficient observations to build models, obtaining 37, 80 and 35 occurrence points for Bornmuelleri, Raddei and Xanthina clades, respectively. However, we removed the Taurus occurrences of the Xanthina sub-clade because of its more mountainous distribution compared to the rest of the Xanthina sub-clade (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>).
