<p id="Par20" class="p">The study area encompasses parts of the eastern Mediterranean Basin, extends to the Near and Middle East and contains two biodiversity hotspots, the Mediterranean Basin and the Caucasus, which are both rich in endemics from a faunal and also from a floristic viewpoint. From a geomorphologic viewpoint, the study area is predominantly mountainous with a small coastal fringe in the west to an increasing alpine system stretching towards the east, starting from the Taurus Mountain in Turkey and ending with the Lesser Caucasus in Armenia and with the Alborz and Zagros Mountains in Iran. Although this region mainly receives its humidity and rainfall from the Mediterranean Sea, long dry seasons have caused the formation of a heterogeneous mixture of sclerophyllous cover types spanning from alpine steppe grasslands to mixed and deciduous wood-forest belts dominated by oaks, junipers, and pines.</p>
