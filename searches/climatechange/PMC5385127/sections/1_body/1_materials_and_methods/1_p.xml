<p class="p">Projecting future climate on a global scale is an exceptionally complex task given the number of processes and interactions that occur in the biotic and abiotic environment. Despite the challenges, Global Circulation Models (GCMs) continue to be refined and offer projected climate based on various modelled assumptions about those processes and interactions. The most recent suite of models follow the Coupled Model Inter Comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) framework and differ from their predecessors, in part, in their use of Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Each of the RCPs represents a potential future trajectory of the principle forcing agents (measured in W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) driving climatic change. In simplified terms RCP2.6 represents a “peak-and-decline” scenario where radiative forces peak by mid century and decline by 2100. Both RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 are scenarios where stabilization of radiative forces occur by 2100, while in RCP8.5, these forces continue to increase beyond 2100 (

Specific climate models were chosen where projections were available for each of the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5. Selected climate models included the BCC-CSM1.1, CCSM4, GFDL-EMS2G and ISPL-CM5A-LR (
