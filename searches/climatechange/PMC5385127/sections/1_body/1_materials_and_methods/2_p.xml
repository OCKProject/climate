We computed daily mean as (minimum + maximum)/2. Data were averaged over thirty-year time spans such that three time periods 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069) and 2080s (2070–2099) were produced. Each simulation began with 10 fecund females introduced on the date for which temperature would break reproductive diapause (18 °C). The fruit development index which controls the rate at which fruit reaches maturity was set to 4.0 and fruit was available at maximum quality for 50 days before beginning to decline. Although multiple harvests per year were not included in these simulations, the model does account for the availability of wild hosts (
