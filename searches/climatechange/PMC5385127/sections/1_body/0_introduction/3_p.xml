<p class="p">As with most insects, temperature is among the critical factors influencing 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> population size and consequently infestation potential. Several laboratory studies have highlighted the role of temperature in development and mortality and as such baseline physiological data is available. For example, 
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ryan et al. (2016)</xref> found that mortality thresholds occurred at 5 °C (lower) and 35 °C (upper), that no adult eclosion occurred at temperatures less than 8.1 °C or above 30.9 °C and that optimal temperatures for development and reproductive output occurred at 28.2 °C and 22.9 °C respectively. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tochen et al. (2014)</xref> found the optimal rate of population growth at 22 °C and development rates occurred at minimal, optimal and maximal temperatures of 13.4 °C, 21.0 °C, and 29.3 °C respectively.
