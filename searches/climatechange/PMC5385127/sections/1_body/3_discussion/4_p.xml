<p class="p">Although it is standard practice to average temperatures over larger time spans when using climate model data, the averaged data dampens short-term drops or spikes in temperature that might adversely affect population sizes. As such, the simulation results presented herein offer insight into the average potential for growth but do not highlight the extent of inter-annual variation that may occur. To illustrate the effect of using mean temperature data with this model in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">Figs. 7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-7" class="xref">7B</xref> we show a set of population curves for the historic temperature profiles (annual temperatures from 1993 to 2013). We also show the average of the population curves and the population when the simulation is run using the average temperatures over the 20-year time period. In some cases, such as with Hillsborough Florida, averaging the temperatures creates a near-optimal profile by greatly reducing the number of days where temperatures are either too high or too low to support development. The resulting population is larger than any of the individual observed temperature profiles would otherwise suggest. Conversely averaging the temperatures at Fraser Valley, British Columbia, results in a profile where most days are well below optimal growth temperatures. The individual historic temperature profiles, while more variable than the mean, offer the population more opportunity for growth. The resulting population from the averaged temperature profile is significantly smaller than most of the individual profiles.
