<p class="p">As we cannot know 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> which of the climate models will produce the most accurate temperature projections, we combined the results to form ‘consensus maps’ (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Simulated population totals (all life stages) were normalized across the entire data set, and means were generated per corresponding RCP and timeframe (i.e., these are averages of the results of the 
 <italic class="italic">D. suzukii</italic> model, run for the different climate models). From these consensus maps, we see that the 2020s have the potential for the most extensive high-population distribution across southern Canada and much of the continental United States. Northern Canada and regions occupied by the Rocky Mountains have relatively low populations due to lower temperatures that discourage development and encourage mortality. Similarly, the southern extent of the United States has relatively low populations due to excessively high temperatures. There is a noticeable shift in population distribution moving to the 2050s as the central US becomes warmer and populations decline. Some northern central regions in Canada increase in population as temperatures become more favourable. These trends continue into the 2080s as the central and northern US become too warm, central Canada becomes warmer and the most favourable conditions in North America are located primarily to the north-eastern and western US as well as a few regions in southern Canada. While there is little qualitative difference between the model output in the RCP scenarios for the 2020 temperature projections, by the 2080s there is an evident decline in relative population levels in RCP 8.5.
