<p class="p">We employed systematic review methods to document and characterize adaptation initiatives being undertaken across Canada, with methods varying by, and adapted to, jurisdiction. The approach builds upon emerging research in the adaptation tracking field, which seeks to identify and characterize the current status of adaptation and measure progress over time [

 <xref rid="B62-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. To identify federal-level adaptation initiatives, we conducted a systematic web search, reviewed Canada’s sixth national communication (NC6) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and conducted snowball searching. We developed the following search string tailored for Google web searches: 
 <italic class="italic">(“climate change” OR “global warming” OR “climatic change”) health (adaptation OR adaption OR ~adapting OR ~coping OR response OR ~responding) (Canada OR Canadian OR “gc.ca”).</italic> We examined the first 30 search results, then examined every other result after the first 30 until we had reached 30 consecutive irrelevant results, adapted from Panic &amp; Ford [

To track provincial and territorial health adaptation we used keyword searches on their respective Ministry of Health, Ministry of Environment, and Climate Change Department (where applicable) websites. At the local level we searched for evidence of health adaptation in Canada’s six largest municipalities (population &gt;1 million inhabitants) and in each municipality’s encompassing regional health authority (or equivalent). Under Canada’s health care system regional health authorities are responsible for health care delivery at the sub-provincial or sub-territorial level. To track municipal and regional health authority adaptation initiatives we used keyword searches on their respective websites. We conducted searches in French in jurisdictions where relevant. We developed inclusion and exclusion criteria for health adaptation documents (see
