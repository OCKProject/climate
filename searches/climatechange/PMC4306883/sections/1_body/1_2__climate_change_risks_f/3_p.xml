<p class="p">Climate change is expected to increase exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through UV dose, exposure duration and ozone depletion, particularly in northern Canada [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. One study found the highest projected increases in ozone concentrations for Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg, as well as large increases in Alberta near the oil sands developments [

Wildfires are currently responsible for one third of all PM emissions in Canada, and are increasing in frequency, duration and season length, contributing to heart and respiratory illnesses [
