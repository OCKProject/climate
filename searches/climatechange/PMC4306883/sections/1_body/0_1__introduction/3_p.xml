<p class="p">The approach of various levels of government in Canada to adaptation has been described as a “multi-level mosaic”, loosely connected and emerging spontaneously [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Responsibility for adaptation remains unclear and is divided between the federal government, its 10 provinces and 3 territories [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The Government of Canada published the Federal Adaptation Policy Framework in 2011 which outlines the federal role in adaptation (generating and sharing information; building adaptive capacity; and mainstreaming adaptation policies) and provides criteria for federal departments and agencies to consider when identifying climate change adaptation priorities [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This framework is valuable and an important development, but does not identify how the federal government will work with other levels of government and does not suggest a direction for Canada as a whole to take in adapting to climate change, outside of the federal government; in the general scholarship, these have been identified as important components of government planning for adaptation [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Some climate change effects will be felt in localized areas of Canada, meaning much adaptation will also need to be implemented by municipal governments [
