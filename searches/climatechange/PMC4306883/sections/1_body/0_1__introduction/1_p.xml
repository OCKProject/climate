<p class="p">Climate change has been identified as a major risk to human health [

Climate-related health risks are already evident in events such as the 2003 European heat wave and flooding in Alberta, Canada in 2013, and demonstrate that high income countries such as Canada will be affected by the health effects of climate change [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In light of the risks posed by climate change, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for greater global action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Yet, as the recent IPCC Fifth Assessment Report highlights, some degree of climate change and associated health impacts are inevitable, increasing the importance of adaptation [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and in a health context is synonymous with prevention (

While numerous opportunities for adaptation in a health context exist, managing the effects of climate change on human health has nevertheless been identified as a formidable challenge for both policy makers and health professionals [
