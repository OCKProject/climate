 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>].Since these three regional initiatives were implemented jointly by all three provinces, for analysis our results show Alberta and Saskatchewan province as having implemented one initiative each. PARC is a good example of how provinces or territories can cooperate to adapt to regional climate change impacts.
