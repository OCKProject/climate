<p class="p">Despite these trends and the need for support, the influence of higher-level governments on municipal adaptation planning and implementation is not clear based on the publically available information reviewed here. Local governments are not entirely autonomous actors in adaptation and can be assisted or constrained by higher-level governments [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-12-00623" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Based on our review, large Canadian municipalities seem to follow the latter pattern, where some cities such as Toronto and Vancouver have committed to adaptation, while others including Ottawa, Montreal, Edmonton and Calgary report doing little to nothing. Provincial adaptation also does not appear to exert a strong influence on municipal adaptation: Quebec is a leader in provincial adaptation, while Montreal, Quebecâ€™s largest city, reported few health focused adaptations; British Columbia is a laggard among Canadian provinces, but its largest city Vancouver is progressing autonomously.
