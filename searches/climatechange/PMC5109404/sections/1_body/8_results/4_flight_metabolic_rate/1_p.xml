<p class="p">Again, sexes differed in their FMR patterns. Northern females tended to have higher FMR, independent of habitat and developmental temperature (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>) turned out to be more complicated with habitat specific effects but in interaction with the thermal treatment. Under southern thermal conditions FMR was higher in southern males of agricultural ecotypes compared to woodland ecotypes and in northern males FMR tended to be actually higher in the woodland ecotype compared to the agricultural ecotype. However, this difference was only true for males of southern origin and disappeared at northern thermal conditions (
