<p class="p">As predicted, flight distance patterns differed between the sexes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). While the flight performance of males depended on latitude only, the flight performance of females was much more sensitive to the combined effects of latitude, habitat type and developmental temperature. Northern males flew shorter distances than southern males. In contrast, northern females flew longer distances after development under cool, northern developmental temperature, and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic> for southern females, but the latter was only significant in females of woodland origin as there was no significant difference relative to developmental temperature in southern females of agricultural landscape origin. In both sexes, the distance flown increased with flight duration.
