<p class="p">As predicted, the results for SMR were very different in adult males and females (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a,b</xref>). Northern males had higher SMR than southern males, independent of habitat and developmental temperature. In females, there was no latitudinal signal, but a significant interaction effect of habitat by developmental temperature. Independent of latitude, SMR increased strongly with developmental temperature in individuals of agricultural landscape origin only; females of woodland population origin did not show a significant response to developmental temperature. In females – but not in males – there was also a significant positive effect of age at testing and of the ambient temperature at testing.
