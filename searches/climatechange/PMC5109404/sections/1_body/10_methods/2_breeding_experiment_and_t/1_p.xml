<p class="p">The first thermal treatment corresponded to a cool larval developmental regime as in the north (average day temperature: 17.1 ± 0.1 °C; average night temperature: 12.3 ± 0.6 °C) and the other to a warmer developmental regime as in the south (average day temperature: 22.1 ± 0.1 °C; average night temperature: 17.1 ± 0.5 °C). The applied values for the day temperatures were close to the long-term average ambient temperatures as recorded in nearby meteorological stations in summertime
