<p class="p">Once the butterfly was attached and the chamber closed (&lt;5 min of manipulation), the mill was blocked with a magnet on the roof of the chamber. The chamber was kept under a light source (Philips HPL-R 400 W) and covered with a non-transparent cloth for 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 20 min (i.e. time needed to flush out CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). Then we removed the cloth and closed the metabolic chamber to let CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> accumulate during the performance test. Butterflies were allowed to fly during 10 min and stimulated to keep on flying by gently tapping on the chamber. The metabolic chamber was flushed again (flow rate: 1982 ± 31 ml/min) and the accumulated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was measured for 9 min (i.e. until 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. null CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> level). Metabolic rates were calculated in ml CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/h
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. SMR was based on 12 min of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission at rest (10 min of accumulation and 2 min measurement) and FMR on 10 min of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission during flight.
