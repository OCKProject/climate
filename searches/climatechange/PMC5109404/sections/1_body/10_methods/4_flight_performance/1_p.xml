The bent tip of a needle was carefully glued on the pterothoracic segment (glue: Cyanocrylate ZAP PT09) and the upward pointing end of the needle fitted into a freely hinging holder at one side of the arm of the flight mill. Next, the 7-L chamber containing the flight mill, was closed (i.e., metabolic chamber connected to respirometer system). Ambient temperature ( ± SD) in the chamber was kept at 30.8 ± 0.6 °C (range: 29.1–33.6; within the voluntary flight activity range of body temperatures
