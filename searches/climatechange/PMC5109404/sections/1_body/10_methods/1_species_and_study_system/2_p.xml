<p class="p">The offspring (i.e., F1 generation) was reared on potted 
 <italic class="italic">P. trivialis</italic> under the same light and thermal conditions (33 families in total; north-woodland: 8; north-agri: 9; south-woodland: 6; south-agri: 10 – average larval density per plant ± 1 SD = 6.4 ± 2.6; max = 8; N

Next, we created a F2 generation from which individuals were used for the experiments of this article (37 families in total; north-woodland: 8; north-agri: 9; south-woodland: 11; south-agri: 9). We did not cross between the different latitudes or between the ecotypes and excluded sib mating. At the day of oviposition, F2 eggs were transferred to a Petri dish. Four freshly hatched sibling larvae were placed on a potted tuft of 
 <italic class="italic">P. trivialis</italic>. They were placed in one of two thermal treatments in two incubators (Sanyo MIR-554) following a split-brood design.
