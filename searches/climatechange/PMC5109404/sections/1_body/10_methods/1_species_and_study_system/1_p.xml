 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic> is a Palearctic butterfly; in NW-Europe it increased both in distribution and abundance over the last few decades
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. Females lay eggs singly on different grasses. Gravid females (n = 44) were captured in nine populations: four populations in north Belgium (north; 51.0°N) and five in France (South; 46.3°N) along one longitude (4–5°E). The distance between the closest northern and southern populations was 522 km and they are located in different agroclimatic zones with warmer temperatures and increased solar radiation in the south compared to the north. At each latitudinal zone (Belgium or France) we collected females in at least two woodland and two agricultural landscape populations (Belgium: 2 woodland populations: Peertbos Herentals and Merodebos Herenthout; 2 agricultural landscape populations: Geel Ten Aert and Morkhoven – France: 2 woodland populations: Forêt de Villard and Bois Février; 3 agricultural landscape populations: Corgens, La Prairie and Laiz). Females were kept in small individual cages (30 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) and transported to a climate room; they had access to a 10% honey solution and a tuft of potted host grass (

Conditions in the climate room (Photoperiod: L:D 16 h:08 h; day temperature: 24.0 ± 0.8 °C and night temperature: 15.5 ± 0.5 °C; Philips HPI-T 400 W lamps were switched on at 7h00 Central European Time) induced direct larval development
