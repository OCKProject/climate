<p class="p">Data were analyzed with Linear Mixed Models (following Box-Cox transformations if required; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05 for all Shapiro-Wilk tests on model residuals) in R software (v 3.0.1; nlme package). Analyses were done separately for males and females. Models tested the effects of latitude, habitat of origin (i.e., ecotype), developmental treatment and interaction effects. Age, temperature at testing and body mass were covariates. Full models of flight performance (i.e., distance flown) and FMR included total flight duration and testing time as covariates. The random factor population(family(paired larval rearing plant(larval rearing plant))) adjusted the analysis for the experimental design and pedigree (i.e., relatedness at the population and family level, common hatching date and rearing environment). Stepwise backward selection was applied selecting the minimal adequate model (keeping at least population(family) as random factor). We kept the model with the best fit based on the log-likelihood ratio test.
