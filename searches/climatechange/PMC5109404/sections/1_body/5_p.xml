<p class="p">In the laboratory, we simulated a reciprocal transplant experiment between two latitudes by rearing offspring of females of both ecotypes (woodland and agricultural populations) at the average temperature of the northern latitude (Belgium) and of the southern latitude (France) according to a full factorial design. There is latitudinal variation in morphology (e.g., larger adults with latitude), but the steepness of the gradients varies between the ecotypes (e.g., stronger increase in size in agricultural compared to woodland ecotype

We measured standard metabolic rate (SMR) and quantified flight performance (i.e., flight endurance, measured as distance flown under stimulation) and simultaneously flight metabolic rate (FMR) in a flight mill in order to test for sex-specific latitude and ecotype effects after larval development under northern or southern thermal conditions.
