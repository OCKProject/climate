 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, weather-related interruptions of flight activity are assumed to be of considerable biological significance. Latitude-related constraints in adult activity budget and in higher synchronization of adult emergence in the north
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> lead to the prediction of increased metabolic rates in northern compared to southern populations. This effect is predicted to be stronger in males because 
 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic> is a monandrous species with an increasing degree of protandry in the north
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Although male behaviour differs between woodland and agricultural populations, there is no evidence of differences in SMR between males adopting different mate-locating behaviours
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. Similar to males, northern females are predicted to have an increased metabolic rate than southern females. However, taking into account ecotype-related thermal differences in females
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>, metabolic rates could be more canalized in females of woodland origin (i.e., more buffered thermal environment) compared to females of agricultural landscape origin. We predict higher plasticity in metabolic rates in individuals of agricultural landscape origin – which may interfere with latitudinal variation – as thermal conditions in 
 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic> habitat in agricultural landscape is more variable compared to cooler and thermally buffered habitat in woodlands
