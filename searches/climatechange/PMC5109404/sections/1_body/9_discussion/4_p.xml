<p class="p">In line with the dispersal-related predictions, FMR showed a clear relationship with latitude in females only. Northern females had higher FMR than southern females, but without any signature of their ecotype of origin. In males there was a significant negative effect of age, but that was a covariate and not a factor of interest in our experiments; age-effects of insect flight performance at the physiological level are known since long
