<p class="p">As predicted, patterns of SMR differed between males and females. The main effect of latitude on SMR independent of the thermal developmental conditions in males suggests a contribution of the genotype as we worked with F2 individuals. Northern or Belgian genotypes had higher SMR in males than southern or French genotypes, as predicted. However, females responded very differently as there was no effect of latitude on SMR, but a strong interaction effect between thermal conditions during larval development and the habitat type of origin. Females that originated from the ancestral woodland ecotype showed a canalized response for SMR relative to thermal treatment both for northern and southern latitudes. Females that originated from the agricultural landscape ecotype showed a much more plastic response, with higher SMR after the warm, southern developmental treatment compared to the cool, northern developmental treatment. This result supports the idea of female-limited differences in the degree of phenotypic plasticity of SMR between the ecotypes. This difference was independent of latitude, at least at the spatial scale it was tested here. The mechanistic underpinning of latitudinal variation in metabolic rates is still poorly understood, but recent work on orchid bees indicates a significant role for flight muscle membrane composition in explaining variation in FMR
