<p class="p">In conclusion, our study provides experimental evidence for the sex-specific role of ecological context (i.e., habitat) to modulate intraspecific ecophysiology and flight performance in a context of range dynamics in an ectothermic insect under niche expansion. We demonstrated the relevance of studying functional phenotypes and performance at the core of the range in a context of climate-related range dynamics.</p>
