<p class="p">Phenotypic change of a local population can be as important as environmental variability to understand population dynamics at the local, regional or range scale
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. Behavioural and physiological traits of founders can have strong impact on population traits of new local populations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. Combining butterfly monitoring schemes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref> with phenotypic and genetic surveys at a wider geographic scale would be an interesting approach to better grasp the eco-evolutionary dynamics of range dynamics, beyond core-edge comparisons and providing much needed insights into the dynamics, admixture and replacements of southern and northern genotypes/phenotypes within populations across the organismâ€™s range.
