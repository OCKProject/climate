<p class="p">Particularly in vertebrate endotherms, several recent studies have interpreted latitudinal variation in resting metabolic rate within the context of the pace-of-life concept as an integrated mechanistic framework to understand variation in life styles relative to thermal conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. Tropical birds were shown to have lower pace of life characteristics compared to temperate-zone birds at the inter- and intraspecific level
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>. If we would assume a similar relationship between SMR and pace of life in butterflies, then latitudinal effects tend to go in the same direction, but at a much smaller spatial scale (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>. 500â€‰km) within the core of the distribution range. Such generalizations should be cautious at this stage; the universal validity of using metabolic rates as fundamental drivers of ecological and evolutionary processes has recently been questioned
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref> and the assumption of resting or standard metabolic rate as a proxy for energetic constraints may depend upon the general model of energy management that is applicable to the study organism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. Although much of this work was developed with endothermic vertebrates as study systems, the issue of energy management in ectotherms (including flying heliotherms like butterflies) and what that signifies for the assumption of the use of SMR as proxy for energetic constraints relative to other life history traits and fitness components needs further attention
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. Flight mills have been used before
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>, but we combined this performance measure with respirometry as the mill was constructed in a climatic chamber
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. Several studies on the evolutionary ecology of insect flight implicitly assumed flight performance to be unidimensional, but different flight types correspond to different performances (e.g., speed, maneuverability, endurance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>). The performance in the flight mill corresponds to flight endurance, which is relevant for dispersal or other longer bouts of flight like in male patrolling behaviour to locate females. Hence, this device does not provide a universal proxy for flight performance. Earlier work has addressed maneuverability and acceleration capacity, which are more relevant to male territorial perching behaviour, rather than flight endurance per se
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. FMR showed significant heritability that was context dependent in another butterfly species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref> and was influenced by genotype-by-environment interactions with temperature as relevant environmental factor
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. As butterflies were tethered, one has to be cautious with the absolute values of our estimates of flown distances, but our principal interest is a comparison between ecotypes and sexes.
