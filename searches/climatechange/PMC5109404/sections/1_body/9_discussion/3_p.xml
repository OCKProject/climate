<p class="p">Flight performance as quantified in a flight mill showed a sexual signature. The thermal treatment had no effect on the distance flown in males but southern males were more mobile than northern ones, whereas in females we found significant interaction effects between the thermal treatment and both latitude and habitat type, respectively. Flight distance was reduced if females developed under ‘transferred’ thermal conditions relative to their latitude of origin. So, southern genotypes that were forced to develop under cooler, northern conditions flew shorter distances in the flight mill than after development under warmer, southern conditions, and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>. The only exceptions were females of southern agricultural landscape origin; they did not reduce significantly their locomotor performance after cooler, northern developmental conditions as did the southern woodland ecotype. The general pattern is largely in line with local adaptation, i.e. constraints on flight performance after a thermal, larval development that deviated from the environment of origin. This was most pronounced in females of southern woodland landscape. This result is interesting for studying the effects of climate change related-movements that may occur also within the core of the range, with southern types moving poleward; like French butterflies joining, and eventually, taking over Belgian populations. One could also note that the southern agricultural females performed relatively poorly under their natural conditions compared to the other groups. Anyway, our results lead to the hypothesis that the probability, success rate and speed to colonize or invade northern areas or populations – also within the core of the range – is likely to differ between the ecotypes
