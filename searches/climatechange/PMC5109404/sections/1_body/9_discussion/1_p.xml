<p class="p">Here we focused on mechanistic, ecophysiological insights into how conspecifics of different habitats (i.e. ecotypes) and latitude cope differently with energetics and flight performance after larval development under different thermal conditions. Our reciprocal transplant experiment under laboratory conditions with 
 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic> butterflies originating from two different habitat types at two different latitudes showed sex-specific effects of the influence of latitude and habitat type on metabolic rate and flight performance. Ecological context modulates physiology of organisms and affects their context-dependent performance through behaviour
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. We will discuss i) the sexual dimorphism in metabolic rate relative to latitude and habitat and the significance of context-dependent plasticity; ii) flight performance in the flight mill relative to dispersal (and other movements); iii) the potential link with the pace-of-life concept; and iv) broader biogeographic and life history context of range dynamics within core areas of distribution ranges under climate change.
