<p class="p">At different latitudes, organisms are faced with different climatic conditions favoring specific life-history traits (or trait values). Such climate-related patterns are of particular significance for ectotherms
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Along latitudinal clines, populations of ectotherms are faced with different activity time budgets and different trade-offs between current and future reproduction. As predicted by the metabolic cold adaptation hypothesis, metabolic rates of ectotherms (including many insects) from cold environments tend to be higher compared to those from warm environments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Usually, these patterns are related to selection on growth rates and development time. However, recent work on 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila</italic> showed an alternative explanation for the same pattern; selection for survival in highly thermally variable habitats could also drive the evolution of respiratory metabolic rate in a pattern that is consistent with metabolic cold adaptation, but independent of selection on growth rate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Independent of juvenile or larval growth, such variable thermal conditions may be highly relevant for adult activity and locomotor performance in individuals of ectothermic species at different latitudes, or generally in different thermal environments.
