<p class="p">Many species respond to current climate change by range shifts. Such effects are most easily observed at the expanding range edge
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Newly colonized populations at the range edge may differ in phenotypic traits from long-established populations at the core of the range
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Dispersive individuals that are more likely to colonize new sites can be a non-random sample of the population
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. There can be further selection on functional traits in new populations at the moving edge creating stronger differentiation between edge and core populations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Studies comparing phenotypic traits between edge and core populations have been helpful to better understand range limits and expansion under climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, but changing climatic conditions may also change ecological and evolutionary responses across an organismâ€™s range. Therefore, distributions of phenotypic variation may also change at the core of the range and not exclusively at the expanding edge under climate change.
