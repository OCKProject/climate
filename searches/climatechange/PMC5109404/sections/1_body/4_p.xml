<p class="p">Independent of latitudinal variation, different habitat types can also be associated with significant intraspecific variation in energetics and locomotor performance. Therefore, species with ecotypes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> differing in thermal physiology and mobility that occur at the same latitude are of particular interest in the context of climate change. Here we addressed the issue of habitat-related energy metabolism and flight performance at two different latitudes within the core range of the Speckled wood (
 <italic class="italic">Pararge aegeria</italic> L.). The range of this butterfly has expanded northward
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, but in NW-Europe it recently also filled its range by niche expansion from woodland to agricultural landscape
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. Common garden experiments and reciprocal transplant experiments have pointed to several adaptive differences between populations of woodland and agricultural landscape origin
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. Woodlands are more humid, cooler and thermally buffered environments, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">P. aegeria</italic> habitat in agricultural landscape is drier, warmer, but also more variable, and much more fragmented
