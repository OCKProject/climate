<p class="p">Here we are interested in biogeographic, intraspecific variation in energetic constraints and management in adult insect ectotherms
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, and more particularly in flying heliotherms like butterflies. Their body temperature is strongly influenced by solar radiation, ambient temperature and wind speed through behavioural thermoregulation; body temperature will equal ambient temperature only in the absence of direct solar radiation. In temperate regions, values for the voluntary flight activity range lie well above the average ambient temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Most adult activities require active flight, but insect flight is metabolically costly
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. Average ambient temperature and solar radiation decrease with increasing latitude reducing the thermal window for butterfly activity. Moreover, weather conditions become more variable with increasing latitude, affecting potentially plastic responses and their evolution for energetic needs and physiological performance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Weather and its variability influence the occurrence of flight and inactivity and the duration of flight bouts in butterflies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. Reestablishing metabolic activity to resume adult activity and coordinated movement is energetically intensive requiring significant quantities of ATP to restore homeostasis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Hence, reduced activity budgets under more variable weather conditions at higher latitude can be compensated by an increased metabolic rate under conditions that allow adult activity.
