<p class="p">Several mechanisms contribute to geographic changes in phenotypic variation under climate change including phenotypic plasticity, mutations and evolution, evolution of increased phenotypic plasticity or invasion of southern phenotypes/genotypes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. The altered phenotypic composition may, in turn, influence responses at the population level and range dynamics at the species level. There is growing interest for studying phenotypic and genetic clines within the context of ecological and evolutionary responses to climate change
