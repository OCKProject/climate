<p class="p">The work on climate change impacts and adaptation conducted by Fussel and Klein (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) produced useful reference points for analysing adaptive capacity of households in the study area. The notion is that the greater the adaptive capacity of the farmer, the less climate change impact will be experienced versus farmers with very little or lack of adaptive capacity (
