<p class="p">The PACC will serve as a gear in accomplishing SDGs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-01134-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). If all stakeholders of global sustainable development keep the same momentum for the achievement of SDGs, then we will certainly accomplish them in time; as a result, the PACC will help to improve the lives of people and to build a better and safer future with no one left behind. However, the fact is that we have limited time to achieve all global SDGs by 2030. Hence, the well-organized and effective implementation of the PACC by the UN member states and partners will ultimately determine the degree of success and its impact on the international community and global sustainability. In other words, the PACC has become an “international law” as a result of a very bold and ambitious step taken by the UN to facilitate global sustainable development and to make this planet a healthier and happier place to live.
