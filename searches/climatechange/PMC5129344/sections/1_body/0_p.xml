<p class="p">It is indeed a great moment for the global community as the United Nations (UN) historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change (PACC) came into force on 4 November 2016 with jubilant celebrations. The international community had realized and was completely convinced that climate change is affecting global health, poverty, food security, and national and global security. This agreement is a clear indication that our global policy makers and stakeholders of global sustainable development are exceptionally determined to mitigate the inevitable climate disaster and accelerate sustainable development for the benefit of the people and the planet.</p>
