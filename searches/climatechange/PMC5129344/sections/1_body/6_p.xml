<p class="p">Taken together, the PACC sets a course for all countries to limit global temperature increase by taking bold steps towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to strengthen resilience with respect to the inevitable impacts of climate change. The enactment of the PACC marks the beginning of a new chapter for the global community and demonstrates that all countries around the world are serious about addressing climate change. There is no doubt that the landmark PACC will help not only in reducing greenhouse gas emissions at the global level but also in boosting global sustainable development. However, bearing in mind the massive task of accomplishing SDGs, there is a considerable amount of work that needs to be done.</p>
