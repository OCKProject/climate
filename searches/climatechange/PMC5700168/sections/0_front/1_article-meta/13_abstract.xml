 <p id="Par1" class="p">Methane (CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub>) strongly contributes to observed global warming. As natural CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions mainly originate from wet ecosystems, it is important to unravel how climate change may affect these emissions. This is especially true for ebullition (bubble flux from sediments), a pathway that has long been underestimated but generally dominates emissions. Here we show a remarkably strong relationship between CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition and temperature across a wide range of freshwater ecosystems on different continents using multi-seasonal CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition data from the literature. As these temperature–ebullition relationships may have been affected by seasonal variation in organic matter availability, we also conducted a controlled year-round mesocosm experiment. Here 4 °C warming led to 51% higher total annual CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition, while diffusion was not affected. Our combined findings suggest that global warming will strongly enhance freshwater CH
  <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions through a disproportional increase in ebullition (6–20% per 1 °C increase), contributing to global warming.
