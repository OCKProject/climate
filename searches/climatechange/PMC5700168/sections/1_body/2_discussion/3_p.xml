<p id="Par13" class="p">Overall, our experimental results combined with the analysis of field data provide evidence that temperature drives CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition in different types of freshwater ecosystems in different parts of the world. This strongly suggests that climate change will substantially increase freshwater CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions through a disproportional increase in ebullition, forming a positive feedback between climate change and freshwater GHG emissions. Our study is the first to show that a strong relationship between temperature and ebullition exists on a large geographical scale and provides estimates of the increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition with climate warming. However, the limited availability of data sets (both globally and per system type) hampers accurate predictions about the relative and absolute increase of this important GHG emission pathway. Hence, to be able to extrapolate our findings to global freshwater CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, as well as to better predict changes in future emissions, we stress the need for more measurements including ebullition with high spatiotemporal coverage.
