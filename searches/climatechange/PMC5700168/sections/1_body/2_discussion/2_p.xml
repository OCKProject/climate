 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). It is currently unknown whether relative increases in ebullition will differ among certain climate regions. Microbial communities in the Arctic, for example, are well adapted to low temperatures

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in permanently cold sediments has been shown to adapt when exposed to higher than in situ temperatures through changes in community composition and metabolic rates

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production does not seem to differ between cold and warm climate regions

 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> reason to assume that it would be different for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition. The exponential nature of the empirical relationships in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> points out that the absolute effects of warming on ebullition are largest in warmer areas and during the warmest months. Exponential increases in methanogenesis rates have been found up to temperatures of 40 °C
