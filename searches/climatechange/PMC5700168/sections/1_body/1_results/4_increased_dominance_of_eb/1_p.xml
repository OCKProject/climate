<p id="Par10" class="p">The existence of a threshold temperature marking the onset—or a strong increase—of ebullition is a major concern for sudden shifts in global GHG emissions with climate warming. We found that above a sediment temperature of ~10 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) ebullition strongly increases with temperature, which coincides with findings in another study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. However, despite this similarity, the threshold temperature varies among systems (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), likely depending on the physical structure of the sediment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>, forcing mechanisms
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>, and the methanogenesis rate at a certain temperature. The latter is ultimately determined by the microbial community
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup> and environmental factors including quality and quantity of available organic substrate
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>. With increasing substrate availability, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition shows a stronger temperature dependence than diffusive CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission in northern ponds and lakes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. Also, for our experiment, we see that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition becomes the dominant flux above sediment temperatures of ~10 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Our findings thus suggest that climate warming may change diffusion-dominated systems in colder areas into higher-emission, ebullition-dominated ones. This is particularly relevant for boreal and Arctic waters where &gt;50% of the studied systems (with available data on both CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition and diffusion) show that diffusion is the most important emission pathway
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. These cold systems already have an important share in global freshwater GHG emissions as their surface area accounts for almost half of the area of the world’s lakes and ponds
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. Many of these systems are small and shallow
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup> and will therefore rapidly warm as a consequence of the predicted increase in air temperature, which is expected to be stronger than the global average in the boreal and Arctic region
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>. In addition, many of the high northern latitude lakes are formed in permafrost soils. An increase in temperature should therefore not only enhance microbial metabolism of existing substrates, but also lead to more permafrost thaw, which increases substrate availability and methanogenesis per square meter of lake on decadal to century time scales
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>, though the process may be limited by widespread thaw lake drainage
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. The resulting increase in ebullition in these high-latitude systems may greatly amplify their share in freshwater GHG emissions.
