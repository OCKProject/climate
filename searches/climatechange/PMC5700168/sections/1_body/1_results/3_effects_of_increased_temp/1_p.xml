<p id="Par9" class="p">Besides emission by ebullition, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> may also diffuse from the water column into the atmosphere. Diffusive CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions in our experiment only accounted for 10% (control) and 5% (warm) of total CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and correlated significantly with temperature during the year (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This positive correlation corroborates findings for diffusive CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from another mesocosm experiment

 </sup> as well as from an analysis of data from globally distributed wetland and freshwater ecosystems

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. In part, this may be due to gas dissolution during bubble rise

 </sup>. Interestingly, however, cumulative annual diffusive CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in our experiment show that year-round warming did not enhance the diffusive emission pathway (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This clearly shows that increased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production with warming (as indicated by increased ebullition) does not necessarily result in increased diffusive CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions over a longer period of time (e.g., a year), likely because of (over)compensation by increased CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> consumption rates in the sediment top layer and water column
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. This further substantiates the key role of the ebullitive pathway in total CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions.
