<p id="Par7" class="p">The temperature–ebullition relationships from field measurements are likely to be influenced by differences in sampling methods as well. The available temperature data, for instance, was measured in air, water, or sediment. Also the period of sampling varied (year-round versus spring–summer or summer–autumn), which may have influenced the temperature coefficient in multiple ways. For one, a decrease in CH

Second, seasonal variations in organic carbon supply and oxygen availability alter CH
