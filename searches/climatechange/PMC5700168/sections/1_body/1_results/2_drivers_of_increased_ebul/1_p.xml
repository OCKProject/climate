 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition showed a strong relationship with temperature in our mesocosm experiment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), which fits our analyses of data from field measurements (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We found that cumulative annual ebullition was 51% higher in the warm treatment (

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition in temperate regions is a realistic future scenario. Warming may affect CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition in different ways. System productivity, for example, may be affected by warming

 </sup>, altering the availability of substrate for methanogenesis. We found, however, no significant differences in gross primary production nor in sedimented carbon between our control and warm treatment (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), indicating that substrate supply was not responsible for the large increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition with warming. We estimate that the effect of temperature-dependent changes in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solubility during the spring–midsummer period (period with increasing temperature) contributed 14% (control) and 7% (warm) to the total CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition as a result of dissolved CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> that turned gaseous. For the midsummer–winter period (period with decreasing temperature), CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition was lowered by 17% (control) and 13% (warm) as a result of increased pore water solubility (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). However, effects of changes in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solubility were negligible for cumulative annual ebullitive fluxes. The negligible difference in organic carbon supply as well as the negligible effect of changes in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> solubility strongly suggests that temperature dependency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition in our experiment was mostly driven by enhanced microbial metabolism and growth.
