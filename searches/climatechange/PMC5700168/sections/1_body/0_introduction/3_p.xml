<p id="Par5" class="p">To quantify the increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition due to temperature-induced increase in sediment CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, we combined a standardized search for published data (as in ref. 
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>) with a mesocosm experiment. In the literature search, we only included studies with ebullition data from different types of freshwater ecosystems that covered a temperature range of at least 10 °C, and excluded short-term (&lt;24 h), infrequent (&lt;once per month) ebullition measurements since these likely underestimate the ebullitive flux

 </sup>. To exclude influences of confounding factors occurring in the field, and to further unravel the relative importance of the different processes responsible for the temperature-induced increase in ebullition, we conducted an experiment in 1000 L mesocosms containing natural lake sediments and plankton communities comparing a temperate (control; 
 <italic class="italic">n = </italic>4) and a warming (+4 °C; 
 <italic class="italic">n = </italic>4) scenario (IPCC scenario RCP8.5
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>). Since the frequency of heat waves is expected to increase over most land areas under future climate projections

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>, we included a midsummer 7-day heat wave (+4 °C). Day and night water-atmosphere diffusive gas fluxes were measured once every 2 weeks, using a closed chamber connected to a GHG analyzer, whereas bubbles were collected continuously by inverted funnel-type bubble traps. Our data compilation shows remarkably strong relationships between CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition and temperature across a wide range of freshwater ecosystems, which we also observed in our mesocosm experiment. Our analysis of the experimental data further suggests that direct effects of temperature on microbial growth and metabolism are driving the increase in ebullition. These combined findings indicate a positive feedback for global warming.
