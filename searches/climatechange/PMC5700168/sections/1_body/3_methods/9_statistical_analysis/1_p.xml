<p id="Par29" class="p">To test for monotonic relationships between water temperature and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> diffusion, we used Spearman’s rank correlations. Temperature values for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition were obtained by averaging water temperature over each bubble collection period, while for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> diffusion; the average daily temperature at day of flux measurement was used. Cumulative annual CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> ebullition, sedimentation, GPP, and diffusion data were tested for normal distribution using the Shapiro–Wilk’s test (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05) and a visual inspection of histograms, normal Q–Q plots and box plots. The Brown–Forsythe test was used to assess homogeneity of variances. Differences between treatments were tested with a Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test or—in case assumptions for normality and homogeneity of variance were violated—with a Mann–Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> test. All 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values mentioned are two-tailed. Statistical analyses were carried out using IBM SPSS 21 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA).
