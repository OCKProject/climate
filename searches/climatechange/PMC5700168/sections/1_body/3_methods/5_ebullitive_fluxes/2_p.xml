<p id="Par21" class="p">Ebullitive gas samples were analyzed for O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> once during the experiment, using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer (Agilent 5975C; Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> each typically formed less than 1% of total gas volume, while N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O could not be detected. N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was the second main component of the gas, together with CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> composing about 99% of ebullitive gas volume. On several occasions, gas volume in bubble traps was visually inspected before and after diffusive flux measurements to assess whether possible disturbance during this measurement would trigger bubble release. We observed no effect. Between 9 and 15 September, bubble traps were not in use due to maintenance.
