 </sup>. We further expanded our literature collection by adding the relevant references indicated in studies we found. From all the papers that were collected, we selected those that contained ebullition data from open waters such as ponds, lakes, reservoirs, and rivers within an air/water/sediment temperature range of at least 10 °C to quantitatively model the relationship between ebullition and temperature. Due to the temporal heterogeneity of ebullition, data from short measurements (&lt;24 h) can seriously under- or overestimate ebullitive fluxes and were therefore excluded
