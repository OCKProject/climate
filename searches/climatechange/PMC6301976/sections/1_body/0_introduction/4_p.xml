 </sup>, but rarely includes environmental stochasticity and ecological uncertainty. Nonlinear stochastic models, however, do allow for nuances involving uncertain return-periods of thermal events. Here we constructed a nonlinear hybrid-stochastic-dynamical system to model the responses of coral populations to the complexities of sea-surface temperature cycles, which vary stochastically in both frequency and intensity. We estimated recovery rates from disturbances to the coral reefs in southern Japan and Western Australia, which have similar coral-species composition. We then input these recovery rates into a generic model that predicted disturbance and recovery of Indo-Pacific coral populations into the year 2100, superimposed on increasing global sea-surface temperatures.
