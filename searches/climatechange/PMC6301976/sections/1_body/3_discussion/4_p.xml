<p id="Par20" class="p">Secondly, the data used to parameterize the model showed that coral populations in the two locations recovered at different rates. Coral recovery is dependent on numerous conditions, including recent history and what remains on the reef, and the period of recovery between thermal-stress events

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. Indeed, the capacity of a population to regrow from remnant fragments has a considerable impact on the recovery rates of coral populations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. For example, small isolated remnants of massive 
 <italic class="italic">Porites</italic> species regrow rapidly after disturbances
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>, but isolated remnants of corymbose 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora</italic> species rarely regrow
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, corymbose 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora</italic> populations are mostly dependent on larval recruitment for population recovery, whereas massive 
 <italic class="italic">Porites</italic> can regrow from local remnants. These differences were reflected in the high variance in the 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora</italic> response, compared with the lower variance of 
 <italic class="italic">Porites</italic> response (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Recovery on a particular reef also depends upon the location of the nearest larval source. Scott Reef is considerably more isolated than Sesoko Island, which is adjacent to Okinawa where remnant coral populations survived through the 1998-thermal stress event. Isolation may have played a role in the differences in recovery rates between Scott Reef and Sesoko Island.
