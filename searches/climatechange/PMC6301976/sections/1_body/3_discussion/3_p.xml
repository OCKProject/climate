 </sup>. Our results showed that after intense and frequent thermal-stress events, the coral populations often hovered around &lt;10% coral cover, from which the populations were unlikely to recover. Extremely low coral cover may reduce larval supply, which would further reduce recruitment through the Allee effect, with fitness declining in step with declines in population size.
