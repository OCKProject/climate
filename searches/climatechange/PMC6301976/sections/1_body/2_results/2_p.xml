<p id="Par16" class="p">Considering a negative effect of high sea-surface temperature on coral populations, the λ-values (Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ3" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>), or the ‘climate-change coefficients’, were estimated at 0.015, 0.021, and 0.039 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), for RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5, respectively. Increases to the thermal susceptibility, 
 <italic class="italic">γ</italic>, in Equation 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1a</xref>, resulted in reductions in overall coral cover (compare Fig 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> to 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Similarly, increasing the ‘extreme-event coefficient’, resulted in bimodal responses, with some model runs predicting population collapse, whereas other runs predicted recovery (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). When the frequency of thermal-stress events was increased from 3–9 years to 3–6 years, the corals did not recover, particularly when thermal anomalies also increased in intensity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>), as is expected under a business-as-usual climate-change scenario (RCP 8.5). It is notable that when the two localities, with different coral recovery rates, were modeled, they showed different responses; Western Australia, with lower coral recovery rates (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.17), completely collapsed under high frequency and intensity temperature anomalies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>), whereas reefs in southern Japan, with considerably higher coral recovery rates (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.39), maintained low coral cover (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>).
