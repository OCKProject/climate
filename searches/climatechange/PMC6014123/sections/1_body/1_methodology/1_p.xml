<p class="p">The population for the study comprises university students at a rural South African university. The participants were from three faculties of the university, namely, Faculty of Health Sciences, Faculty of Science and Agriculture and Faculty of Humanities. This study utilised a quantitative approach and a descriptive design. Therefore, the findings of the study are based only on how respondents self-report. Convenience sampling was used to obtain respondents. This method was used because participants were easily available. Cooper and Schindler (
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) assert that convenience sampling is a non-probability sampling technique where participants are selected based on ease of access and proximity. Self-administered questionnaires were utilised in a survey to collect data from participants following a similar study by Ojomo et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). A pilot survey was conducted to pre-test the data collection tool. Calitz (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) states that a pilot study is an experimental version of the actual research. A pilot study makes it possible to identify and eliminate problems which might be faced later in the study as well as to improve the face and content validity of the questionnaire (Cooper &amp; Schindler 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Hazz and Maldaon (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) are of the view that a sample size of 10% – 20% is appropriate to conduct a pilot study. As such, 15 questionnaires were sent out to university students. This led to the fine-tuning of the questionnaire where some questions were rephrased to suit the English proficiency of participants. Closed-ended questions were used and the questionnaire consisted of two sections: biographical questions and questions relating to climate change dynamics. It was used following similar studies on climate change where the tool showed high levels of reliability and validity. A five-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree was used. A sample of 90 university students participated in the survey. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and
