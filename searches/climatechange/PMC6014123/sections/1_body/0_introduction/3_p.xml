<p class="p">Hargreaves, Lewis and Speers (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) posit that people with a formal science qualification have a higher understanding of the process through which climate change works. This implies that not all students in universities have knowledge about how climate change works, that is, the causes, impacts as well as mitigation measures. It has also been discovered that awareness of the causes and impacts of climate change is low amongst people under the age of 25 and those over the age of 65 (Bibbings 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; DEFRA 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Despite the mixed perceptions on climate change knowledge and level of awareness reflected in the literature, it is imperative for university students to have knowledge of climate change. This is because it gives them the capacity to devise ways of mitigating its impacts. Wolf and Moser (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) are of the view that perceptions on climate change issues are thought to contribute to ways of finding possible solutions to the problem. Weber (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) asserts that through studies such as geography and environmental science, students acquire a more detailed appreciation of climate change than a layman in the community. Apart from fields related to natural sciences and environment, university students are exposed to the scientific and analytical processes that they are anticipated to use in determining the risk and danger of climate change.
