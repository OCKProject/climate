<p class="p">This study adopted the social constructionism theory. Giddens (
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:160) asserts that, ‘social constructionism is an approach to studying social problems, including environmental problems. Social constructionism suggests that the social is not a given, and so is any knowledge of it’. The assumption is that knowledge of the world is not an objective approach to taken-for-granted knowledge (McHoul &amp; Grace 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>). It has explored how some environmental issues are seen as significant whereas others are seen to be less important or are largely ignored. Social constructionists suggest that all environmental problems are, to some extent, socially constructed by groups of people. Climate change is amongst the most complex challenges that the world is facing. Its impacts considerably contribute to the development challenges of ensuring food security and poverty reduction in the developing world. The phenomenon is broadly viewed as substantial because of its impacts on society, economy and health of the communities. This denotes that university students’ knowledge of climate change is of paramount importance because they significantly contribute to the development of any community in many respects (Amanchukwu, Amadi-Ali &amp; Ololube 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). The social constructionism provides an important framework for understanding climate change as a serious challenge which students have to understand and for which they are able to devise mitigation measures in future.
