<p class="p">The quality of life of university students can be influenced by the type of information they receive on climate change. To explain, the information, in whatever form it comes, shapes their sense of efficacy and agency to inspire changes within their communities. University students are ardent technology users with potential to make important contributions to climate change mitigation (El Zoghbi &amp; El Ansari 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Although the impacts of climate change are more severe in the developing world, it is imperative for university students in developing countries to have great awareness and knowledge of the impacts of climate change such that they will be able to devise ways to mitigate climate change. Students are the future leaders. Hence, having a generation which understands the effects of climate change enables them to influence policy. Students play an important role in educating the citizenry on climate change in their various localities. However, awareness and knowledge of climate change vary in many respects. Oâ€™Connor et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>) assert that awareness and knowledge of climate change are higher amongst men, graduates and middle-aged people. In both the UK and US studies, men were found to be more aware of the impacts and causes of climate change, whereas a majority of women somehow showed less knowledge about the causes of climate change (Bibbings 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Also, DEFRA (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) asserts that graduates are more likely to have heard of climate change as compared to non-graduates. This implies that university students or those who have a higher level of education are more likely to have an impact on climate change (Eurobarometer 
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). This was supported by Ayanlade (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) who found that a large number of graduates from Nigerian universities have knowledge about climate change and they developed awareness of climate change through different channels.
