<p class="p">Climate change and its impacts have grave consequences on communities and people’s livelihoods. Weber (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) defines climate change as systematic changes in average weather conditions over time. The changes are difficult to observe and could not be statistically measured; hence, it is difficult for sceptics to believe climate change is happening. The knowledge and awareness of climate change by university students is of paramount importance as it equips them with skills to deal with its future impacts. El Zoghbi and El Ansari (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) assert that young people will experience the impact of climate challenges in their future families and communities. Hence, it will be imperative for them to deal with climate impacts such as extreme weather events and rising temperatures as they are expected to be extreme and frequent. The implications of climate change are likely to outspread beyond physical impacts to other aspects such as youth’s emotional health, social inclusion, academic and professional functioning of life. This addresses the limitations of a definition of climate change by Weber and Stern (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) who defined climate change as a set of physical phenomena and public policy issue which is also referred to as global warming. As a result, it is apparent that the effects of climate change should not be limited to physical phenomena and policy issues; rather, it should be related to a plethora of aspects. For instance, Mugambiwa and Tirivangasi (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) are of the view that climate change is likely to reduce the role of agriculture to the gross domestic product (GDP) and pose a serious threat to national food security and the economy. Consequently, it is apparent that the effects of climate change can be classified into many distinct categories and as a result the phenomenon should be broadly defined.
