<p class="p">Recently in Southern Africa, the effects of climate change which turned into a disaster risk were felt through tropical cyclone Dineo, which affected some parts of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. Consequently, a number of people lost their lives and property. This implies that climate change poses various threats to the environment, economy as well as peopleâ€™s health. These climate-related risks are ignited by floods, droughts and extremely hot weather conditions.
