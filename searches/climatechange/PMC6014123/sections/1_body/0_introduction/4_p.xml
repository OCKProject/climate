<p class="p">Furthermore, in a contrary viewpoint, Brody et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Weber (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) are of the view that the more educated people (most likely university graduates) are less likely to believe that climate change is risky compared with uneducated people. However, these differences in opinion about climate change issues result in difficulty maintaining commitment to the cause. This is because even though most people report being aware of climate change and its causes, they cannot fully explain its causes, consequences and solutions. Lorenzoni, Nicholson-Cole and Whitmarsh (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) are of the view that most people believe that climate change is caused by anthropogenic and natural causes although they do not understand the details.
