<p class="p">Climate change and its impacts have grave consequences on communities and people’s livelihoods. This research suggests that it is worrying to note that students in this particular South African university have little understanding of climate change issues. It emerged that students are not actively involved in climate change initiatives. It was also discovered that universities, as demonstrated by students’ responses in this study, are doing little to incorporate students into climate change awareness programmes. However, a majority of the students of this study have proven to be aware of the threats that climate change poses to communities. This is imperative as the knowledge and awareness of climate change by university students equip them with skills to deal with its future impacts. This was conducted in line with the social constructionism theory which explores how some environmental issues are seen as significant while others are seen to be less important or are largely ignored. In this case, as climate change is amongst the most complex challenges that the world is facing, its impacts considerably contribute to the development challenges of ensuring food security and poverty reduction in the developing world. Hence, if students were knowledgeable and become involved through being taught about climate change, they could potentially make a great impact.</p>
