<p class="p">Moreover, the study discovered that university students are not actively participating in programmes aimed at dealing with climate change. The Cronbach’s alpha of 0.83 indicates high levels of reliability of the measures. In relation to this finding, studies by Semenza et al. (

 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) found that there is an attitude–behaviour gap in environmental problems. They further asserted that even those who claim to be concerned usually provide a plethora of reasons why they usually do not change their behaviours. Studies also suggest that those who report making changes may not have high behavioural engagement. Changes such as reducing energy use are commonly made for other reasons apart from climate change adaptation or mitigation reasons. Therefore, this could explain the reasons why university students are not involved in climate change programmes.
