<p class="p">Furthermore, on the sources of information about climate change, a significant number of participants (mean = 3.52; s.d. = 1.18) indicated that they learnt more about climate change through the media than in the class (mean = 3.42; s.d. = 1.31), although some participants agreed that they learnt about climate change in the class (mean = 3.42; s.d. = 1.31). However, students should not largely rely on the information they acquire from the media and some seemingly credible textbooks as it is prone to bias. Similarly, a study by Shepardson et al. (

This explains some of the common misconceptions about climate change issues by students. In essence, it can be established that young people’s scientific understanding of the causes of anthropogenic climate change relies mostly on their formal education.
