<p class="p">In our study we have adopted the assumption [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] that vulnerability is equal to: 50% potential impact (sensitivity and exposure) and 50% adaptive capacity. It is possible that greater weight could be attributed to adaptive capacity, if for instance, human capital rather than the presence of natural hazards (exposure) or loss of climatic suitability for cropping systems (sensitivity) drives vulnerability. Future studies could focus on the impacts on vulnerability of increasing the weight of AC for instance. Furthermore we aggregated the indicators within the three components of vulnerability using a deductive approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>] with multiple indicators that are thought to influence vulnerability selected and weighted equally. It is possible however to prioritise indicators [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>] based on perceived importance which can be achieved in a number of ways, including stakeholder meetings or expert consultations [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>].
