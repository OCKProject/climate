<p class="p">Datasets produced at a global extent may not effectively capture the sub national context. A recent investigation by Trigg et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref107" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>] tested 6 global models used to derive flood hazard and found that agreement between the models for the African continent was roughly 30–40%, thus highlighting the discrepancies between models when extracted to a reduced coverage. The global dataset for flood frequency [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] used in our study possesses a fine resolution (1km) and was validated by experts through a workshop in the case study countries, Vietnam and Nicaragua. However, there is a chance that at very fine resolutions (&lt;1km) and in areas where flash floods, complex topography, peri-urban landscapes and varying technological and management capacity exist; discrepancies between the model and reality are likely [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] is based on records from 1999–2007. However, this was the most up to date and robust data available at the time of the study. Despite inevitable constraints, the flooding and additional hazard datasets (
