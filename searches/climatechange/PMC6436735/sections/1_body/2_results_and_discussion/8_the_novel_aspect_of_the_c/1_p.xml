<p class="p">The CRVA builds upon previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] which integrate socio-economic, geographical and biophysical data into the vulnerability concept. Nevertheless, the integration of multiple natural hazards such as soil erosion, sea level rise and meteorological stresses such as flooding, tropical cyclones and drought into climate change vulnerability assessments focusing on agriculture remains novel [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The CRVA attempts to address this gap in vulnerability assessments through integrating a broader list of natural hazard stresses within the framework. In our study we develop upon the recent work of Bouroncle et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], which provided a detailed assessment of vulnerability of the agriculture sector in Central America to climate change, integrating multiple crops and the assessment of adaptive capacity through the livelihoods approach. Hence, the CRVA builds upon this recent study, using a similar methodology but with the inclusion of the natural hazards component within the vulnerability framework. A study by Yusuf and Fransisco [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] undertook a vulnerability assessment for South East Asia which included hazard indicators, but at a coarse resolution and without a focus on agriculture. Nonetheless, studies such as Cutter et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">101</xref>] have stressed the need to integrate the social vulnerability with natural hazard risk. Therefore the CRVA answers these calls and offers a more integrative approach through combining natural hazards within agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
