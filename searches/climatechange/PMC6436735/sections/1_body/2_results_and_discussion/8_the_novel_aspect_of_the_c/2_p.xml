<p class="p">The CRVA can be implemented in locations lacking comprehensive national data, as was recently displayed in the Union of the Comoros, with global and regional datasets integrated to provide an insight into the vulnerability of key agricultural commodity value chains to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. The CRVA framework integrates global, regional and when available national datasets from a range of sources (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>: see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" class="xref">methods</xref>). The utilised datasets are open source, published, and at a resolution that enables sub national level analysis. Furthermore, the vulnerability methodology enables the inclusion of the most important crops for food security. This goes beyond previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] which focused on single crop systems. The CRVA proposed therefore provides a more complete understanding of overall agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
