<p class="p">In respect to adaptive capacity, the indicators listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> have been recommended in previous vulnerability methodologies [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. It is important to note that in the case of Vietnam and Uganda we used indicators from 
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for adaptive capacity, whilst in the case of Nicaragua (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>), the adaptive capacity index was based on the livelihoods approach from Bouroncle et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In order to capture the respective adaptive capacity in Vietnam we focus on the education, poverty, health care, organizational capacity and accessibility/ infrastructure of the particular administrative unit, whilst in Uganda we use the same indicators with the exception of organizational capacity. It is important to note that we have not undertaken household surveys or primary data collection and instead rely on readily available and pre existing datasets that are aggregated to the administrative unit and cover the full extent of the respective countries (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Due to data limitations a degree of flexibility is required in order to represent these indicators. For example, in regard to education we use the ‘Primary net intake rate’ in Uganda whilst in Vietnam we use the ‘Percentage of graduates compared with total upper secondary candidates’, both datasets were obtained from the respective government statistics office, cover the full extent of the country and are at a high resolution (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In respect to health care, in Vietnam we created an average of the underweight, stunting and wasting datasets [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] which were available at the province level for the entirety of the country. These input datasets were developed as part of a 2010 National Nutrition Survey [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. In respect to Uganda, data on the health of the population was derived from a government dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] that captures both access to health care, sanitation and immunization at the district level across the full extent of Uganda (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). In regards to organizational capacity we were not able to obtain reliable data for Uganda. In Vietnam, we used government data at the province level for the number of agricultural unions over the number of farms for the year 2005 (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Both in Vietnam and Uganda, poverty was represented by the Gini income inequality index, whereby the administrative units with greater levels of inequality were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity. Finally, the accessibility/ infrastructure indicator was derived from a global dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] that estimates the travel time in hours from urban areas (&gt;50,000 inhabitants) based on a number of friction layers (road networks, railway networks, navigable rivers, major water bodies, shipping lanes, national borders, land cover, urban areas, elevation, and slope) at a resolution of 30 arc seconds (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We calculated an average travel time in hours for the respective districts in Vietnam and Uganda using our administrative shapefile and the raster dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. The districts with greater travel times were deemed to have lower adaptive capacity.
