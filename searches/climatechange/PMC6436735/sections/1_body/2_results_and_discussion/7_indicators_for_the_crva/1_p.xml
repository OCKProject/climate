<p class="p">The following section will discuss the indicators used to capture vulnerability as part of this study. It is important to understand that vulnerability is not a measurable phenomenon, it is instead a dynamic state which is the result of multiple interacting variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. As vulnerability cannot be measured directly [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>], a number of indicators which are presumed to affect vulnerability are aggregated to provide an indication, or an index of vulnerability. This is a relative scale which shows the spatial distribution of vulnerability within the respective unit of analysis, which in our case is the respective countries. The vulnerability cannot be compared between the countries as they use different indicators, instead, one can deduce a sense of which areas at the sub national scale are more or less vulnerable within the country of analysis.
