<p class="p">The CRVA provides a list of indicators for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> in methods) that can be used to determine the vulnerability of a location, at the national, regional, or local scale. As noted by Hinkel [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref096" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], there is a huge amount of inherent complexity when assessing vulnerability, with the economic, environmental and socio-economic fabric of the particular country determining which indicators are relevant. Schroter et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>] has highlighted the need to select indicators which would be understood by the stakeholders, as an emphasis should be placed on science that is robust but also understandable for the policy maker or the end target audience. Hinkel [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>] note that vulnerability assessments are often devised to inform policy rather than advance knowledge in an intrinsic sense and Erikson and Kelly [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>] noted that data limitations regarding quality and also availability direct the selection of indicators. In spite of the clear data limitations in some regions, Fussel and Klein [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref099" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] note that there is a move within vulnerability assessments to include more variables in an attempt to capture the complex realities which determine vulnerability. Schroter et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] however, note that care must be taken when choosing which indicators are important, for instance, the same indicator may not be relevant for countries with varying levels of development. Setting the indicators therefore requires an understanding of the country wide drivers of vulnerability, which can be achieved through consultation of the wider literature, discussion with national experts and meetings with stakeholders [
