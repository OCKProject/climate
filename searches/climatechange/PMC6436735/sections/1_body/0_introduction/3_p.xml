 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] threaten national economies and also the regional and global supply chains of these respective industries. The projected impacts of climate change are a threat to crop production in regions that currently experience food insecurity [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In Africa and south Asia, major grains including wheat, maize and sorghum are projected to suffer mean yield losses of 8% by 2050 with some crops, notably wheat in Africa, expected to experience a yield change of -17% [
