<p class="p">A first step in order to attract bilateral and multilateral support is for countries to prioritize the sub national areas that are most vulnerable to climate change and require technical assistance [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Given the extent to which climate change is already affecting many vulnerable communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and the finite resources available to development and governmental agencies [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], it is of paramount importance that interventions are strategically designed and implemented [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Vulnerability assessments (VA) have been developed to provide guidance and support for adaptation planning and justification for project implementation in order to create a more objective decision making process [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Vulnerability assessments can help to identify which communities are the most vulnerable to climate change, where they are located, and what is driving this vulnerability [
