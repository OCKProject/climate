<p class="p">The distinction between exposure, sensitivity, and also adaptive capacity (AC) can be opaque. Fritzsche 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] recommend that exposure variables are strictly climatic phenomena, such as the magnitude, rate of change or variation in rainfall and temperature or meteorological events such as drought or flooding. Smit et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] argues that certain variables can be indicative of both exposure and sensitivity and suggests that clear boundaries between the two components do not exist. Whilst Caffrey et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] note that sensitivity and adaptive capacity can be combined to indicate “social vulnerability” [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. A recent study by Thiault et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] has applied the conceptual framework of vulnerability [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] but through a socio ecological lens in which they quantify the vulnerability of human and marine systems which are intricately connected, using small scale fishing communities in Moorea, French Polynesia as a case study. The ecological vulnerability is combined with the human societal vulnerability in order to spatially prioritise conservation efforts. The study uses primary data collection to characterize the households and develop the socio and ecological vulnerability indices based on the grouping of multiple indicators. Unlike our study the focus is not on a driver (climate change) of change, but rather on assessing how a complex and integrated system can be understood through interconnected vulnerability. Nonetheless, the attempts to include multiple indicators to capture the complexity of vulnerability are shared with our proposed approach. Therefore, what constitutes exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity is dependent upon the context of the question and the predefined definitions.
