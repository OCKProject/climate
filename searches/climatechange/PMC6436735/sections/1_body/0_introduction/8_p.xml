<p class="p">It has been noted that several studies have projected the future climate and assessed how this influences vulnerability [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] however, fewer attempts have been made to also project the future societal context of the community (adaptive capacity), as these indicators are often hard to predict and uncertain [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Likewise, high levels of uncertainty inhibit confidence in the prediction of natural hazards (exposure) which are by nature unstable and chaotic [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Thus, our study will not attempt to project changes in adaptive capacity or exposure, but instead assume that current levels of adaptive capacity and exposure will remain constant under the future climate change scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. We are therefore focusing on how a future high emission climate scenario will affect the suitability of key agricultural crops, and how the exposure to natural hazards and the communities ability to respond (adaptive capacity) under current conditions will manifest itself as vulnerability. The output of vulnerability assessments can be at a resolution equivalent to national [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] depending on the context of the study and available data.
