<p class="p">The approach to vulnerability used in this study develops upon the assertions of Turner et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] that vulnerability is determined by the degree to which a system will experience stress due to a given pressure or combination of pressures. In our case the pressures are framed within the conceptual framework of vulnerability as a function of sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Exposure, is deemed to be the combination of different natural hazards, sensitivity is the projected changes in the climate (precipitation and temperature) and the impacts on climatic suitability for key agricultural crops, and adaptive capacity is the socio-economic standing of the community, and how well they are able to deal with the potential impact (Exposure and Sensitivity).
