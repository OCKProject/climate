<p class="p">A number of studies have used spatial analysis and geographic information systems (GIS) to quantify vulnerability to climate change (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). For example, at the global level vulnerability assessments have been used to identify which countries are more vulnerable to climate change shocks that affect a specific industry, such as fisheries [
