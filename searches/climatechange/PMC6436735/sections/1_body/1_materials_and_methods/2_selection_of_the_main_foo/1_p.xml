<p class="p">In order to prioritize which crops to include in the CRVA (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), we used an existing methodology [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] which identifies and prioritizes which crops are most important to food security for a given country, based on the following set of indicators: harvested area; net production value (NPV), gross production value (GPV), contribution to national and agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) and calories intake (kcal/ capita/ day). These indicators help establish the relevance of the crop production system for the countryâ€™s economy and food security. As a first option to collect this data we used the national statistics census and in the case that is does not exist or is not available we used FAOSTAT [
