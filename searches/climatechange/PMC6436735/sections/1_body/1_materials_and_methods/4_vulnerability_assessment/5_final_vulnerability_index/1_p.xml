<p class="p">We finally use the combination of the normalized natural hazards, adaptive capacity and sensitivity (crop specific) to calculate the overall vulnerability at the administrative boundary scale described before. When data on harvested area for each crop is available (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), it is possible to weight the sensitivity component by the ratio of harvest area of that particular crop to the total harvested area of the cropping system. We used this weighted equation for Vietnam in order to give more importance to the final overall vulnerability to prioritise where the crop is present and grown in greater quantities (harvested area). Data for harvested area was not available for Uganda or Nicaragua at the sub county level. We present the equation used to calculate the overall vulnerability in Vietnam. The analysis was conducted in ArcGIS 10.3 software (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, California). The overall vulnerability is determined by equally weighted contribution of potential impact (
