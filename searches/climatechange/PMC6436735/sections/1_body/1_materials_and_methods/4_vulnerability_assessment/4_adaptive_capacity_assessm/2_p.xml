<p class="p">The adaptive capacity index’s resolution corresponds to the finest resolution of all the indicators used and drives the resolution of the overall vulnerability output. For each variable of adaptive capacity, there are many indicators that can be used depending on data limitation or the adopted definitions in the country of interest. In the case of Vietnam (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s005" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>), adaptive capacity is divided into 5 variables (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>); whilst in Uganda a total of 4 variables were included, as a lack of data on organizational capacity prevented its inclusion. The datasets used to capture adaptive capacity cover the full extent of the respective country and are available at a resolution that enables sub national analysis (

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In the aforementioned study adaptive capacity was mapped as a function of three conditions: satisfaction of basic needs, resources for innovation and resources for transforming innovation into actions. A series of indicators were compiled (

The indicators were normalized with values linearly to a 0–1 interval based on their minimum and maximum values in each municipality in order to avoid biases due to wide variations of socioeconomic development [
