<p class="p">We divide exposure into two components: exposure 1 refers to the changes in temperature and precipitation between current conditions and the future projection (decade 2050). To estimate the current conditions we use Worldclim, a set of global climatic layers that utilise weather stations from sources such as the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) and FAO, with records dating from 1950 to 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Using the thin plate spine algorithm [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] the climate data has been interpolated at a spatial resolution of 2.5 arc-minutes (~ 5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at the equator) for monthly total rainfall, and maximum, mean and minimum temperature. For the future climate data we use the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP), characterised by increasing green-house gas emissions, high rates of population growth, modest GDP growth and low rates of technological development and uptake [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. This is the most severe (~1370 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> eq by 2100) of the future scenarios which were documented in The Fifth Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] of the IPCC. The future period selected for this study is the decade 2050 (representing 204–2069), corresponding to a medium term horizon [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>]. In order to simulate the future climate and atmosphere we used the mean ensemble of 32 General Circulation Models (GCMs) under RCP 8.5. The spatial resolution of GCMs is too coarse to analyse the direct impacts on farmers’ production. We therefore used downscaled data based on the sum of interpolated anomalies for each GCM against the current climate baseline data [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>], creating a smoothed climate surface at 2.5 arc minutes for future climate conditions. The changes in precipitation and temperature were estimated by subtracting current to future climate, using the downscaled datasets in order to describe changes in temperature and precipitation.
