<p class="p">Second, exposure 2 includes natural hazards (sea level rise, flooding, drought and tropical cyclones) and hazardous processes (soil erosion and land degradation) which are deemed to present significant risk to the agricultural sector [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] and have been used in previous studies to develop disaster risk and vulnerability indexes [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. We do not model the aforementioned hazards and instead rely on previous studies that developed spatially aggregated datasets (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). A number of those included (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) are acquired from the Global Data Risk Platform [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref088" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>] which provides spatially referenced hazard data at a high resolution and extensive coverage. In regards to flooding and drought, the climate risks are derived from historical records and statistical modelling that spatially infers extreme events that go beyond the natural variability in the system [
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. Due to the different geographical and meteorological contexts of the respective case study countries, the selection of which natural hazard variables to include requires literature review and validation from local experts. The approach to Exposure 2 varied between the three case studies. In Vietnam, we undertook a workshop in Hanoi, attended by agronomists from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), representatives from our government partners, notably the Institute of Agriculture and Environment (IAE) and the National Institute of Agricultural Planning and Projection (NIAPP), the Institute of Geography from the University of Science and Technology also attended, as did a number of non-governmental organizations including the Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE) and the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO). The attendees brought a variety of focuses and expertise that covered the length and breadth of Vietnam and this was necessary to ensure accurate validation of our input data. During this workshop we undertook an exercise with the participants to confirm which of the natural hazards (exposure) affects each of the respective crops (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0213641.s007" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The natural hazard data is spatially explicit and covers the full extent of Vietnam (
 <xref rid="pone.0213641.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We used this information to create exposure specific indexes for each of the crops. The purpose was to develop a more refined Potential Impact indices by focusing on the relevant natural hazards that affect the respective cropping system. In the case of Uganda and Nicaragua, meetings were undertaken with experts and government partners to identify natural hazards and also identify suitable datasets, but due to limited access to agronomists on the respective crops, the crop specific exposure index was not calculated. Therefore, we assumed that the respective natural hazards (
