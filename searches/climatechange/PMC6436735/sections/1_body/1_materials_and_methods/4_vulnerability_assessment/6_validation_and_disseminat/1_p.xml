<p class="p">In the case of Vietnam and Nicaragua expert validation was obtained at various stages of the vulnerability methodology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213641.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). In Vietnam a planning workshop with government partners, agronomists and stakeholders provided feedback on the indicators (datasets) used to determine the components of vulnerability. In the case of Nicaragua experts were consulted in order to obtain the indicators of adaptive capacity. In the case of Uganda, time constraints and data limitations meant that the same level of scrutiny of the data was not undertaken. Therefore the results for Uganda should be shared with experts in order to gauge the reliability of the input data. Finally, the combination of the indicators within the three components of vulnerability was undertaken without weighting due to a lack of production data, expertise on the importance of each indicator and limited feedback from crop experts.
