<p class="p">Using the latest available data and crop models we have captured the sensitivity of the key crops to climate change, integrated exposure from natural hazards which affect agricultural systems and rural areas, and adopted a broad number of indicators to represent the adaptive capacity of the population, in order to provide a clearer understanding of agricultural vulnerability to climate change. We have built upon previous studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] through the integration of natural hazards into the exposure component of vulnerability. The proposed CRVA offer a means to more objectively prioritise climate change adaptation policies which are strategically targeted to the most vulnerable rural communities. This is particularly important due to the limited technical and financial resources available to confront the mammoth impacts of climate change on rural communities in developing tropical countries.
