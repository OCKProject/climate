  <p class="p">The MaxEnt Model [
   <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>] was used for selected crops when accurate presence data was available, or if the crop is predominantly irrigated, such is the case of Rice in Vietnam [
   <xref rid="pone.0213641.ref111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">111</xref>] or grown at particular elevational ranges, for example, coffee Arabica in Nicaragua and coffee Robusta in Vietnam. The Ecocrop model was used when geographic distribution data (presence data) was not available or reliable. The natural hazards were selected and verified by experts in Vietnam and Nicaragua.
