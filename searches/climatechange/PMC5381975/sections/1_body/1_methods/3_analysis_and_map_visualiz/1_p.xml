<p class="p">We compared the outputs of the model runs with output from San Juan for each site. The analysis results are indicative of one of two possibilities for each location: 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) transmission in the mainland U.S. site occurs at the same level as that in San Juan, indicating that the climate is suitable for transmission, but socioeconomic factors, lack of importation, or other unaccounted-for factors are limiting transmission; or 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) dengue transmission in the mainland U.S. site is significantly reduced or absent compared with that in San Juan, suggesting that the site climate is not suitable for epidemic dengue. By repeating these steps for the future climate scenarios, we also assessed future transmission potential for each location.
