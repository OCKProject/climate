<p class="p">We produced time series for the future climate scenario by calculating GCM ensemble–projected average monthly changes in temperature (absolute) and precipitation (proportion) between the GCM-simulated baseline (1961–1990) and future (2045–2065) periods. We used the closest location for which the GCMs (1.3–3.9° resolution) were run to apply the changes in LARS for each site to the synthetic time series in order to create 21 years of downscaled, daily time series of site-specific future midcentury climate conditions (2046–2056). We applied the same procedure to generate comparable baseline data to use in place of the observed data. We used an ensemble of 15 GCMs (

The projections used the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) SRA1B Special Report on Emissions scenario, which assumes “[a] future world of very rapid economic growth, global population that peaks in mid-century and declines thereafter, and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies, with the development balanced across energy sources” (
