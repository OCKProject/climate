Future climate change data were accessed from GCM data housed in the statistical weather generator LARS-WG5 (LARS) (
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rothamsted Research 2016</xref>). Daily-level data from GCMs are not directly comparable to observed daily data; therefore, we used LARS to produce a comparable series. LARS uses historical data to create a new synthetic time series that is statistically similar to the observed data at each site, enabling translation between monthly and daily time scales. We evaluated the observed and synthetic time series to assess the software’s ability to reproduce realistic daily data. The daily probability distributions (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test) and monthly means (Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test) for precipitation, minimum, and maximum temperatures for each site showed only one statistically significant value (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01; Jackson, MS, September minimum temperature). The minimal significance differences between the observed and synthetic data sets for these values suggests that the synthetic time series reasonably capture the overall patterns of the observed data sets.
