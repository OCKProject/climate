<p class="p">The impacts of climate and climate change on infectious disease dynamics, distribution, and spread have been the subject of significant discussion (

 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harvell et al. 2002</xref>). Dengue fever, caused by a virus spread predominantly by 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes, is emblematic of a disease whose rapid expansion may be partly fueled by changing climatic conditions. 
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bhatt et al. (2013)</xref> estimated that the four dengue serotypes (DEN-1, 2, 3, 4) cause 390 million annual infections, 96 million of which are symptomatic, representing a significant global disease burden. Therefore, understanding links between local and global climate and weather patterns and disease outbreaks is an important topic of inquiry.
