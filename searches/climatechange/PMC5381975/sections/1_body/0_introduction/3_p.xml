<p class="p">Meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation affect the biophysical functioning of the mosquito and the breeding habitat (e.g., 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Christophers 1960</xref>). Precipitation can increase vector density by providing breeding habitat (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moore et al. 1978</xref>), and temperature affects mosquito hatching rate, development time (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mohammed and Chadee 2011</xref>), and survival (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tun-Lin et al. 2000</xref>). Temperature further influences virus transmission dynamics by shortening the extrinsic incubation period (EIP). 
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watts et al. (1987)</xref> reported that the EIP for the DEN-2 serotype declines from 12 days at temperatures ≤ 30°C to 7 days at 32–35°C. Similarly, 
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rohani et al. (2009)</xref> noted that mosquitoes became infectious with DEN-2 and DEN-4 at day 5 at 30°C, 4 days sooner than mosquitoes held at 26°C and 28°C. A shorter EIP heightens the transmission potential to humans and the outbreak intensity (

 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patz et al. 1998</xref>). These biophysical processes underpin the links between climate variability and observed dengue fever cases across multiple spatiotemporal scales (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cazelles et al. 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gagnon et al. 2001</xref>;

 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Johansson et al. 2009</xref>) and have led to concerns that virus transmission may increase in regions where it has until now been uncommon (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patz et al. 1998</xref>). Recent empirical work in Mexico found a decreasing number of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> with increased elevation along an altitudinal transect (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lozano-Fuentes et al. 2012</xref>). That study also found populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> at higher elevations in Mexico than previously recorded within the country. Collectively, the results suggest the possibility of future temperature-induced 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> expansion into areas beyond current geographical boundaries.
