<p class="p">We conducted additional analysis on Key West, Florida, and Brownsville, Texas, because both have had recent dengue cases (see 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bouri et al. 2012</xref>) but have contrasting climate characteristics. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows dengue cases at these sites as a percentage of total cases in Puerto Rico, along with plotted climate data. Presently, Key West climate conditions are more favorable for transmission than those in San Juan during the summer (weeks 30–44), with the window widening to weeks 27–51 under the future scenario. Our modeled output data showed, on average, low but continual transmission throughout the winter in San Juan. However, this year-round transmission is not maintained in Key West or Brownsville (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The climate data in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> show that San Juan has a smaller annual temperature range than these two sites, with warmer winter temperatures capable of supporting year-round transmission. Conversely, cooler winter conditions are likely to prevent or limit transmission in Key West, even under future climate conditions. Estimates show a similar pattern for Brownsville, but with a shorter time window for transmission that does not currently exceed that of San Juan. However, transmission is projected to increase in future climate scenarios, exceeding current case numbers in San Juan during the summer (weeks 27–35). Nevertheless, temperatures remain substantially cooler than in San Juan during fall and winter, thus limiting the potential for year-round transmission.
