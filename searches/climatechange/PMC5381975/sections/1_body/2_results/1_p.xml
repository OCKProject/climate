<p class="p">Our estimates suggest that under baseline climate conditions, dengue transmission may be possible in several sites in the southeast United States (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The estimated transmission potential was highest during summer (Julyâ€“September), although some locations in Florida and Texas may have transmission during the spring and fall as well. In addition, our estimates suggest that southern Florida is as climatically capable of supporting dengue transmission as Puerto Rico during the summer months, denoted by estimated values that are 100% of values estimated for San Juan. Absent caseloads during the winter at all 23 sites suggest that for all locations, the current winter temperatures are too low to allow virus transmission. However, our estimates suggest that mosquito populations during the winter in southern Florida may be only slightly lower than mosquito populations in San Juan (
