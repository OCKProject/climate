<p class="p">In all locations considered, and for both current and future scenarios, the projected time window for dengue transmission is shorter than the seasonal time window for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> populations. Studies show that the EIP shortens as temperatures rise &gt; 26°C (

 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> is as low as 20°C (

 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Christophers 1960</xref>). Our results suggest that conditions favorable to the virus (when simulated dengue cases occur) only arise during the warmest times of the year, likely because of the lengthening of the EIP at lower temperatures. Furthermore, our model suggests that even in locations where mosquitos may survive year-round, such as southern Florida, temperatures are too low to permit dengue transmission during an infected mosquito’s lifespan during much of the year. Therefore, outbreaks occur only when dengue is reintroduced during favorable conditions, that is to say, when the length of the EIP is shorter than the lifespan of the mosquito. In most U.S. locations, dengue outbreaks are rare because this potential time window is very short, whereas cases are more common in southern Texas and Florida, where the time window for conditions that favor transmission is longer.
