<p class="p">Case studies have shown that the spatial distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> is heterogeneous within cities and regions (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayden et al. 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Murray et al. 2013</xref>). We have attempted to account for this heterogeneity by using the average from 96 different parameterizations that were selected to optimize model performance based on an analysis of data from Puerto Rico. Nevertheless, it remains possible that some locations in our study may have different spatial patterns of breeding sites than those captured in the San Juan validation, and readers should keep in mind that these results were modeled using San Juan parameters. Further field studies are needed to quantify the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> across U.S. urban landscapes.
