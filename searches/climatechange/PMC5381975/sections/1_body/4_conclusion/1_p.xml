 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum (2012)</xref> noted a lack of studies quantifying the links between climate and human health; this is particularly true for analyses of future dengue fever in the southeastern United States. We used a dynamic modeling approach to estimate future impacts of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and dengue cases in the United States. Our results highlight the potential influence of climate on both the vector and the virus. Some locations may see an increase in both disease risk and vector abundance, whereas others may see an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> populations but remain on the fringe of dengue transmission. Our estimates suggest that the dengue transmission window is narrower than the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> season length at all of the locations evaluated, consistent with stringent climatic limitations on the virus. Although social and public health infrastructure play an important role in preventing transmission, this research shows that current climatic conditions may also be limiting the virus. Our findings indicate that it is too cold during the winter months for viral transmission to be sustained under present mainland U.S. climate conditions. If so, virus reintroduction is required for dengue outbreaks to occur. However, future climate changes may expand the transmission potential in the southeastern United States, making dengue a public health challenge in the future.
