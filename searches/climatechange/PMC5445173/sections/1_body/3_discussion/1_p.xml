<p class="p">Results of this study show that outcomes of fungal infections may vary between current environmental conditions and future climate change predictions in the Norway spruce â€“ 
 <italic class="italic">E. polonica</italic> pathosystem. While the most distant and severe projections were the most detrimental to tree health overall, this trend masked substantial between-strain variation in responses to the projected climate scenarios. This is the first experimental evaluation of climate change effects on this pathosystem, and indicates potential implications for future forestry productivity in northern Europe.
