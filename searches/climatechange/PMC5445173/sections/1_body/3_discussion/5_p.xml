Outbred seedlings were used for the present study, representing the natural genetic diversity that is currently employed in boreal forestry practices. Monocultures of resistant clones would provide a possible solution to combat specific infection risk. However, the subsequent lack of genetic diversity would also introduce other risks to tree health, specifically the ability to respond to unanticipated environmental perturbations such as droughts and other infections (
