<p class="p">Forestry is a major economic industry in northern Europe. Much research has addressed the effects of projected climate changes on tree species distributions and their productivity (

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lévesque et al., 2013</xref>), while the potential impacts of pests and pathogens have received far less attention. Our results highlight the need to incorporate disease effects into future forestry planning. They suggest that predicted climate changes have the potential to alter the damage caused to Norway spruce by the fungus

However, we acknowledge the multifaceted effects of climate change on plant-pathogen interactions. Factors such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), gaseous emissions and radiation may have important influences (
