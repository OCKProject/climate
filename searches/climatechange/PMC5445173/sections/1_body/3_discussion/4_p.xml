However, this hypothesis calls for future targeted research addressing indices of plant immunity. Although conifers have highly evolved defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krokene et al., 2013</xref>), several climate change factors are likely to contribute to plant stress and thereby impair their defenses (
