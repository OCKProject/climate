In this study, the lesion length indices were effective general predictors for seedling mortality, with sapwood lesion length the most accurate. By also evaluating mortality, which was facilitated by the high seedling numbers, we uncovered substantial within-strain discordance between the lesion indices and mortality counts. For example, the mortality count was greater under the 2100 climate scenario than ambient conditions for seedlings infected with fungi F5, but none of the lesion indices differed between the two climate scenarios. These results thus indicate a need for caution when extrapolating lesion indices as more general outcomes of plant health. From a practical point of view, mortality occurred in 25% of seedlings inoculated with fungal strain F5 (compared to 0% without fungal infection). Twenty-five percentage of stand loss alone will have severe economic implications, and we found that mortality levels approached 50% under the 2100 climate scenario (
