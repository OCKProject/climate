<p class="p">All of the fungal strains used in this study were pathogenic, and able to induce greater seedling damage than the mock-inoculations. Most fungal strains were from the same locality (

 </bold>), are thus consistent with previous observations that

 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sall√© et al., 2005</xref>). The bark beetle vector is able to disperse over long distances (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forsse and Solbreck, 1985</xref>), and thereby accumulate fungal assemblages from diverse geographical areas. However, this finding highlights problems associated with generalizing results across and within pathogen and host species, and thus the need for targeted system-based research.
