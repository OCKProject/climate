<p class="p">One of the most important pests of Norway spruce in Europe is the Eurasian spruce bark beetle (
 <italic class="italic">Ips typographus</italic>). Like many insect species, the bark beetle is highly responsive to changes in temperature (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Björkman and Niemelä, 2015</xref>), and a warming climate has already had observable effects on its development and voltinism (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jönsson et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Økland et al., 2015</xref>). The beetle has a symbiotic association with several fungi for which it serves as a vector (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Seifert et al., 2013</xref>). The most pathogenic fungus associated with the Eurasian spruce bark beetle is 
 <italic class="italic">Endoconidiophora polonica</italic>, which is capable of killing mature Norway spruce trees (

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krokene and Solheim, 1998</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirisits and Offenthaler, 2002</xref>). It is not known how projected climate changes will influence the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">E. polonica</italic> on tree health or its ability to facilitate colonization by the bark beetle.
