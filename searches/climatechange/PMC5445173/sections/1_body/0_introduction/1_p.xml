 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trumbore et al., 2015</xref>). Pathogens and pests represent some of the most important threats to forest health where climate change is occurring (

These factors are recognized as an increasing concern worldwide, but an understanding of how systems will respond to climate change, and the associated need to enact mitigation strategies, is hindered by a lack of empirical research.
