<p class="p">The experiment was conducted during the 2015 thermal growing season (between 9 June and 28 October) at the Haapastensyrjä field station of the Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke) in southern Finland. This area is characterized by a semi-continental climate. During the experimental period, the mean daily temperature ranged from 4 to 15°C, consistent with long-term averages. The exception occurred in August – September, which was approximately 1.5°C warmer than the long-term mean (
