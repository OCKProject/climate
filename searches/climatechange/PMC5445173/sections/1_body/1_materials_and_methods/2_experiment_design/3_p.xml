<p class="p">The two temperature-controlled seedling groups were maintained in separate compartments of a large greenhouse, where the DGT-Volmatic system monitored outside temperatures and increased the greenhouse room temperatures accordingly. The control seedlings were maintained alongside the greenhouse, and were thus subject to very similar conditions to those in the climate scenario treatment groups (including natural day length, with temperature and CO

The inoculation experiment started at the beginning of July and was concluded 12 weeks later, in October 2015, to encompass the thermal growing season in the region. During the experiment, seedlings were watered as required to maintain moist soil (usually three times a week). No additional fertilization was given. The trays were rotated every 3 weeks to minimize potential effects due to their positioning.
