<p class="p">Seedling inoculations were made approximately half way up the stems (on the 1st-year shoot) by cutting a bark flap (3 Ã— 4 mm) with a sterile scalpel (

 </bold>). An inoculum of approximately the same size was cut from the actively growing outer zone of the culture plate, and placed onto the wound with the mycelial surface facing the exposed sapwood region. The inoculum site was then covered with the bark flap and sealed with Parafilm to prevent contamination and desiccation. The Parafilm was removed 2 weeks later. Mock-inoculations were made in the same way, but using sterile 2% MEA as inoculum. All inoculations were performed by the same person (RL) to increase uniformity.
