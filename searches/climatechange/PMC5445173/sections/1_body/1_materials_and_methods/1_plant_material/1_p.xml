<p class="p">A total of 450 (2-year-old) Norway spruce seedlings (Fin Forelia Oy, Nurmijärvi) originating from Imatra, Southern Finland (61° 09′ N, 28° 048′ E) were used. Average seedling height at the beginning of the experiment was 40 cm. Seedlings were potted into plastic trays of 36 cells (Plantek 36 F), each 64 mm × 64 mm × 90 mm (depth), filled with fertilized peat (Vapo peat for forest trees). Plant density in the trays was 240 plants/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. All seedlings were maintained in a greenhouse (mean temperature 14.8°C) for 1 week and then transferred to treatment conditions (see below), where they were acclimatized for ∼4 weeks prior to fungal inoculations.
