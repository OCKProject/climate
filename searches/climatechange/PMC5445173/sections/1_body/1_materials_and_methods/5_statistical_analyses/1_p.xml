<p class="p">General linear mixed models (GLMM) were constructed to evaluate the effects of the climate change scenarios on bark and sapwood lesion lengths and depth at the experiment conclusion. Due to inherent imprecision in measuring lesion length/depth in dead wood, seedlings that died throughout the experiment (53 seedlings) were excluded from the analyses. Significant outliers were removed (Grubbâ€™s test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) and data were natural log transformed (lesion lengths) to approximate normality. Initial explanatory variables for the bark and sapwood lesion length models were seedling height at the onset of the experiment (continuous variable), climate change scenario, fungal inoculation strain (both categorical variables), and all interactions. Seedling tray number (categorical), position in the tray (three categories; rows/columns ranging from the outside to the interior) and the intercept were set as random factors. The same model was conducted for lesion depth, with seedling height replaced by stem diameter. Since the lesions of mock-inoculated seedlings very rarely extended inward from the inoculation point (only two very minor cases were identified), these data were removed from the analyses. All models were sequentially reduced, whereby non-significant interaction terms were removed if their removal did not increase AIC by &gt; 2 units (
