<p class="p">Pearson correlation tests were used to assess the relationship between outer bark and xylem sapwood lesion length, lesion depth and seedling mortality. For these comparisons, the estimated marginal means of bark and sapwood lesion length (from the seedling height adjusted model) and lesion depth for each climate change scenario/strain combination were compared against each other and the respective group seedling mortality counts. Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, United States).</p>
