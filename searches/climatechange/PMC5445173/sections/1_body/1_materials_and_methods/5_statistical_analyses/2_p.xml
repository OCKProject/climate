<p class="p">To facilitate interpretation of a three-way interaction between seedling height at the onset of the experiment, fungal strain and climate change scenario in the sapwood lesion length model (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">climate scenario × fungal strain × beg_height 10,357</sub> = 1.81, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.057), a mixed model was constructed with sapwood lesion length explained by height at the onset of the experiment. Tray number, position in the tray and the intercept were again set as random factors. The residuals of this model were then used as the response variable in a linear mixed model in which sapwood lesion length was explained by fungal strain, climate change scenario and their interaction, as per the methods described above.
