<p class="p">Seedling height was measured at the beginning and end of the experiment (to the nearest 0.5 cm) and seedlings were monitored for mortality at monthly intervals (four monitoring occasions throughout the experiment). Mortality was defined as discoloration of all needles above the inoculation point, consistent with previous studies (
