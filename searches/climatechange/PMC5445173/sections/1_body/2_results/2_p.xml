<p class="p">For seedlings inoculated with fungal strain F5, mortality varied based on the climate change scenario (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.011) and 2030 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.050) climate change scenarios than ambient conditions. No difference was detected between 2030 and 2100 climate change scenarios. Conversely, no variation in seedling mortality occurred under climate change scenarios using the F4 fungal strain (

 <bold class="bold">Figure

 </bold>). For strain F1, mortality was greater in the 2100 climate change scenario than ambient conditions (Fisherâ€™s exact test, two-sided 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.022), but did not vary between 2030 and 2100 or between ambient conditions and the 2030 climate change scenario. No mortality differences were detected between climate change scenarios for seedlings inoculated with strains F2 or F3 (
