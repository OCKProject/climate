 </bold>) and lesion depth (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3C</xref>
 </bold>) all varied based on the interaction between climate change scenario and the fungal strain. A suite of within-strain differences in lesion length and depth due to climate change scenarios were identified, which are indicated in the figures. Lesion depth increased with seedling diameter (
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>). Bark and sapwood lesion lengths were greater across all fungal strains than with mock-inoculations (statistical comparison was not possible for lesion depth, as lesions from mock-inoculations rarely extended into the sapwood). Mean sapwood lesion length (35.60 mm, range 4.9 – 139.4 mm) was longer than the mean bark lesion length (13.7 mm, range 4.5 – 36.0 mm).
