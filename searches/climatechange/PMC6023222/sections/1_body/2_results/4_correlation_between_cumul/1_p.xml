 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref> implies that the annual cumulative number of infected mosquitoes and the temperature exhibit a strong relationship. To investigate this further, we compute the correlation between the annual cumulative number of infected mosquitoes and the temperature based on the two RCP scenarios. This correlation is commonly used to measure the strength of an association between two variables. As the value of the correlation coefficient approaches 1, the relationship between the two variables becomes stronger, and the directions of the relationship are sign + and sign −, which indicate a positive and negative relationship, respectively. We carry out two measures of non-parametric rank correlations: Spearman’s
