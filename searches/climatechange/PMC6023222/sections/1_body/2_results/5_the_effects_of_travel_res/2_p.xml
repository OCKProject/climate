<p class="p">We explore the effects of travel restriction and vector controls on cumulative dengue cases for vectors and humans. First, the results for the single-strain model are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>. In the upper left subfigure of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref>, the annual cumulative incidences for vectors and humans are displayed using three different levels of travel restriction controls (
 <italic class="italic">u</italic> = 0: no control, 
 <italic class="italic">u</italic> = 0.5 and 
 <italic class="italic">u</italic> = 0.9: 50% and 90% reduction in the travel inflow rate, respectively). Clearly, the annual cumulative incidence decreases as 
 <italic class="italic">u</italic> increases. Moreover, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref> illustrates the results under combined control scenarios (travel restrictions and vector controls). Combined control is highly effective. Even a 0.5% increase in the vector control leads to a significant reduction in the annual cumulative incidence of humans (see the top panels with 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> = 0.005). Moreover, the average 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 </sub> over all months decreases to under 1 as 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic> increases to 2%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref> display the effects of both controls on cumulative dengue cases in the two-strain model. These results indicate that the implementation of both intensive controls reduces the number of dengue cases dramatically. Therefore, travel restrictions alone are insufficient, and must be combined with vector controls.
