<p class="p">In this section, we investigate the impact of various RCP scenarios on infectious mosquitoes and infectious humans for 50 years from June 1, 2020. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> shows the time evolution of infectious mosquitoes and the human incidence for the single-strain model. This demonstrates that dengue outbreaks for humans and mosquitoes exhibit recurrent seasonal patterns. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0199205.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> depicts the annual cumulative number of infectious mosquitoes and the cumulative number of infectious humans over the 50 years in the single-strain model. This shows that higher-numbered RCP scenarios exhibit a tendency towards higher annual cumulative numbers of both infectious mosquitoes and humans on a long-term scale.
