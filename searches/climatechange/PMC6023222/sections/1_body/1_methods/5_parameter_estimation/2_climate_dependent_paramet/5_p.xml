<p class="p">In the winter season, especially when the temperature is below 10 °
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>, the biting and transmissible rates are almost zero, and the mortality rate of adult mosquitoes is high. Thus, during this time period (below 10 °
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>), virus transmission rarely occurs between vectors and humans, although infected humans can still be present owing to infected international travelers returning from outside of South Korea.
