<p class="p">Most of the modeling studies on dengue transmission associated with climate factors have focused on investigating the effects of temperature on the disease transmission [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. In this work, we incorporated the effects of rainfall as well as the temperature into our models. In particular, mosquito larvae inhabit bodies of water such as rivers, lakes, ponds, and swamps, and their mortality rate depends strongly on the amount of rainfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Thus, in our models we represented the larval mortality rate as a function of the amount of rainfall, so that the rainfall can affect the dynamics of dengue transmission.
