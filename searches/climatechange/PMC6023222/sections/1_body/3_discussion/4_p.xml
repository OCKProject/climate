<p class="p">Our study focused on Jeju Island, which has a warmer climate than other parts of South Korea. Thus, Jeju Island has a higher chance of having a favorable climate for

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. RCP scenario-based climate data for all city areas in Korea are currently provided by the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), and using these data the modeling approach presented in this paper could also be used to investigate the potential risks of dengue outbreak associated with climate change in other areas, such as subtropical southern city areas in Korea other than Jeju. Recent research has shown that over 20% of mosquitoes collected in South Korea are 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, and in particular the proportions of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes in park or hill areas are higher than those in dwelling areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Thus, one possible application of our modeling approach and a direction for our future work is motivated by the recent domestic dengue outbreak in Yoyogi Park, Tokyo, Japan [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. This would consist of developing a two-patch model of dengue transmission [
