<p class="p">Using the developed models, we illustrated the impact of climate change on the dynamics of dengue transmission in Jeju Island under various RCP scenarios provided by the KMA. Based on the RCP scenarios, the potential risk of dengue outbreak was assessed via the vectorial capacity (VC) over the next 50 years. We found that the intensity of the VC increases for higher RCP scenarios, which implies that the increase in average temperature owing to climate change may trigger a major dengue outbreak in Korea. It was also observed that the cumulative incidence of dengue mosquitoes and the temperature based on RCP scenarios exhibit a strong positive correlation. In particular, in case of RCP 8.5 a gradual increase in the temperature was predicted over the next 50 years, and massive dengue outbreaks may occur if adequate controls are not implemented. Concerning the controls of dengue transmission, we investigated the effects of controls for adult mosquitoes and infected travelers. If the cost-effectiveness of the two controls can be computed in future work, this would be of further help to the disease prevention authorities in implementing timely and effective control measures.</p>
