<p class="p">Recently, the climate of South Korea has changed from a warm temperate climate to a subtropical climate [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and this will make South Korea environmentally suited to the life cycles of mosquitos in the near future [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In particular, dengue fever is predicted to be one of the most likely infectious diseases to threaten public health in Korea [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Recently, Japan, which is a neighboring country of Korea, has suffered an unexpected autochthonous dengue outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In the case of Korea, no indigenous dengue case has occurred so far, and all cases of infection have been diagnosed in travelers returning from endemic countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, it has been reported that the imported dengue cases in Korea and Japan exhibit a similar pattern [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and the climate change and growing tendency in dengue cases for overseas travelers may trigger an autochthonous outbreak in South Korea [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no prior modeling study concerning the risk analysis for autochthonous dengue outbreaks associated with climate change in South Korea.
