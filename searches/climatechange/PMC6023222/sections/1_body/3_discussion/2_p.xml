<p class="p">In order to investigate the risk of autochthonous dengue outbreaks in South Korea, we first constructed dengue transmission models for primary and secondary infections with climate-dependent parameters. These climate-dependent parameters were estimated from previous studies (experimental data and actual dengue cases). To estimate the transmission probabilities between mosquitoes and humans, we used dengue incidence data from Taiwan, because there have not yet been any indigenous dengue cases in Korea. The transmission probabilities could be estimated more accurately if indigenous dengue cases in Korea occur in the future.</p>
