<p class="p">In this paper, we developed dengue transmission models for primary and secondary infections with climate-dependent parameters to incorporate global warming effects into vector dynamics. We explored the impact of climate change on dengue transmission dynamics under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Moreover, we assessed the potential risks for dengue outbreaks via vectorial capacity and intensity, and we derived a formula for the seasonal reproduction number

 </sub>, which can be useful for analyzing the effects of climate change on the dengue transmission dynamics. Furthermore, we investigated the effects of controls by modifying two important factors of dengue transmission: the inflow rate of international travelers into Korea and the death rate of dengue mosquitoes. Controlling the inflow rate of infected international travelers is the main current control policy implemented by Korean governmental agents. However, controlling dengue mosquitoes in combination with the control of the inflow rate is highly effective. The results suggest that governmental agents should increase their efforts and budgets for controlling
