<p class="p">In South Korea, 1,331 cases of dengue fever were reported in the period 2010â€“2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and all infected people were travelers who returned from endemic countries such as Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Several studies demonstrated that the risk of an autochthonous dengue outbreak increases as international travel to endemic areas increases [

 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes have been found on Jeju Island, which has a humid subtropical climate and is warmer than other regions in Korea [

 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], and the inflow of travelers to the island has recently increased [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], the potential for autochthonous dengue transmission on Jeju Island is greater than in other regions of Korea. Therefore, we formulate single-strain and two-strain dengue transmission models with a focus on Jeju Island, and explore the impact of climate change on the dengue transmission dynamics under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. Furthermore, we assess the potential risks of dengue outbreaks via the vectorial capacity and intensity, and investigate the effects of control measures for infected humans and vectors.
