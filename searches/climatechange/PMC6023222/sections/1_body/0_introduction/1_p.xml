 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Dengue is endemic in more than 100 countries, including African, American, Asian, and Western Pacific countries with tropical climates. Dengue virus includes four serotypes (DEN 1-4), and DEN 2 and DEN 3 are prevalent in tropical countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0199205.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Infection with one serotype confers permanent immunity to that serotype, as well as temporary cross-immunity to other serotypes. Furthermore, people reinfected by other serotypes are at risk of developing more serious diseases such as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [
