<p class="p">To evaluate how the public sought information we monitored all English language Google searches (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://google.com/trends" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">google.com/trends</ext-link>), taking into account the specific topics the public sought information on, by hour for February 25, 2016 through March 9, 2016. Google searches were divided between those primarily investigating the claims made by DiCaprio, including the exact terms “climate change”, “global warming,” “hottest year,” and “indigenous,” versus those investigating topics that are related to climate change, but were not mentioned by DiCaprio, including the exact terms “solar power,” “electric car,” “sea level rise,” and “carbon tax.” Searches were plotted on a relative search volume (the proportion of searches including the key terms relative to all searches scaled to a 0 to 100 scale where 100 is the highest search proportion) and absolute volumes were estimated using Google Adwords (
