<p class="p">Our study design was quasi-experimental, deriving a single estimate of the “DiCaprio effect” by comparing observed news, Twitter, and search volumes around DiCaprio’s speech to a counterfactual estimate representing expected news, Twitter, and search volumes had DiCaprio not advocated for climate change during the Oscars [
 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The observed volumes were derived from the time series. The counterfactual volumes were derived from an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, with components estimated using the algorithm developed by Hyndman and Khandakar [
 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. This model used historical data to estimate expected volumes for the time period after DiCaprio’s speech. These models are robust to the most well-known biases, including recurring periodicities and trending in the data, such as how the daily volume of tweets may be growing as Twitter’s user base grows. The ratio of observed and counterfactual volumes were calculated so as to represent the “effect” as a percent increase with confidence bounds (alpha = 0.05) estimated by using 10,000 random draws from the multivariate normal sampling distribution with mean equal to the maximum-likelihood point estimates, and variance equal to the variance-covariance matrix [
