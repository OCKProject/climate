<p class="p">Traditional top-down communication strategies—i.e., experts and organizations communicating with the public through planned events and campaigns—have predominated as the method for disseminating scientific evidence and promoting behavior change [
 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. These top-down frameworks typically expect that messages are more impactful when shared in the context of a planned campaign [
 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] and, in some cases, it is almost accepted that scientific evidence is only available and reliably disseminated “from the top.” For instance, many notable reviews, including for climate change communication strategies, do not consider the possibility of information retrieval and sharing outside of the context of a planned campaign [

 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, the example of DiCaprio and others demonstrates that dissemination can occur completely outside the context of a campaign and can even generate more public engagement than planned events. Moreover, in some cases, the scientific community is beginning to find that retaliatory messages from bottom-up communication channels (e.g., on Twitter) can eclipse, dilute, or reduce the efficacy of planned messages [
 <xref rid="pone.0159885.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Top-down frameworks are useful but communication strategies should be adapted to include a greater emphasis on bottom-up approaches where experts dedicate more resources to listening, dialoguing, and empowering the public who themselves can become advocates for change.
