  <title class="title">Hourly Google searches around DiCaprio’s Oscar speech.</title>
  <p class="p">Time trends show Google search volumes for the referenced focal terms, clustered according to those included (versus not included) in DiCaprio’s speech. Bar plots show estimated increases in each focal term, with estimates showing the day of DiCaprio’s speech (0) and subsequent days labeled as 1 through 5. Estimates were derived by comparing the observed volume to an empirical expectation of the counterfactual volume derived from forecasts using historical trends.</p>
