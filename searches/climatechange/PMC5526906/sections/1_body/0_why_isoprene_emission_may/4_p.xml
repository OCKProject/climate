<p class="p">Third, species from all taxonomic groups have spread around the world, mostly because of human activities. These biological invasions may alter the emission profile of volatiles. For instance, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Llusià et al. (2010)</xref> have found a lower emission of isoprenoids in native species growing in Hawaii, compared to co-occurring alien species. This was attributed to the lower emission potential of native species relative to aliens, within any given phylogenetic line, though further research is required to upscale this phenomenon. Similarly, tree genera characterized by extensive speciation and hybridization have been reported to emit isoprene more frequently than their phylogenetically nearest non-speciose genera (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dani et al., 2014</xref>). Isoprene, being highly volatile (Henry’s law constant of 7,780 Pa m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> mol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harley, 2013</xref>), is a ‘quick’ metabolite capable of improving photosynthetic performance under physiological (non-stressful) (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pollastri et al., 2014</xref>) and under transient, usually mild-to-moderate, stress conditions (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto and Fineschi, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maja et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it provides protection against generalist pests (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Llusià et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>); thus alien species, which lack specialist parasites, may greatly benefit from being emitters (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Laothawornkitkul et al., 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mithofer and Boland, 2012</xref>).
