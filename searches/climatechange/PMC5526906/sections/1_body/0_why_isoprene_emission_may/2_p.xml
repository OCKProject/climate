 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">United Nations, 2015</xref>), and growing megacities are hotspots of atmospheric gaseous and particulate pollutants, with economic, sanitary and social consequences (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baudic et al., 2016</xref>). For example, air pollution, particularly tropospheric O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and particulate matter, was responsible of 34,143, and 17,800 excess deaths, in Italy and France, respectively, during 2010 (

 <sub class="sub">x</sub>) concentration, isoprene can even lower tropospheric [O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>], when levels of NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> are high, a single isoprene molecule leads to the formation of several O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> molecules (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zeng et al., 2008</xref>). In urban areas, where NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> concentration is high (the so-called NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>-saturation regime), O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> production is highly responsive to VOCs (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ling et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, to limit O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> pollution in NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub>-saturated urban sites, policy actions aimed at reducing VOC emission may be more effective and easier to actuate than the policies aimed at decreasing NO
 <sub class="sub">x</sub> concentration (
