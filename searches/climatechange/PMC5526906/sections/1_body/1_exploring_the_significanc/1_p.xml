<p class="p">The functional reasons for Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> are still a matter of debate (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sharkey and Monson, 2017</xref>). It was hypothesized that isoprene biosynthesis (Iso
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>) evolved as an ancestral mechanism in plants adapted to high water availability, to cope with transient and recurrent oxidative stresses during their water-to-land transition (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vickers et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto et al., 2014</xref>). Consistently the tight association between Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> and species hygrophily suggests that Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> may be a favorable trait to cope with occasional exposure to stresses in mesic environments (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Harrison et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Monson et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto et al., 2014</xref>). Instead, xeric evergreen species inhabiting harsher environments, which require constitutive emissions over a longer time-scale level, generally produce compounds less volatile than isoprene, such as monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto and Fineschi, 2015</xref>). Fast-growing hygrophilous 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> species, such as most North American and some European oaks (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Q. robur</italic>) emit isoprene, whereas isoprene is replaced by monoterpenes in xeric oaks, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Q. ilex</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Q. suber</italic> (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto et al., 1998</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sharkey et al., 2008</xref>). This conforms the notion that marked differences in gene sequences encoding isoprene synthase have been found not only between plant groups, but also within each individual group (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dani et al., 2014</xref>), and suggests that environmental conditions may have contributed shaping the evolution of isoprenoid synthesis (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Monson et al., 2013</xref>).
