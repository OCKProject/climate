<p class="p">Several fast-growing, isoprene-emitting plants have moved to areas with harsher climate conditions than those of habitats they evolved (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Owen et al., 2013</xref>). In many instances, extended periods of rainfall scarcity, which usually occur in combination with high both solar irradiance and air temperature may pose serious challenges to plant survival, not only to the profitable production of biomass. Furthermore, the suite of morpho-anatomical traits (e.g., low tissue density, thin cuticle, large vessels, high vein density, see 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Reich, 2014</xref>) does not allow a conservative water use in hygrophilic mesophytes and their ability to withstand combined stress conditions may greatly depend on the so-called metabolic plasticity, which mostly involves secondary metabolites (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tattini et al., 2015</xref>). There is evidence that the biosynthesis of isoprenoids is stimulated via ROS-signaling (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fanciullino et al., 2014</xref>). This may help explain why the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, particularly of isoprene is generally uncoupled from photosynthesis (
