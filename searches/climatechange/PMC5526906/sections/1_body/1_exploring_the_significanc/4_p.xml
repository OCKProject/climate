<p class="p">In plants concurrently experiencing water and heat stress, stomatal closure reduces latent heat and exacerbates sensible heat load (

 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Velikova et al., 2016</xref>). These are the conditions under which isoprene biosynthesis is largely stimulated. Isoprene has been reported to enhance drought resistance of many fast-growing species, including tobacco and poplars. In all cases, isoprene-emitting lines showed reduced depression of photosynthesis, and less oxidative damage than non-emitting lines, when exposed to drought (
