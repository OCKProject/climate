<p class="p">Isoprene emission has been usually taken as a good estimate of Iso
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>, but Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> might largely differ from Iso
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>, e.g., as consequence of drought-induced declines in stomatal conductance (
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>). It has been hypothesized that stomata cannot control the emission of VOCs with high Henryâ€™s low constant, such as isoprene, even during rapid reductions in

  <sub class="sub">s</sub>
 </italic> (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Niinemets and Reichstein, 2003</xref>). If Iso
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> remains constant or even increases when stress induces stomatal closure, then the increased gradient between the internal and external concentration of isoprene should compensate for the increased resistance to isoprene outflow. However, under chronic or severe reductions of 
 <italic class="italic">g</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>, isoprene concentration inside the leaf (Iso
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>) largely exceeds Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Velikova et al., 2016</xref>), and Iso
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> might represent a more suitable estimate of Iso
 <sub class="sub">s</sub> compared to Iso
 <sub class="sub">e</sub> (
