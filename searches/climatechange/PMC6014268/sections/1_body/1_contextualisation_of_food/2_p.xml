<p class="p">It is worth pointing out that food availability is often used to measure food security; hence the concepts are often used interchangeably. Thompson, Berrange and Ford (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) clearly distinguish between the two by defining food availability in terms of the existence of sufficient quantities of food with appropriate quality. Similarly, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) defines food security in terms of three dimensions, namely food availability, food access and food use. The council suggests that a country must have sufficient quantities of food available on a consistent basis at both national and household level. Food access, on the other hand, refers to the ability of the nation and its households to acquire sufficient food on a sustainable basis (Aliber

 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), access to food refers to the ability of the country, communities and individuals to purchase food in sufficient quantities and quality. Another concept of food security involves food utilisation, which Negin et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) argue depends on how food is used, noting that although food availability and accessibility are necessary conditions for food utilisation, they are not sufficient conditions to reduce malnutrition. Wlokas (
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), on the other hand, argues that the direct impact of climate change on food security is through food availability due to changes in agricultural productivity. Similarly, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) reported that climate change affects the production rate and patterns of different food items.
