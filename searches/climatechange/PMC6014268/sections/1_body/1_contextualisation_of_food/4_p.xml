<p class="p">From the preceding concepts, food security can briefly be defined in terms of food accessibility, availability, stability, utilisation and affordability. This is succinctly summarised by Ziervogel (
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), noting that food security is not just about food availability (production, distribution and exchange) but also about access (affordability, allocation and preference) and utilisation (food safety, nutrition and social value). In addition, the World Bank (
