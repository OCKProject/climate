<p class="p">The South African government uses various methods to assess food security. These include General Household Survey (GHS), Income and Expenditure Index (IES), Labour Force Survey (LFS) and Community Survey (Statistics South Africa 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, due to the complexity of measuring food security, these methods yield different results. The FAO (
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) reports that black South Africans constitute the majority of poor and food insecure households, which are largely found in rural areas. Factors such as lack of access to finance, communication infrastructure, education and skill development facilities prevent households from engaging in agricultural farming. In 2008, the World Bank (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) estimated that 39.26% of the total South African population live in rural areas and 65% of them were identified as poor. These statistics suggest that interventions to combat food insecurity in South Africa should largely be directed to rural areas. This is further emphasised by Machete (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) arguing that the South African government needs to give more support to the small-scale farmers to improve agricultural production, particularly at the rural household level.
