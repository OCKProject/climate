<p class="p">The purpose of this article was to examine the impact of climate change on food security in South Africa. This was accentuated by the occurrence of drought that affected the country recently in 2016. From the discussion, food security was found to be a multifaceted concept affected by climate change through food accessibility, availability, accessibility, utilisation and affordability. Agriculture plays a vital role in ensuring food security; it is therefore important to eradicate greenhouse emissions. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> demonstrates that food insecurity is further exacerbated by an increase in population which is greater than the rate of food production, resulting in food shortage. With the lack of rainfall and drought, South Africa is likely to face food insecurity in the future. Another concern is the country’s high levels of unemployment and poverty, which limit many households to access and purchase food. This can further worsen risks of food insecurity. This article therefore suggests that a fight against food insecurity requires not a blanket approach but a multipronged strategy to address other socio-economic challenges such as poverty and unemployment. The article further established that the vulnerability of food security to climate change differs from country to country. Therefore, South Africa’s ability to adapt and protect its food security will depend on the understanding of risks and the vulnerability of various food items to changes in climate. This is important given that South Africa is currently faced with droughts, resulting in the lack of rainfall, rivers drying out, loss of livestock and farmer’s production decreasing very significantly. This article shows how arable land fit for agriculture is becoming scarce through global warming. This calls for a technological intervention, so that agriculture food items can resist the effects of global warming. However, the challenges of adapting to climate changes in most developing countries, including South Africa, are more difficult because such countries have weak institutions and limited access to technology. Another concern is a wide gap between the cost of adapting to climate change and the necessary financial and educational support from the government. There is also a need to invest in technologies that will resist and manage climate risks to food security and also to address the vulnerabilities and weaknesses in food systems.
