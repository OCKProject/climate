 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). The IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) shows that Southern Africa has higher climate change vulnerability and predicts that the consequences could be severe, exerting far-reaching impacts on the livelihoods of many people. According to the IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), agricultural productivity will decline from 21% to 9% by 2080 due to climate change in sub-Saharan Africa. The report indicates that rising temperatures in precipitation are likely to reduce the production of stable food by up to 50%. In Tanzania, Pedram, David and Navin (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) reported that by 2050, the projected increase of 2 Â°C will reduce the average production of maize, sorghum and rice by 13%, 8.8% and 7.6%, respectively. Knueppel, Demment and Kaisser (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) argue that lower levels of education attainment are directly linked with the high food insecurity in Tanzania.
