<p class="p">From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, it can be denoted that since 1965, Carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) emissions have been considerably low and the amount of arable land was high. However, since 2001, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions have been volatile and have increased, and the amount of arable land has decreased significantly. This decrease is caused by an increase in global warming (World Bank 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Drought severity has increased with global warming, degrading available arable land. Many households in rural areas are dependent largely on subsistence farming for survival, and with a decrease in arable land, these households will face a lack of food security.
