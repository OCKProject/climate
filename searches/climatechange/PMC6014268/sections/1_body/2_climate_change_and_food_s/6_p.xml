 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> illustrates that crop production per hectare has historically been volatile, while population growth rate has been relatively constant over the past 20 years. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>, it can be denoted that over the last two decades, the population has, on an average, been growing at a rate higher than that of crop production. The production of crops comprises maize, rice, wheat and soybean. The challenge of food security is exacerbated by an increase in population which is greater than the rate of food production, resulting in an increase in the number of households to feed. In essence, the demand for food exceeds the supply of food, thus leading to food shortage. This is confirmed by the World Bank (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), reporting that global population continues to rise; however, the growth rate between food production and population growth is not equal. The crop production yield per hectare is, on average, increasing at a rate below that of global population.
