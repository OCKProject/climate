<p class="p">A study by Gutu, Bezabih and Mengistu (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) reveals that in Ethiopia, food production faces severe challenges due to climate change, noting that the annual production losses to climate variability significantly increase from year to year. The European Commission (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) report similarly shows that climate change in Africa will reduce crop yields and in turn will increase the price of food that will force people to change production and consumption patterns. Vogel (
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) argues that sub-Saharan Africa is highly vulnerable to food insecurity, pointing out that drought, flooding and pest outbreaks are some of the stressors on food security. Schmidhuber and Tubiello (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) argue that global warming will have significant negative effects on food security, with an estimate of between 5 and 170 million people at risk of hunger by the year 2080. In South Africa, Hendriks (
