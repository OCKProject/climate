 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows that over the past two decades, the population has on average been growing at a rate higher than that of crop yields. From 1996 to 2016, the average growth of crop production is 1.05% and of population is 1.27%. This raises a concern as it implies that food security is seriously challenged, as the population growth is greater than the crop production. This implies that food production will not be able to meet global demand for food, leaving millions of people having reduced food security.
