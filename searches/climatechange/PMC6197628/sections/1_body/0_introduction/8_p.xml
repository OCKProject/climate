<p class="p">The study site is located &gt;10 km inside a protected area (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002675.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). According to the World Database on Protected Areas (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://protectedplanet.net/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://protectedplanet.net/</ext-link>), the Mana Pools National Park, together with its adjoining Sapi and Chewore Safari Areas and the adjacent Hurungwe Safari Area, has a total area of 9,660 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. It has been free of agricultural settlement since 1958, when the people living there were relocated [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Since then, the combined area has been protected against settlement, agriculture, and illegal hunting and logging and was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. In this area, HAT occurs, and tsetse populations have not been exposed to any form of control. In addition, being situated in a protected area, the region has not been subject to other deliberate environmental or sociological change. Analyses by Hansen and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] show that this area experienced &lt;0.5% woodland loss between 2000 and 2010, with the majority of the 30 m Ã— 30 m pixels in the Hansen and colleagues dataset within Mana Pools consisting of at least 10% wooded cover (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002675.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, an aerial survey for elephant and buffalo in 2014 [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] indicated that, in the 200 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> around Rekomitjie, there was an average of 1.6 elephants and 7.3 buffalo per km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Vale and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] showed that c. 2 elephants per km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> can provide about half of the diet of savanna species of tsetse and can support a population of flies even when alternative hosts are heavily depleted.
