<p class="p">Tsetse flies (
 <italic class="italic">Glossina</italic> spp.) transmit protozoa of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Trypanosoma</italic> that cause sleeping sickness—human African trypanosomiasis (HAT)—in humans. The initial phase of HAT is characterised by intermittent fever and joint pains; thereafter, there are sleeping difficulties and confusion. Without treatment, the disease is fatal. Parasites of this genus also cause nagana—animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT)—in livestock.
