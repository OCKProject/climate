<p class="p">Increases in global temperatures since the late 1800s [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] have led to shifts in the ranges of many animals [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Insects in particular are sensitive to changes in temperature, with consequences for the transmission of vector-borne pathogens [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] has affected vector distribution and abundance, could be used to predict future disease risks [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], but existing studies often rely instead on statistical correlations [
