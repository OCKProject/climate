<p class="p">HAT is one of several vector-borne diseases for which detecting human cases is difficult even in countries with relatively strong health systems. In Uganda, for instance, it is estimated that for every reported case of Rhodesian HAT, another 12 go undetected [

In remote parts of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Central African Republic, and South Sudan, finding cases is even more difficult. In these circumstances, prospects for gathering data to detect or predict the impact of climate change on HAT seem poor. Models to predict where vectors are abundant, supported by xenomonitoring of tsetse populations for pathogenic trypanosomes [
