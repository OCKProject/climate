<p class="p">In any region where the climate becomes more suitable for tsetse, there must, however, be adequate vegetation cover to provide shelter for the flies. The clearing of land for agricultural development, which is occurring at an accelerating pace in many parts of Africa [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], will reduce the vegetation cover and the densities of wild hosts in what has been termed the autonomous control of tsetse [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Any future predictions of the effects of climate change on tsetse populations and/or trypanosomiasis should consider these other confounding effects, as has been done for malaria [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. Gething and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] demonstrated that any future predicted changes in malaria due to climate would likely be magnitudes smaller than changes due to control and other anthropogenic factors.
