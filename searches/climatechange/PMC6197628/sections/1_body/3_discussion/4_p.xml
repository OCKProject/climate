<p class="p">There are several biologically feasible reasons to expect increased tsetse mortality at high temperatures. Tsetse are poikilotherms, and their metabolic rate increases with temperature: adult tsetse therefore utilise their blood meal more rapidly at elevated temperature and must feed more frequently. But feeding is a high-risk activity, and increased feeding rates will likely result in increased mortality [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This behaviour reduces their metabolic rate but also reduces their chances of feeding. Hence or otherwise female tsetse have reduced fat levels and produce progressively smaller pupae as temperatures increase [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. This has a knock-on effect on pupal mortality because smaller pupae can suffer very high mortality at elevated temperatures [
