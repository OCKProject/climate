<p class="p">Most (&gt;95%) cases of HAT occur in Central and West Africa, where the important vectors are subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">palpalis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fuscipes</italic>, which are riverine tsetse. These species have very similar physiology to the savanna species of East and Southern Africa, including 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pallidipes</italic>, and hence we would expect that populations of riverine tsetse would decline if they were exposed to the temperature increases reported in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe.
