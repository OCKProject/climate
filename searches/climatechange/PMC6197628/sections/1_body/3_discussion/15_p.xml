<p class="p">A limitation of our study is that the estimated confidence intervals for model-fitted parameters, such as those for adult mortality, are underestimates, in part because they incorporate only the uncertainty resulting from fitting the model with fixed values for other parameters and do not incorporate uncertainty in those fixed parameters. Another limitation is that we did not have sufficient data to test the predictive power of our fitted model.</p>
