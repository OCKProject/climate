<p class="p">Over the past decade, c. 90% of all reported cases of Gambian HAT occurred in the DRC [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. For the tsetse-infested regions of the DRC where HAT occurs (e.g., Provinces of Mai Ndombe, Kwilu, and Kasai), there are no data to suggest that climate change has had an impact on tsetse and HAT. For HAT foci in West Africa, however, there is some evidence that climate change has had an impact. First, Courtin and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] describe a 100 km shift southwards in the northern limit of tsetse that they attribute to drought, rising temperatures, and increased human density. Regions where tsetse appear to be absent include areas in which sleeping sickness occurred in the 1930s. Second, Courtin and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] report that, across West Africa, the more northerly foci of HAT located in Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger have ceased to be active. The authors attribute this change to increased densities of humans, anthropogenic destruction of tsetse habitat, and climate change. Medical surveys conducted between 2000 and 2006 did not detect any cases of HAT north of the 1,200 mm isohyet, and comparison of the 1,200 mm isohyet for the periods 1951–1969 and 1970–1989 show that it had shifted south.
