They had access to a wide range of measures of meteorological variables but found that once temperature had been included in their model, the addition of any further candidate variables—including rainfall, humidity, saturation deficit, and cloud cover—did not result in any improvement in the fit to the data. At Rekomitjie, over the whole study period, we had data only on temperature and rainfall. Nonetheless, the Antelope Island study suggests that we were unlikely to be missing other important climatological variables.
