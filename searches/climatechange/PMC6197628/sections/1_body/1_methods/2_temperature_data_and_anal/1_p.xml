<p class="p">Daily records of rainfall and minimum and maximum temperature have been kept at Rekomitjie since 1959. Staff at Rekomitjie, operating in accord with directions from the Zimbabwe Department of Meteorological Services, made recordings at 7:00 AM each day from maximum and minimum mercury thermometers housed in a Stevenson screen. The location of the screen is at 16° 10′S 29° 25′E, altitude 503 m. To quantify changes in the mean temperature over time, we first calculated mean monthly temperatures between October 1959 and June 2017. Then, using a reference period between January 1960 and December 1989, we calculated monthly temperature anomalies by subtracting the reference mean from the actual mean. We smoothed the temperature anomaly data using a 5-year running mean, as done for previous analyses of regional and global changes in temperature [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]—a wrapper for fitting linear models allowing for a trend variable. We subsequently employed the fitted trend to estimate the change in monthly temperature, from the peak in 1975 to the peak in 2017, and the 95% prediction intervals, using the forecast function in R [
