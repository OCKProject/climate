<p class="p">As a preliminary to the data fitting procedure, the model was run for 5 years prior to the start of the first month of available temperature data in October 1959 using the average monthly temperatures from October 1960 to September 1961 because we did not know initial starting values for numbers of pupae, relative to the numbers of fed female adults caught. The initial number of parous adults and pupae at time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0 was set to 100 and the number of nulliparous adults to 25, and the model was solved at monthly time steps for comparison with values from the bioassay catch data. We fitted the model to the data using maximum likelihood, assuming the data were Poisson distributed. For 80% of months, the variance to mean ratio for the daily catch data was less than 1.5, and was between 1.5 and 4.0 for 20%, indicating that, in most circumstances, the variance was approximately equal to the mean. For each set of parameters, we first estimated parameter values using the stochastic simulated annealing algorithm [
