 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], to a single larva, which immediately burrows into the ground and pupates, emerging 30 to 50 days later as a full-sized adult [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. As quantified by researchers in the laboratory and field, larviposition and pupal emergence rates are dependent on temperature, as are the mortality rates of both pupae and adults [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pmed.1002675.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Preliminary analyses suggested that the inclusion of temperature-dependent mortality rates was sufficient to model the observed decline. In response to suggestions from peer reviewers, we also reanalysed the data using models that included functions for temperature-dependent larviposition and pupal emergence rates.
