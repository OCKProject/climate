    <p class="p">Tsetse flies are blood-feeding insects that transmit pathogens causing fatal diseases of humans and livestock across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

    <p class="p">The birth and death rates of tsetse are influenced by environmental conditions, particularly temperature.</p>

    <p class="p">Since 1975, mean daily temperatures at Rekomitjie, a research station in the Zambezi Valley of Zimbabwe, have risen by c. 0.9°C and temperatures in the hottest month of November by c. 2°C. These increases in temperature may have impacted tsetse populations and the diseases they transmit.</p>

    <p class="p">Since the 1960s, wild tsetse have been caught regularly from cattle for insecticide tests conducted at Rekomitjie.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">Prior to 1990, catches were on average &gt;50 flies per animal per afternoon; however, in 2017, teams frequently failed to catch a single fly.</p>

    <p class="p">A mathematical model of tsetse population change, which included temperature-dependent rates for births and deaths, suggests that the decline in tsetse is related to rising temperatures.</p>

    <p class="p">Our findings provide a first step in linking the effects of increasing temperatures to the distribution of diseases caused by tsetse.</p>
   </list-item>
   <list-item class="list-item">
    <p class="p">If the effect extends across the Zambezi Valley, then tsetse-borne disease is likely to have been reduced across the region. Conversely, rising temperatures may have made some higher, cooler areas more suitable, leading to the emergence of new disease foci.</p>
