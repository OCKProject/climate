<p class="p">Our data compilation consists of directly quoted temperature changes representative of the most significant changes in the studied records (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, see Methods. Full data listing in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The data underline the near-unprecedented rapidity of recent, directly observed temperature change. Geological rates from individual, localized records only rarely exceeded globally integrated (land and ocean) rates of change determined over the last 150 years
