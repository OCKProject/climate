<p class="p">To further assess the robustness of the observed scaling we conducted a Monte Carlo analysis to investigate the effects of uncertainty in the compilation data (see Methods). The key sources of uncertainty are calibration and analytical errors of the proxies, and dating inaccuracies. We generated 10,000 versions of the compilation with randomly applied magnitude errors of ±4 °C (2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) and timespan errors of ±50% (2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>). These errors likely exceed the true uncertainty in the magnitude and timespan estimates of the compilation, and hence permit a conservative appraisal of the robustness of the scaling (see Methods). Correlation analysis indicates that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values for the relationship between timespan and magnitude are &lt;0.01 in over 99.9% of simulations of the combined ocean and continental data, with the mean slope 0.09±0.03 (2
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>). The mean slope defining the scaling between timespan and rate in our simulations is −0.91±0.03 (see also Methods). Therefore, reasonable uncertainties in both proxies and timespans are unlikely to affect the scaling relationship we observe.
