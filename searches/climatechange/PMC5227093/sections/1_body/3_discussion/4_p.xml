<p class="p">Taken together, our observations support the inferences that: (1) the data in our compilation are representative of the low to mid-latitude climate system at large; (2) maximum magnitudes/rates of change in our compilation are broadly representative of the attainable limits of this system; and (3) the data and observed scaling are not influenced significantly by biases resulting from compiling data from multiple proxies, locations, ages, background climate states and depositional environments.</p>
