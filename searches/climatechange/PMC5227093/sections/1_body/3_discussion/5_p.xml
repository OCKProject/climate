<p class="p">Analysis and discussion of geological and recent climate variability has hitherto failed to acknowledge timespan-dependent scaling as a first order control on the observable magnitude and rate of climate change. This has consequences for accurately assessing the impacts of climate change on life. For example, the niche evolution of vertebrates, inferred from ancestorâ€“descendant comparisons over millions of years, has been contrasted with projected rates of climate change in this century to conclude that the rate of warming exceeds the adaptive potential of animals by orders of magnitude
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. Our work indicates instead that geological episodes of climatic or evolutionary change likely fail to capture the true pace of changes on timescales of most relevance for understanding the impact of similar changes today. Implicitly, our findings also mean that caution must be exercised when describing recent temperature changes as unprecedented in the context of geological rates. If rates of change are to be meaningfully interpreted, then the measurement timespan must be explicitly specified.
