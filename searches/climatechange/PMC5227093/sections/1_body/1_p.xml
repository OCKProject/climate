<p class="p">Determining the pace and magnitude of ancient climate change is reliant on the accuracy and validity of palaeotemperature proxies, the accuracy of dating methods and the fidelity of the stratigraphic record for recording climate

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. These considerations temper the ability to compare directly ancient and modern rates of change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Nevertheless, the clearest disparity between recent and geological assessments of climate change is the attainable temporal resolution at which changes can be identified and rates determined. A compilation of 194 published oceanic and continental temperature changes spanning the Ordovician period (476â€‰Myr ago) to the present provides a holistic picture of the attainable magnitude and rate of both warming and cooling episodes through Earth history across a range of measurement timespans. We demonstrate that magnitudes and rates of geological temperature changes in this compilation exhibit power law scaling with timespan, emphasising how geological data alias short-term climate variability. Consequently, the true attainable pace of ancient climate change may be commonly underestimated, compromising our understanding of the relative pace (and severity) of both ancient and recent climate change.
