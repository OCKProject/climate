<p class="p">Our compilation comprises 194 temperature changes and associated timespans taken from 93 publications in the peer reviewed scientific literature (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref> for full data set). These changes are quoted in the text of the published works, with timespan data either also quoted or derived from figures or additional references (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Data 1</xref>). The data in the compilation are assumed to be representative of the most relevant climatic changes in a given record and of sufficient significance to the scope of the published work to be worthy of quoting. The temperature changes that our compilation provides are not necessarily representative of global changes. Rather, the data are representative of local palaeoclimatic records, which serve as the only empirical archive of Earth's climatic evolution. SST data dominate the literature and the compilation (132 data points). We did not include polar temperature records owing to the demonstrable higher magnitudes of polar atmospheric temperature change

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Nine data points are of recent temperature changes that have been directly observed over the last &lt;150 years, and are global averages.
