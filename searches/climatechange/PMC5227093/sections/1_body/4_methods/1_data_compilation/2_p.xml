<p class="p">Inescapable biases in our compilation include an age-dependence on timespan, because timespans cannot exceed twice the median age of a succession. Equally, timespan is dependent on dating method. Milankovitch dating offers the highest resolving power in records lacking radiocarbon control (that is, any record older than ∼50 kyr) but is likely incapable of providing precision of &lt;1,000 years

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>). The broad match between the scaling of maximum SST changes in our compilation and the ensembled pattern of SST changes of the past ∼13 Myr (which have age models based primarily on Milankovitch dating) suggest that any biases related to age or dating control do not affect the veracity of our inferences, which is also supported by our Monte Carlo error analysis.
