<p class="p">To extract timespan-dependent temperature changes from the ensemble and polar temperature data presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, each temperature value in each individual record was subtracted from every other value in the record to define magnitudes. The published age for each value in the records provided timespan information. The routine worked forwards in time (that is, starting with the oldest value) to define trends (warming or cooling) and avoid duplication. To define maximum attained magnitudes of temperature changes (that is, black and grey lines and red dashed lines in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the magnitude data were binned in 0.5 log bins with the largest value in each bin defining the maximum magnitude for that timespan range.
