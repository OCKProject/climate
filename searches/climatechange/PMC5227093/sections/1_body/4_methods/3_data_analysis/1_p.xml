<p class="p">Scaling statistics (slopes) were conducted using least squares regression of log-transformed data. Standard error of the slopes in the raw data were calculated using a bootstrap approach (random sampling with replacement) with 10,000 iterations. Hypothesis testing was based on non-parametric correlation tests (Spearman's

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> values represent the probability of correlation coefficients at least as high as calculated arising by chance if no correlation existed. As outlined in the main text, our statistical analyses specifically tested the scaling of magnitude with timespan owing to the spurious correlation that arises when investigating the relationship between timespan and rate
