  <p class="p">Timespan-dependence of sea surface temperature (SST) change is plotted along with maximum magnitudes (heavy black line, see Methods), not including the extreme values of the Permian–Triassic boundary event (orange points). The coloured cluster density plot shows the distribution of &gt;1.6 million temperature changes calculated from an ensemble of 27 single-site SST records, binned into 0.5 × 0.05 log bins (see Methods and

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>) temperature records (red dashed lines).
