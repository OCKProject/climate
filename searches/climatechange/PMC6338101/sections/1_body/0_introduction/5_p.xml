<p class="p">The principal research questions addressed by this study were: (a) Do the growth responses of populations transferred to different climates differ between tree species? (b) If they do, is part of the differential response embedded in the genetic variation among the source populations? (c) If such differential responses to climate exist between species and populations, do they contribute to the observed variation in growth decline, mortality or local extinction as a result of climate change (
