<p class="p">Analyses of quaternary and recent range shifts have indicated that tree species migrate at different rates, due to differences in their migration abilities and successional behavior, but probably also due to differences in their sensitivity to climate change; these differences in migration rate may have affected the composition of forest communities (e.g.,Â

An understanding of the determinants of the response of forest trees to changing environmental conditions is of fundamental importance, as the stability and productivity of forest cover plays a vital role in mitigating the negative effects of climate change.
