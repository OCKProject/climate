<p class="p">The maxima of the response functions were displaced towards cooler/moister climate conditions, deviating from the expected maximum productivity in the climate of provenance, for all species except beech. This finding was interpreted to reflect an adaptation lag and probably indicates that processes of local adaptation include other genetic effects and phenotypic plasticity, in addition to selection, preventing “genetically perfect” optimization.</p>
