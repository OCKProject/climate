<p class="p">The steeper genetic differentiation clines in populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> probably contribute to their sharper response to climate, as demonstrated by their transfer functions. By contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> had shallower genetic clines, probably accounting for their flatter climate response curves.
