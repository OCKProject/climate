<p class="p">The analysis of responses to climatic transfer showed that the height growth response was determined primarily by the extent of change (i.e., by the ecodistance of climate transfer), whereas climate conditions at provenance, the site to which the populations were originally adapted, played a more limited role. This study is original in its demonstration of response functions of different shapes in the four species studied. The two broadleaved species had wide flat response curves, whereas the two conifers had steep and narrow curves of response to changes in climatic factors. This differential response can be interpreted as evidence for differences in climate sensitivity between the two pairs of species.</p>
