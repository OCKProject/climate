 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horváth &amp; Mátyás (2016)</xref>. For the provenance climate, the earliest available climate data were used, to characterize the conditions to which populations had adapted in the past, through a long process of evolution. Climate data for 1961–1990 were used for the normalized climate period immediately before seed collection for 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>. These reference periods are the best estimates of the conditions responsible for the semblance of adaptive equilibrium before human-induced climate change began to accentuate (

 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>, for which seeds were selected earlier than for the broadleaved species, we used the mean climate data estimates for the 1941–1970 period. The climate data estimates for the test sites were calculated as the mean values for the period from planting to measurement, as in
