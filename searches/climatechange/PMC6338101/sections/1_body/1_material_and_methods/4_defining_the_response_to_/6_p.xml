<p class="p">We used a screening procedure to select climate variables for the linear and quadratic functions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-10" class="xref">Appendix S2</xref>). We found a single provenance climate variable appropriately expressing the clinal variation between populations. The inclusion of additional variables reduced the statistical quality of the models. In theory, multivariate climate transfer effects are intuitively appealing, but they increase statistical complexity and may lead to insurmountable constraints.
