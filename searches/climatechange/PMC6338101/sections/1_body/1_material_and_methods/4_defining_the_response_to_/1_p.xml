<p class="p">We checked the consistency of the results, using tree height as the dependent variable. We then used tree height and annual tree height increment as dependent variables, for modeling of the plant response to climate at species level, analyzing genetic differences between populations nested within species, with the approach described by

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leites et al. (2012b)</xref>. The mixed effects model (SAS/STAT computer software, release 9.1; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) includes both fixed and random effects. The fixed effects in this context correspond to genetic differences between populations due to climatic conditions, and can be split into three major components (
