<p class="p">The climatic niches of different species are obviously not defined by the same climatic variables, as individual climatic variables can have different impacts on growth in different species. A compromise was therefore required to achieve an instructive comparison of response functions between the four forest tree species. For this purpose, we developed a common model, including the same climatic variables, for all four species. This may appear counterintuitive, but it should be borne in mind that the ecological tolerance range of a species is generally characterized with a single climate factor, even though the effect of this factor has different weights at the trailing (xeric) and front (thermal) limits of the distribution. We adopted a two-step approach to select the best climatic variables. We first explored the overall fit to a global model including the species and population components, by screening a large number of climatic variables. Once the most decisive climatic variables had been identified, we then performed a separate analysis for each species, to retrieve the species reaction norms, which we then compared.</p>
