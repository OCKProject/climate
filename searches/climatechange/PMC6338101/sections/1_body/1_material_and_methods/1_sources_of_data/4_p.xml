<p class="p">The positions of the sampled populations and trial sites in the climatic space are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>, and the climate ranges covered by the provenances represented in the field tests and of the test sites relative to the species climate range are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Figs. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">2C</xref>. The four species have very different geographic distributions, but the sampled ranges overlap at least partially and sufficiently for comparison. The test sites were in average slightly warmer than the sites of origin of the populations tested. At the time at which the tests were established, well before climate change became a major concern, it was usual to establish such experiments in favorable site conditions. The shift in climate conditions already underway at the time may have contributed to this. (Note that the reference climate periods for provenance locations and test sites are differentâ€”see below.) The locations of the provenance and field test sites for 
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris</italic> cover a much smaller interval than the species as a whole, due to the relatively limited size of the range selected for investigation relative to the immense natural distribution of this species.
