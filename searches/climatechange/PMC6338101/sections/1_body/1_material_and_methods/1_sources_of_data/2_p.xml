<p class="p">Both the test sites and populations selected for the comparison were highly diverse. Layouts and test ages were not uniform, because the initial experiments had different individual goals and constraints concerning seed procurement and the planting of material due to seed crop fluctuations and differences in site accessibility. Randomized complete block designs were used for all four species, with blocks and replicated plots (for
