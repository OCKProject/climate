<p class="p">In the framework of the European Union joint project FORGER (#289119), the response functions (reaction norms) of these four model species were investigated in European provenance tests by the Hungarian and French authors of this study. Part of the dataset from these multiple field provenance tests was used for this analysis. Fourteen populations of Scots pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris)</italic> were selected from four trials performed by the VNIILM Institute, Pushkino, Russia (

 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shutyaev &amp; Giertych, 2000</xref>); 34 populations were chosen from five trials of the international Norway spruce (

 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horváth &amp; Mátyás, 2016</xref>) and 14 populations of sessile oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea)</italic> from 23 trials of the “Madsen collection” were used (
