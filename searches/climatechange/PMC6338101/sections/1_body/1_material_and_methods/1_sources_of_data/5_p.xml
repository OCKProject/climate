<p class="p">For the statistical analysis, we used means per population per block, except for the 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> trial network, which was established as a single-tree plot system with 25 replicate, for which means per site and per population were used. For technical reasons, our dataset was not balanced across species, as different numbers of populations and field sites per species were included in the analysis.
