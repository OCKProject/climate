<p class="p">We explored the amount of genetic differentiation between populations, probably linked to the shape of the response function, by investigating the expression of clines along environmental gradients, by screening relevant provenance climate variables. We estimated Spearman’s correlation coefficients for the relationship between the mean ATHI per population per site and the provenance climate variables. We analyzed only “good sites” (sites at which the mean per population per site was above the overall mean), as differences in growth potential between populations are best expressed in mild environmental conditions. We ranked the absolute values of Spearman’s correlation coefficient by species. We then selected the three climate variables with the highest Spearman correlation coefficient values for each species. The site effect was eliminated by estimating the best linear unbiased parameter (BLUP) value for each site, and subtracting it from the provenance mean per site. BLUPs were estimated with a reduced mixed model, in which climate at provenance was a fixed effect and site was a random effect. The next step was to standardize the described corrected mean per population per site, by dividing it by the overall mean (across provenances and sites). In other words, we obtained standardized corrected means for each population and site, with a distribution centered on zero. Finally, we performed a linear regression analysis of the standardized corrected means per population per site against the provenance climate values of the three most relevant climatic variables per species identified in previous analyses, to compare the fit and slope of the regression lines. We plotted the regressions, to obtain a visual comparison of the different cline patterns between species.</p>
