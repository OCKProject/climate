<p class="p">We then refitted the model for each species separately, with the same selected variables, but using only observed data for the species concerned as input, to generate appropriate parameter values for the fixed-effect terms, and individual response functions for each species. These response functions were illustrated by plotting a curve for each species, using the model parameters estimated for the fixed terms for each species, and plotting the mean value of the selected climate variable for the species at the seed source against the best climatic transfer distance variable. The range of climatic transfer distance values (
