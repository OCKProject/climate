<p class="p">We first fitted an “overall” transfer function model, with all four species, and populations nested within species (model 1), to identify the best mixed model with common climatic variables (one for provenance, one for climatic transfer distance). The best variable combination for the response functions (reaction norms) was determined simultaneously for the four species. We compared 49 models, and the one with the lowest AIC (Akaike Information Criterion, 
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akaike, 1973</xref>) value was selected as the best model. Model selection, including preselection of the seven best models for provenance and the seven best models for climatic transfer distance, yielding a matrix of 49 competing models, is described in
