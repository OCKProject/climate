<p class="p">We checked that the differences in response curve between species persisted even if a different set of climate variables was used, by fitting response curves independently for each species. In this validation process, we selected the best climatic variable for each species separately with model 2. We thus obtained four pairs of climatic variables (for the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> terms for each species). We then used each pair of variables obtained for a given species on the other three species, implementing model 2. This procedure yielded 16 models in total.
