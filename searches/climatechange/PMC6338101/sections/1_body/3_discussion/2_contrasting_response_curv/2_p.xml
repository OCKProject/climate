<p class="p">The flatter climatic response curves of 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> (resulting in modest growth over a wider range of aridity indices than for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>) indicates that the populations of these species have higher levels of plasticity, enabling them to adapt to a broader range of environments. The response curves of these species were also flat towards the cooler and more humid environments. By contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> have steeper response curves with more pronounced slopes, encompassing a narrower range of environmental conditions to which they appear to be adapted. These response curves suggest that spruce and pine are more vulnerable to climate change, as the pronounced cline slopes indicate a higher degree of specialization. In a context of assisted migration, the conifer response curves suggest a large advantage of re-aligning genotypes to the environment to which they are adapted. Transferring seed sources to sites at which the future climate is predicted to be similar to their current “home” climate is being treated as a possible option in operational forestry.
