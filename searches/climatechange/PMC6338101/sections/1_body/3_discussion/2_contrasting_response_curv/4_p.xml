<p class="p">The lower adaptability of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> to climatic transfer distance may result from their pronounced differentiation into genetic clines along climatic gradients, due to the divergent selection that has historically occurred along these gradients. In other words, steeper genetic clines probably constrain the response of pine and spruce populations to narrower reaction norms. By contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> have milder clines, which contribute to flatter reaction norms. We suspect that the widths of the climatic gradients to which populations were exposed were relatively similar for the four species, as they occupy similar geographic ranges, at least in Central Europe. Differences in cline steepness between species are therefore likely to reflect intrinsic genetic differences between species.
