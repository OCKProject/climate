<p class="p">It is tempting to conclude that the more plastic responses of 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> might be due to the shedding of their leaves in the fall, or in periods of severe drought, enabling them to escape the worst climatic stresses, but this is probably an oversimplification. Evolutionary genetic and ecophysiological background, and, thus, adaptive strategy, appear to differ between species, making simple generalizations difficult. Even within closely related species, such as those of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Abies</italic>, the between-species differences in plasticity measured in common gardens are considerable (

The plasticity of adaptive specialists, with a high between-population variance for adaptive traits, may result in higher levels of sensitivity to climatic conditions, as in Norway spruce. By contrast, in beech, which had a flat response curve to climate changes in our analysis, high levels of within-population genetic variation were detected in comparison tests on seedlings (
