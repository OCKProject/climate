<p class="p">Another constraint inherent to the comparative approach relates to that the choice of model. We assumed a quadratic response for each species, based on the generally accepted ecological assumption that the response of populations to changes in environmental factors follows a symmetric “bell-shaped” curve (e.g.,

The quadratic response model has proved successful for explaining variation in boreal conifers, but appears to be less effective for other species, including broadleaved species in particular, which display greater phenotypic plasticity in their response to site attributes, including climate.
