<p class="p">The calculated parameter statistics for the mixed model confirm that the species-specific growth responses of populations are confounded with tree age, and partially with local site conditions. The largest variance component was the species effect (63.0% of random effects, see 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), but this value explains above all differences in age and site potential. The contribution of the exclusively genetic between-population component appears to be modest (3.3%, 
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). It should be stressed that this figure accounts for only a part of the genetic variation captured by the analysis. Three fixed components (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>; related to climate as a selective force), and the random component (resulting from effects other than climate) also contribute to genetic variation within species, and the transfer distance explains provenance-by-environment interactions.
