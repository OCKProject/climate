<p class="p">Finally, the climatic range encompassed by the sampled populations and test sites for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and by the test sites for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> (particularly for rainfall for 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>), being smaller than covered by the natural distributions of these species, may have limited our capacity to model the response function for the species as a whole with sufficient robustness. However, even with this limitation, we were able to capture the pattern of genetic differentiation between populations, with the detection of very pronounced clines for 
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris,</italic> as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>.
