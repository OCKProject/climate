<p class="p">The unbalanced, heterogeneous experimental setting may also have affected the outcome of this study. For researchers not familiar with field data from continent-wide common garden test series, the low level of model fitting across species may appear too uncertain for any practical conclusions to be drawn. A number of uncontrollable factors may have biased the response of individual species relative to others. In addition to management practices, important interacting biotic factors (e.g., differential pest pressures), and variations of local site conditions (fertility and water-holding capacity of the soil, hydrology) may be confounded with climatic effects. The consideration of site potential, as understood in forestry (an inseparable complex of soil, water and climate factors) might have accounted for much of the remaining variation. Insufficient detail in the description of experimental sites contributed to the high level of unexplained variation. In an international experimental series, in which data retrieval is dependent on different providers in different countries, it can be very challenging to obtain meaningful site data (exposure, soil type, rainfall, microclimate etc.) because of missing data for standard descriptors. Even the assessment of the most important abiotic factor in this analysis, climate, is dependent on the use of statistical concepts to interpolate digital surfaces from data points corresponding to meteorological observations. This situation, which is typical for large-scale common garden tests, highlights the need to describe site characteristics more accurately, to increase the predictive power of these valuable and often unique experiments.</p>
