<p class="p">We acknowledge that our conclusions regarding the contrasting responses of species may be driven by constraints inherent to the comparative approach used. The selection of a single “universal” climate variable, such as ADI (annual dryness index) seems, intuitively, to hinder the combined analysis of four species with different ecological niches. This approach undoubtedly increased the proportion of the variance remaining unexplained and lowered the significance of the results. However, given the continent-wide shift in climatic conditions at all sites, all tree species are simultaneously confronted with a real threat to their vitality and a risk of mortality across the distribution area: extreme droughts (

ADI transfer difference (ADI_d) expresses the balance between temperature (degree days above 5 °C) and water availability, and, indirectly, the probability, intensity and frequency of extreme events regardless of geographic location. Through the use of differential values (transfer distances), we were able to take the
