<p class="p">Our results indicate that the studied species (except for the adaptive generalist species beech, for which results were inconclusive) are preferentially present in environments that are drier or warmer than their optimum for growth. “Non-optimality” is a specific phenomenon of deviation from the expected symmetric shape of response curves. Asymmetric responses have been detected in common garden datasets (

 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mátyás, 1990</xref>) indicated that response functions (reaction norms) constructed from common garden growth data displayed a systematic divergence of maxima from the mimicked position of climate similar to that of the provenance. This lag effect probably indicates a balance in the processes leading to local adaptation between directed selection and other random genetic effects, such as gene flow (see
