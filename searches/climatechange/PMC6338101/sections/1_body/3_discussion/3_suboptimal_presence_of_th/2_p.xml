<p class="p">We further extended “non optimality” towards drier and warmer sites, by analyzing responses to unilateral transfer. We thus focused on the most important practical question in forestry today: how the growth of populations is affected by a simulated shift in climate towards warmer/drier conditions. The simple linear regressions applied are free from extrapolation bias and confirmed the rapid loss of productivity under the anticipated changes in climatic conditions, but this trend has already been reported in species-specific analyses of common garden tests (
