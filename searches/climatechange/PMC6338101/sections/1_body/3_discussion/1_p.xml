<p class="p">Three major results emerge from this comparative analysis of species responses to climate change. First, the response patterns of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> clearly contrast with those of 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic> (e.g., the response curve of 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> encompasses about half the climatic transfer distance range covered by that of 
 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea</italic>, as explained for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Second, these contrasting patterns (
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. abies</italic> having more pronounced slopes than 
 <italic class="italic">F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea</italic>) coincide with the different genetic clines along climatic gradients established historically as a result of divergent selection across the speciesâ€™ distributions, as illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>. Finally, populations of all four species tend to occupy suboptimal, stressful environments, i.e., they are present in climatic niches that are drier or warmer than the optimum for their growth.
