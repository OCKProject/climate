<p class="p">The linear regression of annual aridity index transfer distance (independent variable) against mean scaled tree height per population (response variable) clearly showed, for 
 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea,</italic> that growth decreases following transfer to warmer/drier sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). The regression was highly significant for 
 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt;0.001), and non-significant for 
 <italic class="italic">P.Â abies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica,</italic> with 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> having an intermediate 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value (0.070)
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> with growth tending to decrease with increasing climatic transfer distance towards warmer/drier sites. In this analysis, response functions were not extrapolated beyond the measured points, and data for negative transfer distance values were not considered. The high degree of scatter is largely due to the high within-species variance of individual populations.
