<p class="p">We also modeled the annual tree height increment (ATHI) response (by three-step model selection, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-10" class="xref">Appendix S2</xref>, as for tree height) against annual dryness index, which was identified as the best variable to represent climatic transfer distance and temperature difference (TD = MTWM âˆ’ MTCM = continentality), which was selected as the best variable to represent seed source climate. The results displayed in the supplementary information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-8" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-6" class="xref">Table S6</xref>) reveal a trend similar to that for tree height (
