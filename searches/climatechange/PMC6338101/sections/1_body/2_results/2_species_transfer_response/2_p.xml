<p class="p">The response functions (reaction norms) did not have maxima close to a transfer distance of zero (i.e., corresponding to climates identical to the climate of provenance) for any species other than 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic>, for which the maximum was very close to zero (on the mean curve for this species, the maximum tree height of 196.6 cm corresponds to an annual aridity index transfer distance value of 0.01; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). For 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus petraea</italic>, the maximum height was slightly displaced towards cooler and/or moister sites (for the mean curve of these two species, maximum tree height was predicted to occur at an annual aridity index transfer distance value of −0.02 and −0.04, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). A similar phenomenon was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> (maximum tree height at an annual aridity index transfer distance value of −0.045; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). These results are consistent with the species-specific results of analyses of field tests (e.g., 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mátyás, Nagy &amp; Újvári-Jármay, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rehfeldt et al., 2017</xref>).
