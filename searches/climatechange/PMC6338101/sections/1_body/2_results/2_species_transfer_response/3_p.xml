 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. abies</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">Q. petraea</italic> has a flat response, encompassing a larger climatic interval under the response surface (a range of 0.41 for annual aridity index transfer distance, from about −0.23 to 0.18), whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> has a much steeper and narrower surface, encompassing a smaller climatic space interval (a range of 0.20 for annual aridity index transfer distance, from about −0.11 to 0.09;
