<p class="p">As in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, the predictions shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> are based on the climatic variables selected for simultaneous fitting to all four species, with subsequent refitting of the model for each species, for the estimation of regression coefficients for each species, with scaled heights (only two of the four species are displayed for the sake of clarity). The quadratic 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> term and the linear term 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> determine the shape of the response curve. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> covers the climatic gradient along which population samples were collected, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> describes the response to climatic transfer distance.
