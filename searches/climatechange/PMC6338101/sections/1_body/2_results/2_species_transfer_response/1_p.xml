<p class="p">The trend shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> was confirmed by the fitting of separate response curves for each species, with the three-step model selection procedure repeated for each species. The shapes of the curves obtained were generally similar to those in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, except that the quadratic term yielded a positive value in some cases, resulting in an inverted, biologically unacceptable curve, which was therefore discarded. Curves of this type fitted for 
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-7" class="xref">Fig. S1B</xref>) are presented in the supplementary information.
