<p class="p">Specific values for the two common variables selected (corresponding to terms 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>) were used for each species as well, to build a model with estimated parameters of the fixed-effect terms for each species. The quadratic response functions are shown for the species in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. Curve height is related to the age of the populations at the time of measurement (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). The curves for the two conifers are therefore higher than those for the broadleaved trees because the trials were older. Thus, when comparing the curves, width and steepness should be considered, rather than maxima.
