<p class="p">After preselecting the climatic variables and identifying the overall (full) model best explaining the variability (for all four species), we applied a transfer distance based on annual dryness index (ADI) as the 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> term of the mixed model and used winter mean maximum temperature (Â°C) of the climate at provenance as the 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic> term of the mixed model. The statistics of the model with the selected variables are presented in 
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. Details of model selection and a comparison of fits with models based on other climatic variables can be found in
