  <title class="title">Predicted tree height for the four species based on the best fitted model for (a) 
   <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> and for (b) 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris.</italic>
  </title>
  <p class="p">For F. sylvatica, the two selected climatic variables were: annual dryness index as transfer distance (D term of the mixed model), and summer mean minimum temperature as climate of the seed source (C term of the mixed model). For P. sylvestris, the two selected climatic variables were: annual dryness index as transfer distance (D term of the mixed model), and autumn (Sep. - Nov.) mean temperature (Â°C) as climate of the seed source (C term of the mixed model). After fitting the model for each of the two previous species, in each case the model then was refitted for the other three species and their respective fixed effect parameters used for estimate the climatic response function. Larger positive values on the x axis indicate transfer to drier sites and/or warmer sites; negative values indicate transfer to colder and/or wetter sites; a value of zero indicates transfer to a test site with a climate similar to that of the site of provenance. For illustrative purposes on this plots, we selected extreme populations for each specie along the environmental gradient.</p>
