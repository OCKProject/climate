  <title class="title">Selection of climatic variables and best overall model for tree height</title>
  <p class="p">Preselected best seven transfer distance climatic variables for tree height (Step 1). Selection was based on the AIC and the significance (
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>) of the transfer distance climatic quadratic term. Preselected seed source climatic variables (Step 2). Selection was based on Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (
   <italic class="italic">r</italic>), between population means across sites and the seed source climatic variable. The best full model (Step 3) were selected on the basis of AIC value (after fitting the model with individual values). In each step, models are sorted by their AIC or absolute Spearman’s 
   <italic class="italic">r</italic> value.
