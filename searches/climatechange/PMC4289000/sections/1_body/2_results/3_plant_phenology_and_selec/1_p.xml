<p class="p">Among-individual differences in plant resistance to oviposition were related to phenology and size, but relationships differed among species and among regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>; Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7 in Electronic Supplementary Material). Plants in more advance phenological stages were significantly more attacked in 
 <italic class="italic">A. thaliana</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T. caerulescens</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. pratensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">A. hirsuta</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">A. glabra</italic>, while the opposite was true in 
 <italic class="italic">C. paludosa</italic>. However, the effects of phenology significantly differed among regions for several species (significant effects of region × phenology in two species and of region × size × phenology in two additional species, Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7). In 
 <italic class="italic">T. caerulescens</italic>, late-flowering individuals were more attacked in the north, but there was no significant effect of phenology in the central region. In 
 <italic class="italic">C. pratensis</italic>, late-flowering individuals were more attacked in the south region but there was no effect of phenology in the other regions. On average, butterflies preferred larger plants in all host species except for 
 <italic class="italic">T. caerulescens</italic> (Fig. 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7). However, in five of seven species, the effects of size differed along the latitudinal gradient (significant effects of region × size or region × size × phenology in Table 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7). There were also significant effects of the interaction size × phenology in four of seven species.
