<p class="p">A comparison with the records of

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Together with the results of previous studies showing that the egg stage in the field lasts 7–10 days (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1978</xref>) and that ca. 80% of the eggs are laid during the first half of the flight season (Wiklund and Friberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2009</xref>), this strongly suggests that our census provided accurate assessments of host use in all regions.
