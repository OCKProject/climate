<p class="p">The average advancement of mean flight date of all 66 butterfly species was 0.36 days/year during the last two decades. Moreover, the mean flight date of the same investigated butterfly species showed a positive correlation with latitude (mean value is 1.20 days/degree of latitude). The advancement in mean flight date as well as the seasonal advancement at lower latitudes was both greater in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> than in the vast majority of other butterfly species in the region. It has advanced its mean flight dates during the last two decades with a mean value of 1.02 days/year, which is among the top three of all investigated butterfly species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In addition, there are only 2 out of 66 species that show a steeper relationship between mean flight date and latitude than 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> (3.41 days/degree of latitude).
