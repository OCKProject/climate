<p class="p">We sampled data both at the level of plots and at the level of plant individuals. In each region, we searched randomly for occurrences of host plants. Whenever patches of one or multiple host plants were found, we established study plots. A plot was defined as the area covered by a patch of single or mixed host species populations, which was separated from the closest patch by at least 25 m. We judge that this design resulted in that differences in abundances among species in surveyed plots, roughly reflected abundances within the larger study region. At the plot level, we estimated the plot area including all the host plants in a patch as well as the total number of host plant individuals per species, yielding estimates of densities for each of the host plant species. Plot area ranged from 18 to 5382 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. We searched all plants within plots for presence of butterfly eggs and estimated the mean number of eggs per plant within each plot as the total number of eggs divided by the number of plants individuals. At the individual level, we measured traits for a random subsample of the plants scored for each population. In populations with less than 100 plants, all plants were measured, whereas random samples of up to 150 plants were measured in larger populations. The measured traits were plant size (maximum shoot length), the total number of flowers on all shoots (total number of buds + flowers + pods at the time of recording), and the phenological state (number of pods divided by the total number of flowers at the time of recording). Overall, 16 453 plants were scored for egg presence at the plot level, and for 6187 of these, we also measured phenotypic traits (Table
