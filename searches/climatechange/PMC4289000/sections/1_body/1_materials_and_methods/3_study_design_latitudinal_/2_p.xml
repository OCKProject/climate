<p class="p">Data were collected between 17 May and 16 June 2010. We selected three regions ranging a 900 km S–N climatic gradient along the Eastern Swedish coast (Electronic Supplementary Material, Fig. 10.1007/s13280-014-0602-7): regions South (Scania Province; 55°49′N, 14°05′E), Centre (Uppland; 59°30′N, 18°35′E), and North (Ångermanland; 63°03′N, 18°19′E). We sampled consecutively in S (17–23 May), in C (28 May–3 June), and N (10–16 June). Within each region, 1–11 populations per host plant species were sampled in an area of approximately 50 km
