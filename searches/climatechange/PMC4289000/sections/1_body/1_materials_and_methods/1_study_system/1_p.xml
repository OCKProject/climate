<p class="p">The focal butterfly species in this study, the Orange-tip 
 <italic class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</italic> (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), and its host plant species constitute a particularly interesting model system to assess potential climate-dependent effects on host use. This butterfly is oligophagous on Brassicaceae using up to 17 different Brassicaceae species from 14 different genera within their range in Sweden (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1978</xref>; Arvanitis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2007</xref>). The species is a phenological specialist in the sense that it feeds only on flowers and seedpods of its host, which are available for a period of approximately 1 month in spring at any given location in Sweden (Wiklund and Åhrberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">1978</xref>; Wiklund and Friberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2009</xref>). As a result of its dependence of host plants that flower relatively early, 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> flies early in the season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Although both the butterfly and its host plants have a wide distribution in Europe, 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> is obligatory univoltine and after larval development in spring, it pupates and enters diapause in early summer. Thus, the species spends most of the summer, and all of autumn and winter in the pupal stage.
