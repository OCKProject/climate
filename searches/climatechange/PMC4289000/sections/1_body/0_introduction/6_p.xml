<p class="p">An additional factor affecting plant and animal phenology is geographic location. The effects of latitude have been extensively scrutinized, and due to climate gradients stretching from south to north, growth and reproduction are generally occurring later in the northern parts (e.g., Myneni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">1997</xref>; Karlsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2007</xref>; Rötzer and Chmielewski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2001</xref>; Doi and Takahashi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2008</xref>). Butterflies show a relatively straightforward pattern with northern populations flying at later dates (Roy and Asher 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2003</xref>; Karlsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, not only phenology may vary along latitudinal gradients, but also the relative importance of different cues. Such differences would imply that plant populations of the same species along a latitudinal gradient respond differently to climate warming. This may lead to different responses among butterfly populations in order to maximize synchronization. Moreover, many butterfly species depend on multiple host plants, which use partly different environmental cues for start of development and that vary in relative abundance along latitudinal gradients. In combination, these relationships suggest that the realized pattern of host use will be affected by variation in climate, whether it is due to latitudinal differences or to long-term climate change. Such climate effects on host use are likely to be particularly important in butterfly species that are specializing on feeding on a specific phenological stage of their hosts. However, the effects of climate variation on patterns of host utilization in phenological specialists have rarely been studied. Indeed, detailed data on climate-induced changes of insect–host plant interactions over long periods of time are overall very rare (Visser and Both 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2005</xref>; Singer and Parmesan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). One way forward is therefore to explore spatial variation in butterfly–host interactions along the climatic gradients of latitude or altitude.
