<p class="p">Here, we review phenological changes in temperate butterflies over the last decades in Sweden and present results from an ongoing project exploring variation in the interaction between one phenological specialist, 
 <italic class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</italic>, and its multiple host plants along a latitudinal cline representing large variation in climate. More specifically we ask (1) How much has mean flight date changed in butterfly species in general, and in 
 <italic class="italic">A. cardamines</italic> in particular, during the last 20Â years in the same geographical area? (2) How well do temporal changes in mean flight dates for these species agree with the spatial trend along a latitudinal gradient? (3) To what degree do life history traits such as voltinism and overwintering stage correlate with changes in mean flight dates of butterflies in general? and (4) How does among- and within-species host plant use in 
 <italic class="italic">Anthocharis cardamines</italic> differs along a latitudinal gradient?
