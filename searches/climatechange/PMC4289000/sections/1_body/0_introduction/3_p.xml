<p class="p">However, recent comparative studies of butterflies in the UK (Diamond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2011</xref>) and in Sweden (Karlsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2013</xref>) reveal that shifts in phenology show a profound variation among species, making a more thorough inspection of the phenological responses justified. Previous studies have shown that variation in phenology shifts among butterfly species is associated with several life history traits, including overwintering stage, seasonal appearance, food plant species as well as several other factors, like food availability, habitat, altitude, and latitude (Altermatt
