<p class="p">Climate change is considered one of the biggest threats to biodiversity today, and many species risk extinction due to a changed climate (Thomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2004</xref>; Parmesan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2006</xref>; Cahill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2013</xref>). Species interactions make up an important part of biodiversity. Yet, knowledge of how such interactions are influenced by climate and habitat change is comparatively sparse (Lavergne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2010</xref>). A change in climate or other environmental conditions may influence the strength of species interactions by relatively rapid plastic responses and by evolutionary changes over generations (Visser and Both 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2005</xref>; Visser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2008</xref>; Altermatt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2010</xref>; Singer and Parmesan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). For example, if the phenology of an herbivore and its host plants in a seasonal environment is differentially influenced by temperature, a change in climate may lead to changes in the temporal overlap between the herbivore and its hosts (e.g., Singer and Parmesan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). As a result, the intensity of the interaction might change, or it may even disappear (Dewar and Watt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1992</xref>; Harrington et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">1999</xref>). In herbivores using multiple hosts, climate change may lead to changes in the relative overlap with different hosts and thus to changes in host use. Such changes in interaction patterns are important to study as they influence both population dynamics and selection regimes, and are fundamental to understand how climate change might influence natural communities (Visser
