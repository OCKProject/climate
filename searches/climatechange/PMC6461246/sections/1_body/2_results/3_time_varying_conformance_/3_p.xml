<p class="p">The smooth SSD examines the heterogeneity within the dataset over time in terms of Benfordâ€™s Law. Our results reject the hypothesis of homogeneity across the entire period of observation, as no horizontal line would fit the credible band of the smooth SSD. For the early decades prior to 1880s, the smooth SSD is susceptible to considerable variability due to small sample size, and hence it is difficult to tell either conformance or lack of conformance. However, ever since then, the posterior mean of the smooth SSD starts soon to increase gradually from the 1880s, reaches a peak value of 0.0184 in 1903, and then returns to a lower level around 1940, which constitute the first long-term cycle in the variation of the smooth SSD. Another substantive long-term deviation is currently in progress since the 1970s. The first peak occurs in 1989 with the posterior mean 0.00995 and then the mean falls slightly to 0.00757, ending up with the highest value of 0.0153 in 2016. As shown in
