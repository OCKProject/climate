<p class="p">Despite the conclusion of [
 <xref rid="pone.0213300.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] that the GTC data tend to conform to Benford’s Law from 1960 onward, our model actually finds a substantial deviation from Benford’s Law over that period. Keeping in mind that technological improvements are cumulative, we find that the most recent heterogeneity levels actually tend to be higher than the ones from 1842 to 1890 (cf 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). This finding seems to be contradiction with [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> in their paper), which is possibly due to the above-mentioned bias issue faced by their approach.
