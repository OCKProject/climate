<p class="p">We now apply our smooth multinomial logistic model to the GTC data. The masterplan of this section is as follows: first, we learn about the dynamics of the first-digit probability; second, we examine conformance of the first-digit probability to Benford’s Law, and assess the homogeneity within the dataset over the observation period; third, we further examine evidence on the behavior of the second-digit probability. To streamline the comparisons with [
