 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">d</italic>,
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 </sub>’s show different patterns over the period between leading digits. As expected, we see that in the very early stage of the dataset, e.g. around the 1850s, the corresponding credible bands are much wider than those in the period of 1900s onward due to small sample sizes (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Among all the nine curves, the probability of leading digit one 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 </sub> has a pronounced variation over the entire period. The posterior mean of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 </sub> rises to around 0.4 until the early 1910s, and then steadily drops for more than a century to around 0.2. This implies that the proportion of cyclones whose traveled distance start with digit one decreased approximately by half from around 1900s to recent years. On the contrary, the dynamics of the probability of leading digit three, i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3,
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 </sub> moves upward the benchmark around the same period as the downward move of leading digit one, although the magnitude of the move is much smaller than that of digit one. The other seven curves move more tightly around the straight line of Benford’s Law, but digit two to digit seven are slightly upward and the others downward the benchmark. Given the variances of the digit probabilities, it is possible that these probabilities stay constant over the observation period S1.
