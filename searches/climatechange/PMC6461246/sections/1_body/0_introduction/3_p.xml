<p class="p">The paper is organized as follows. We first introduce our motivating global tropical cyclone data and provide preliminary statistics on their conformance to Benfordâ€™s Law. The next section describes our proposed Bayesian multinomial logistic smoothing model along with details on prior specification and on inference. The homogeneity of cyclone data is then analyzed by inspecting dynamics of the first-digit distribution. Lastly, we discuss data homogeneity and other issues based on the results. For the convenience of exposition, specific details surrounding numerical experiments on the model and relevant code in R [
