<p class="p">We retrieve observed location records of each cyclone from 1842 to 2016 in the GTC dataset and then trace a geometric path by connecting points which each cyclone traveled. We measure distance per cyclone in meters along the path using the 
 <monospace class="monospace">geosphere</monospace> package [
 <xref rid="pone.0213300.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] from the R programming language. Except for the small cyclones with a single geographical location (latitude/longitude), we obtain 12,741 observations of traveled distances in total; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> depicts the frequency of tropical cyclones over the period under analysis. This allows us to analyze dynamics of the first-digit proportion throughout the period under analysis. Before specifying our statistical model, we first test the overall validity of Benford’s Law in the GTC dataset. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows the proportion of first digits in the GTC dataset against Benford’s Law. The first-digit proportions in the pooled GTC data resemble the probability mass from Benford’s Law. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0213300.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, digit 1 and digit 6 to digit 9 exhibits higher proportion than the probability from 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0213300.e001" class="xref">Eq (1)</xref> among all digits, whereas digits 2 to 4 present lower than the counterpart values. We discuss the variation of each proportion in detail with our time-varying model.
