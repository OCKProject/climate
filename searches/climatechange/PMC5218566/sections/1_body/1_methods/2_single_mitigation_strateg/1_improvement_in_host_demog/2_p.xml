 <bold class="bold">Malaria tolerance.</bold> We modeled potential evolution of malaria-tolerance from theoretical models of the evolution of disease tolerance for simple Mendelian inheritance [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. We accounted for evolution of tolerance by using separate subpopulations of malaria-tolerant and malaria-susceptible birds for each Hawaiian species. Subpopulations had identical demographics, but differed in malaria mortality. We assumed there is no fitness cost for development of malaria tolerance. For potential evolution of malaria tolerance we assumed a small number of tolerant birds were present in 2004 because our simulations showed that disease risk (selection pressure) at mid-elevation is currently large enough for successful development of malaria-tolerant native birds. In our simulations these subpopulations were allowed to grow and/or decline independently based on elevation-specific malaria transmission rates (selection pressure) and their simulated degree of malaria-tolerance. Malaria fatality rates for susceptible Amakihi (68%), Apapane (47%), and Iiwi (93%) were estimated from capture-recapture data for wild birds across high and mid elevations [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. For malaria-tolerant Amakihi, we used a malaria fatality rate of 2.5% based on estimates for low-elevation Amakihi [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Without evidence for malaria tolerance in Apapane or Iiwi, we simulated three different levels of reduction (25%, 50%, and 75%) in malaria mortality.
