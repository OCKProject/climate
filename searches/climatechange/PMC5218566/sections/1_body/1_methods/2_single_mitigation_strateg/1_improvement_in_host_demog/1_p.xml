<p class="p">Population growth rate and population persistence are positively correlated: larger population growth rates are associated with longer population persistence time and smaller risk of extinction [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Population growth is determined by population demographics including survival rate, sex ratio, mortality, migration, reproduction, carrying capacity, and other factors. We considered two approaches designed to increase population growth rate and persistence: 1) reduction of disease-associated mortality through evolution of malaria-tolerance and 2) improvements in adult survival and reproductive success through removal of predators.
