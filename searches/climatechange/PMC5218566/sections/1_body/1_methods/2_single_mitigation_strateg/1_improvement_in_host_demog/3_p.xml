<p class="p">To determine the evolutionary potential for development of a malaria-tolerant population of birds we conducted a pilot simulation based on malaria-tolerant Amakihi in low-elevation forests. We found that small initial subpopulations of malaria-tolerant birds consisting of 1%, 2% or 5% of the total population became dominant within less than 50 years, providing a reasonable representation of the observed recovery of the Amakihi at low elevation [
