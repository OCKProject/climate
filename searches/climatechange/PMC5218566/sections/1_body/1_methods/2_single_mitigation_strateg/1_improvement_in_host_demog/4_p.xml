 <bold class="bold">Predator removal.</bold> Summarized nesting success from 36 studies of 19 Hawaiian forest birds showed predator removal had limited ability to improve nest success for Iiwi (2–10%) and Amakihi (10–15%), but a larger impact on Apapane (10–30%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Despite the rather equivocal data on predator control for Hawaiian birds, previous models evaluated the potential population effects of rodent control by modeling 25%, 50%, and 75% reductions in adult mortality and 20%, 35%, and 50% reductions in nest predation [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. To estimate the potential effect of predator control on native birds, we simulated optimistic effects of predator removal by increasing bird fecundity by 5%, 10%, 25% or 50%, and simultaneously decreasing adult natural mortality by 25% or 50%.
