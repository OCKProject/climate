 <bold class="bold">Sterile and incompatible male mosquitoes.</bold> The sterile male technique (SMT) has been historically used to control agricultural pests and vectors of human or livestock disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. SMT is based on releasing overwhelming numbers of sterile males that are produced through irradiation, chemical treatment, or genetic modification. They compete with wild males to mate with wild females. The mating between wild females and sterile males produce few, if any, viable offspring, thus reducing the mosquito population in the next generation. Repeated applications of this strategy are aimed at substantially reducing or eradicating local vector populations. Releases of irradiated and chemically treated male mosquitoes have been used successfully at small scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. However, a more promising technology is based on genetic enhancement of SMT based on insertion of dominant lethal genes (RIDL, Oxitec Ltd
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>) into the genome. Lethal genes are only expressed in the zygotes, rather than in the father, which greatly improves the ability of sterile males to compete with wild males for mates. To date the RIDL system was primarily developed for
