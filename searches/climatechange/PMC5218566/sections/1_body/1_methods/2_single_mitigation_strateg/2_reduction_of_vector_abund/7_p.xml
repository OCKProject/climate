<p class="p">Studies using genetically modified 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and crosses of 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes infected with incompatible 
 <italic class="italic">Wolbachia</italic> strains demonstrated high egg mortality in affected females (&gt;90%), but a wide range of mating competitiveness (0.1–1) [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Therefore we simulated three scenarios for mating competitiveness 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9; and three levels of egg mortality 90%, 95%, and 99% in females that mate with modified males. Mosquitoes are more abundant during the dry season (fall) than in the wet season [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]; thus, we conducted simulations by releasing the male mosquitoes beginning in April, and continuing the release for 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. As mosquito abundance varies substantially between high and mid elevations, we started with a release number (S) of 10 times the predicted wild mosquito density (N). Using a recursive approach, we varied the number of release months and mosquitoes released until we were able to identify critical model parameter values that achieved our conservation goal (PGR ≥ 1).
