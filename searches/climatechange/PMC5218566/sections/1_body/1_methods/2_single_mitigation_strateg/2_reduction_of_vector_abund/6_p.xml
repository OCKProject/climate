<p class="p">Although these two approaches are based on different mechanisms (SMT depending on lethal genes, irradiation, and chemical sterilization; CI depending on natural incompatibilities between 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes infected with different strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Wolbachia</italic>), both are designed to decrease the number of viable eggs and limit mosquito recruitment. Therefore, we modeled these two approaches by assuming a proportion (P) of wild females mate with sterile males or males infected with incompatible 
 <italic class="italic">Wolbachia</italic> strains, such that matings produce a smaller proportion (1- egg mortality) of viable eggs, which can develop to normal larvae. The remaining (1-P) females mate with normal males, and produce normal viable eggs. These two approaches include four parameters: the annual/seasonal time period when male mosquitoes are released, the density of male mosquitoes released (S per km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), the mating competitiveness between the sterile (S) or incompatible males and normal males (C), and the egg mortality achieved by the mating. The mating proportion, P, is determined by the mating competitiveness, the density/abundance of normal (N) and sterile or incompatible males, by the formula:
