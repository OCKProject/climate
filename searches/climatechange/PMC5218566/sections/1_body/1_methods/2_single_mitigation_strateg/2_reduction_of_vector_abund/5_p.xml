This approach is based on bidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI), the abortive embryonic development occurs when males infected with one strain of the bacterium are crossed with uninfected females or females infected with an incompatible strain. This can substantially decrease the number of viable eggs produced by female mosquitoes [
