<p class="p">Considering the many uncertainties related to fitness cost of the refractory mosquitoes, development of gene drive systems, and the rate of refractory gene(s) fixation, we used a simple approach to simulate refractory mosquitoes in our model. For each day (time step), we assumed a fixed percentage of infectious mosquitoes were refractory (denoted by Ref%) in the population. Lacking a field evaluation of feeding rates of refractory mosquitoes, we assumed that susceptible birds are bitten in proportion to the relative abundance of refractory and wild infectious mosquitoes. So Ref% birds are bitten by refractory mosquitoes and these susceptible birds will not become infected with avian malaria (disease transmission rate is 0). The remaining (100%â€”Ref%) susceptible birds are bitten by wild mosquitoes capable of transmitting malaria [
