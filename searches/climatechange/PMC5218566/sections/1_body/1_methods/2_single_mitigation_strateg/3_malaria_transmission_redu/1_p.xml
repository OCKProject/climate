<p class="p">Refractory transgenic mosquitoes provide an emerging alternative to traditional vector control based on source reduction, insecticides, or biocontrol. Molecular tools are used to identify and transplant refractory gene(s) (conferring inability to transmit disease) inside the vector to interfere with pathogen transmission to susceptible hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. As a result, the proportion of mosquitoes that are infectious to birds is reduced, leading to reductions in malaria transmission to birds.
