<p class="p">The long history of attempted control of vector-borne diseases suggests that single solutions will not be adequate to address avian malaria transmission in Hawaii and that integrated approaches will be necessary [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009" class="xref">results</xref>), especially under hotter and/or wetter climatic projections (RCP8.5 and/or A1B), we also evaluated several combined mitigation strategies. We focused on two groups of combined strategies. First, feral pig removal plus either predator removal or the release of sterile males/males infected with incompatible

Because it was impractical to evaluate the entire model parameter space for several of these combined approaches, we identified combined strategies with parameters that were successful in maintaining bird abundance by 2100 (PGR â‰¥ 1). We evaluated the combined strategies under RCP8.5, the most severe climate prediction for future malaria transmission, in high- and mid-elevation forests.
