<p class="p">We evaluated the performance of different avian malaria conservation strategies on native Hawaiian forest bird populations and malaria transmission under 3 alternative future climate change projections for the 21

Three climatic projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) including phase 3 A1B, and phase 5 Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century were used to drive the epidemiological model [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Simulations used a 24-year burn-in run with historical weather patterns, estimated malaria free bird densities, and 100 infectious adult mosquitoes per km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to generate initial state values. These initial values were inputs for a 24-year baseline simulation using daily weather data from 1980–2003 (including inter-annual and inter-decadal climate variations). We predicted the future daily temperature and rainfall through linear interpolation of the projected temperature and rainfall changes between 2004 and 2100 for each of the three alternative climate projections (see details in [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]). We summarized the daily results into annual and 10-year intervals to interpret the long-term trends for bird and mosquito densities, prevalence of infected vectors and hosts, and risk of malaria infection. Simulations were performed using the ode45 solver in Matlab version R2011b (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Details of the bird-mosquito-malaria model and climate scenarios including model equations, parameter definitions and values, and climate trends are described in [
