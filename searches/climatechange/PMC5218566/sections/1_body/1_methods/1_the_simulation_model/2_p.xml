 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0168880.e001" class="xref">eq 1</xref> below) for bird abundance to evaluate the performance of each malaria mitigation strategy. Successful conservation strategies had a PGR â‰¥ 1, which allows current bird populations to persist or grow. We found PGR to provide a reasonable metric for representing long-term population changes for Hawaiian honeycreepers with the exception of Iiwi populations at mid-elevation. Currently Iiwi have very low abundance in mid-elevation forests because of avian malaria; therefore, PGR values near 1 primarily indicated the population continued to exist, but was not recovering. Instead PGR &gt;&gt; 10 for mid-elevation Iiwi indicated this threatened population of birds was benefiting.
