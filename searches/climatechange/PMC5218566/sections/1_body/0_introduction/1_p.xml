<p class="p">Endemic Hawaiian honeycreepers (
 <italic class="italic">Passeriformes Drepanididae</italic>) were once abundant in forests throughout Hawai’i [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Unfortunately today, most of these species are extinct, have severely reduced populations, or are restricted to high elevation forests. Hawaiian forest birds are considered one of the most threatened group of forest-dependent birds in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. There are multiple causes for their declines including habitat destruction, and the introduction of predators and avian competitors [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. However, introduced avian malaria (
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium relictum</italic>) transmitted by the southern house mosquitoes (
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) is considered to be a key factor limiting present distribution and abundance of the remaining Hawaiian native birds [
