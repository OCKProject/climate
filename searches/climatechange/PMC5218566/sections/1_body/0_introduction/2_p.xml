<p class="p">A comprehensive epidemiological model of the Hawaiian forest bird-malaria system illustrates that transmission varies across altitudes on Hawai’i Island; from high year-round transmission in warm lowland forests, to seasonal episodic transmission at mid elevation, and infrequent summer infections at cool high elevations [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Consequently, predicted climate change will substantially alter the geographic and elevational distribution of malaria pathogens by facilitating transmission in high-elevation forests, currently with low disease transmission, and increasing transmission at lower elevations [
