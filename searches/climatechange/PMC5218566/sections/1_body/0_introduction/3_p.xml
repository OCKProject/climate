<p class="p">To evaluate the altitudinal and temporal impacts of future climate change on avian malaria transmission in Hawaiian forest birds, we previously [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] linked three climate projections representing warm and dry (RCP 4.5), warm and wet (A1B), and hot and dry (RCP 8.5) futures, with our epidemiological model [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] to predict malaria prevalence, mosquito abundance, and bird dynamics until the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Fortini et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] evaluated climate associated habitat changes to estimate habitat suitability for Hawaiian birds during the next century. Both studies indicated that future climate change will likely cause an increase in malaria transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], reduction in suitable habitat [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and decrease in the abundance of the remaining Hawaiian honeycreepers. In high-elevation forests, malaria transmission is predicted to become more frequent and intense during the second half of this century, resembling seasonal epidemics currently found in mid-elevation forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. As a result, even for the most optimistic climatic projection, malaria sensitive birds will be increasingly exposed to malaria infection, and likely suffer severe population declines and/or extinctions. In mid-elevation forests, seasonal transmission becomes longer and more intense for all three climatic projections, and may lead to mid-elevation extinction for disease susceptible Iiwi populations, which have already been decimated by malaria. In contrast to mid and high elevations, lowland forests have high malaria transmission because this is a highly favorable environment for mosquitoes and malaria transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, predicted future climate changes will have only limited additional impacts on malaria transmission at low elevation. Recent studies have demonstrated that only the Hawai’i Amakihi (
 <italic class="italic">Chlorodrepanis virens</italic>) has been able to evolve malaria tolerance and re-populate low-elevation forests in the face of high malaria transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]; providing limited optimism that evolution of malaria tolerance may also allow other native Hawaiian birds to avoid extinction.
