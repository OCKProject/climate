<p class="p">Our previous research predicted that climate change will increase malaria transmission in mid-elevation forests causing additional impacts on native bird abundance [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Here, we extend these results by showing that climate change and resulting intensity of malaria transmission has a direct connection with the effectiveness of future malaria mitigation strategies. Among all of the single mitigation strategies, our simulations indicated that evolution of malaria tolerance, application of sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes, or use of refractory mosquitoes could be successful conservation actions for maintaining current levels of high-elevation native birds with moderate (Amakihi) or high malaria sensitivity (Iiwi) by 2100. We found that management actions such as predator removal or feral pig control may, temporarily or longer-term, postpone population declines until alternative strategies can be developed. In mid-elevation forests which are favorable for mosquito demographics and malaria parasite development, high rates of malaria infection reduced the effectiveness of many mitigation strategies. As a result, most single mitigation strategies will likely be unsuccessful in maintaining or increasing mid-elevation bird populations.
