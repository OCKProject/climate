<p class="p">If other species of Hawaiian birds were able to evolve malaria tolerance then future population declines and extinctions might be avoided. However, the potential for evolution of malaria-tolerance in many honeycreepers likely depends on complex factors including population demographics, selection pressure, genetic diversity, landscape level gene flow, habitat quality, food resources, predation, and competition [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Our results suggest assuming evolution of malaria tolerance in most Hawaiian species is likely overly optimistic for several reasons. First, our simulations did not consider any fitness costs for the development of malaria-tolerance [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Second, the reduction in malaria mortality that tolerant birds need to achieve is substantial for malaria sensitive Hawaiian populations like Iiwi. Limited improvement in the malaria fatality rate (Î¼
 <sub class="sub">D</sub> = 70%) was not sufficient to reverse predicted population declines for high or mid elevations. So far, large reductions in malaria fatality rates have only been documented in low-elevation Amakihi, and the specific genotype(s) responsible for malaria tolerance has not been determined [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Based on the history of population extinction, declines, and restricted distribution for endemic Hawaiian birds caused by avian malaria it seems unlikely that many native species will be able to evolve malaria tolerance. Finally, species that develop tolerance would become a disease reservoir that can infect susceptible mosquitoes and transmit disease to the remaining susceptible birds [
