<p class="p">Our results indicated that development of malaria tolerance is one of the potential future scenarios for native Hawaiian species to survive future climate change. Currently, susceptibility to avian malaria varies among species of Hawaiian forest birds with mortality exceeding 90% in highly-susceptible Iiwi [

Interestingly, in this study we found that Apapane populations at mid and high elevation were not substantially impacted by future increases in avian malaria transmission (results not shown), suggesting that Apapane may have also developed (or perhaps always had) sufficient malaria tolerance to persist even under future disease increases. We found that Apapane and low-elevation Amakihi have sufficient ability to cope with malaria infection; therefore, no mitigation actions are needed to maintain these populations during this century.
