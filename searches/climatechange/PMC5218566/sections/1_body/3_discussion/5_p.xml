<p class="p">We found development of refractory 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes provided an alternative approach to protect Hawaiian forest birds. However, the long-term success of this action depended on whether the refractory mosquitoes could completely (in mid elevation) or largely (≥ 90% in high-elevation) replace the wild mosquito population. Although most research has focused on 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes (which transmit dengue fever or human malaria) it has been reported that 
 <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>, the avian malaria vector in Hawai’i, could also express the transposable element required for the gene drive mechanism [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. The development of the CRISPAR Cas9 gene editing system as a gene drive for refractory genes is a potential game changer depending on the further development of system safeguards and regulatory acceptance [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. However, implementing this strategy in 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes still requires additional technological advances including: 1) identification of refractory (anti-pathogen) gene(s) for avian malaria; 2) regulations and acceptance of CRISPR technology; and 3) conducting field tests to determine the efficiency of this method (no field tests have yet been conducted) [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In contrast to the release of sterile/incompatible males, this strategy is predicted to leave a high abundance of mosquitoes on the landscape. While these mosquitoes would be unable to transmit avian malaria they could be effective vectors of other diseases that could impact Hawaiian honeycreepers.
