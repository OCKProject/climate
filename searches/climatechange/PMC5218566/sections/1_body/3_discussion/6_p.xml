<p class="p">Introduced predators have played an important role in the decline of many insular bird populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. In Hawai’i, introduced mammals such as black rats, feral cats, and mongooses prey on eggs, fledglings, or even adult birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. One study of Oahu Elepaio (
 <italic class="italic">Chasiempis ibidis</italic>) found that rodent control improved female survival (nearly 50%), fecundity (&gt; 100%), and nest success (near 100%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In contrast, no difference in nest success or abundance was detected in native forest birds during predator control at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge from 1996 to 1999 [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. A rat control experiment using Kipukas (patches of native forest surrounded by lava flows) on Hawai’i Island during 2012 (Jessie Knowlton, Pers. Comm.) showed no significant improvement in nest success for Apapane, Amakihi, and Iiwi. Thus, potential impacts of predator removal on Hawaiian birds may be minor and/or depend on the specific ecological situation and predator characteristics [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. We simulated a large range of potential demographic improvements for Amakihi and Iiwi by reducing adult natural (non-malaria) mortality and increasing fecundity. Whether such improvements can be achieved in practice is unknown, but previous studies suggest these goals are unlikely. Even with optimistic demographic improvements, our simulations showed predator removal alone was generally not sufficient to restore forest bird populations, especially for disease sensitive species. However, predator control was complementary to other mitigation actions, such as feral pig control (

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>), provided bird populations have the genetic capability to develop tolerance. Currently, the costs and success of conducting long-term, landscape scale predator removal programs in Hawaiian forests are unknown.
