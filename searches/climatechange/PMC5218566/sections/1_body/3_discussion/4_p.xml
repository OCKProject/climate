<p class="p">Release of sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes provided another promising strategy to combat avian malaria transmission. Our simulations showed that sufficient release of sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes can result in dramatic declines in mosquito abundance in mid elevation during the initial part of the century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0168880.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), allowing populations of Amakihi and Iiwi to dramatically increase. However, success of this strategy depends heavily on mating competition of sterile/incompatible males compared to wild males and egg mortality rates, which are currently unknown for 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes. If the mating competition is low, it would require extended release periods and a large number of sterile/incompatible males to successfully reduce mosquito abundance and malaria transmission. In addition, the cost and feasibility of releasing sufficient mosquito numbers for a substantial portion of the year over a large heterogeneous, forested landscape and for long periods of time requires further research and cost benefit analysis. We suspect that development of aerial methods of mosquito release using manned or unmanned aircraft will be required to implement this strategy on the mountainous Hawaiian landscape. An important benefit of this strategy would be a dramatic reduction in the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> mosquitoes; substantially reducing the potential future risk of newly introduced vector-borne diseases (e.g., West Nile Virus) to Hawaiian honeycreepers.
