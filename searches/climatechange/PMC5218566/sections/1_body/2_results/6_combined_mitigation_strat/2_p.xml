 <xref rid="pone.0168880.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>) for the RCP8.5 climate projection. We found additive results when malaria-tolerance was combined with predator removal. These strategies were complementary because tolerance reduced malaria mortality and predator removal reduced natural mortality and increased fecundity, thus, both improved host demographics. As a result, population levels consistently increased (PGR &gt; 1) for both Iiwi and Amakihi at mid and high elevation (
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). In contrast, the success of malaria tolerance combined with feral pig control differed by elevation. At high elevation feral pig control reduced selection pressure to develop malaria-tolerance and therefore the abundance of both Iiwi and Amakihi (
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) also decreased. However, in mid-elevation forests, with higher selection pressure, the addition of feral pig control was either neutral or slightly positive for long-term Iiwi and Amakihi populations; malaria infection remained sufficient to favor malaria-tolerance in mid-elevation populations. The results for combining malaria tolerance with refractory mosquitoes were more complex. In high elevation where the selection pressure was generally low, a refractory mosquito percentage less than the threshold (Ref% &lt; 90%) reduced selection pressure and prevented tolerant birds (especially Iiwi) from becoming the dominant subpopulation, so bird density declines. However, once a successful refractory mosquito threshold was achieved avian malaria was not a threat for native birds because only a small percent of mosquitoes transmitted disease to susceptible birds. Incorporating refractory mosquitoes with potential malaria tolerance at mid elevation provided only a slight advantage for development of tolerance among Hawaiian native birds (
