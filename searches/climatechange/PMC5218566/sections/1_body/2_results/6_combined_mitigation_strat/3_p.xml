<p class="p">The combination of malaria tolerance with release of sterile or incompatible male mosquitoes produced complex patterns based on species, malaria induced mortalities, and elevation (Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). Either malaria tolerance or sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes alone maintained or substantially increased Amakihi populations (PGR â‰¥ 1) at high and mid elevations and combining both actions did not produce adverse results, although there was no obvious synergy. The pattern was mixed for more disease-sensitive species, such as Iiwi. If the malaria fatality rate was reduced to less than 25%, Iiwi maintained stable populations in high elevation and recovered in mid elevation. The addition of sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes had insignificant or negative effects for Iiwi in both elevations, depending on the level of mating competition. However, if the malaria mortality was higher than 25%, incorporating sterile/incompatible mosquitoes benefited Iiwi populations, not by increasing malaria-tolerant birds, but by reducing wild mosquito abundance and helping malaria-susceptible birds. Due to the different level of selection pressure, highly competitive sterile/incompatible male mosquitoes assisted Iiwi populations in high elevation, but not Iiwi in mid-elevation forests (Tables
