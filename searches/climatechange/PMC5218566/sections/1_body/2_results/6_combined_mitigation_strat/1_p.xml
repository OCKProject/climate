<p class="p">To evaluate potential integrated strategies and address the limited success in maintaining future bird populations using most single mitigation strategies, we also evaluated a number of combined strategies for the RCP8.5 climate projection. We simulated feral pig control in combination with predator removal or release of sterile or incompatible male mosquitoes for RCP8.5. The combined strategies of feral pig control and predator removal showed a high degree of success for Amakihi populations for both mid and high elevation and all levels of predator removal (

In contrast, this combined strategy was not successful in maintaining Iiwi populations at either elevation unless predator removal achieved unlikely demographic improvements. The combination of feral pig control with sterile or incompatible male mosquitoes predicted the most successful outcomes with substantial increases in Amakihi in both mid- and high-elevation forests under most parameter combinations (
