At mid elevation, climate is already favorable for mosquitoes and there is sufficient natural larval habitat, so all three climate scenarios predicted high mosquito populations with substantial future impacts on Amakihi (PGR &lt; 0.15), and likely extinction of Iiwi (PGR &lt; 0.05). Where natural cavities are relatively abundant, future declines in honeycreeper populations were likely even in actively managed areas such as Volcano National Park where pigs have already been eliminated. In high-elevation forests, which are climatically less favorable for mosquitoes, results from pig control differed for the three climatic projections. If the future climate is moderate (RCP4.5), pig control was effective in maintaining populations of Amakihi and Iiwi. However, if the future is more favorable for mosquitoes (A1B or RCP8.5) pig control could be beneficial to Amakihi, but it would not reverse the predicted decline in Iiwi (PGR &lt; 0.35). Although pig control did not meet our conservation goal (PGR â‰¥ 1), simulations show that this strategy could postpone predicted high elevation bird population declines by two to four decades (
