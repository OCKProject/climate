<p class="p">Our simulations showed that Amakihi populations can benefit (PGR &gt; 1) from relatively small demographic improvements that might be achievable with predator reduction programs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168880.s007" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). Even under the worst climate projections (RCP8.5) Amakihi populations improved in mid- and high-elevation forests with these relatively minor demographic improvements. In contrast, Iiwi showed continued population decline (PGR &lt; 1) even with unrealistically large demographic improvements from predator removal (50% reduction in natural mortality and 50% increase in fecundity). Under the most optimistic climatic projection (RCP4.5) and these unrealistic demographic improvements, high-elevation Iiwi populations remained, but at reduced abundance (maximum PGR = 0.86). For more likely climatic projections (RCP8.5) high-elevation Iiwi populations declined by &gt; 50%, even with substantial demographic improvement. Mid-elevation Iiwi, which are currently uncommon, continued to decline under most climate projections and were likely to vanish from mid-elevation forests.
