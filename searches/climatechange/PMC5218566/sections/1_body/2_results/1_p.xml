<p class="p">Malaria-tolerant Amakihi are the primary native honeycreeper able to thrive in lowland forests with high transmission of avian malaria [

 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Although Apapane are also found in lowland forests their abundance is limited. As a result, we did not evaluate the potential viability of conservation strategies in these low-elevation areas. For both mid and high elevations, our evaluations showed that Apapane populations were relatively stable (predicted population declines &lt; 20%) for even the worst climatic climate projection [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Therefore, we focused our detailed evaluations on Amakihi and Iiwi at high and mid elevations. Of these two species, Iiwi are highly sensitive to avian malaria and provide a likely surrogate for other threatened and endangered birds that currently only reside at high elevation where avian malaria infection is minimal. Japanese White-eyes, an introduced bird, were included in our epidemiological model as a potential malaria reservoir, but we did not evaluate their population changes because they are not affected by avian malaria [
