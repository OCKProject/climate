<p class="p">Our simulations evaluating evolution of malaria tolerance showed that population growth between 2010 and 2100 (PGR) depended on elevation-specific malaria transmission rates (selection pressure), climate change projections, species, magnitude of reduction of malaria-induced mortality, and to a lesser extent the initial frequency of tolerant birds in the population (

High selection pressure (high malaria transmission) tended to favor malaria tolerant birds, which increased in abundance to become the dominant portion of the population. At mid elevation, climatic projections that increased malaria transmission favor the evolution of malaria tolerant birds, which lead to an increase in bird abundance (

As a result, evolution of malaria tolerance was more likely to be successful at mid elevation or for climate patterns that favor higher malaria transmission at high elevation (greater improvement in PGR,
