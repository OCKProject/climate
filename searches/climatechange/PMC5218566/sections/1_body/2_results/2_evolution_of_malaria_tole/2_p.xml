<p class="p">Population benefits derived by evolving malaria tolerance depended on the species susceptibility and the amount of reduction (tolerance) in malaria mortality. Tolerant low-elevation Amakihi had a substantial reduction in malaria mortality compared to Amakihi at higher elevations [
 <xref rid="pone.0168880.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This reduced level of mortality favored the tolerant subpopulation, which became dominant (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168880.s006" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). However, for highly susceptible Iiwi, with no evidence of malaria tolerance, future abundance depended on the magnitude of evolved reduction in malaria mortality. Unless Iiwi can evolve tolerance to malaria infection that reduces mortality by at least 50â€“75% in areas with high selection pressure (mid-elevation or RCP8.5/A1B in high elevation,
