As a result of the favorable climate after 2060, mosquito abundance and malaria transmission increased causing bird populations to decline to levels closer to current abundance. However, simulations indicated the possibility that disease-sensitive species such as Iiwi could re-colonize the mid-elevation habitats if vector abundance and malaria transmission were substantially reduced.
