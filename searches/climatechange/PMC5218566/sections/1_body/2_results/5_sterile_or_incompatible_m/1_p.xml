<p class="p">Use of sterile or incompatible male mosquitoes to reduce the number of the viable eggs and decrease abundance of adult mosquitoes required modification of several model parameters (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec002" class="xref">methods</xref>) each with many potential levels, resulting in hundreds of potential outcomes. To evaluate the general patterns we reported simulations that succeeded in maintaining future bird abundance (PGR â‰¥ 1) and compared those with similar parameters that were not successful. These results are intended to provide a guideline for mosquito release criteria to successfully maintain future bird populations.
