<p class="p">In high-elevation forests, success of the sterile/incompatible male strategy varied with future climatic projections, bird species, and competition between released sterile/incompatible males and wild males (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0168880.s010" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>). For the most optimistic climatic projection (RCP4.5), Amakihi and Iiwi had sustainable populations (PGR â‰¥ 1) if there was moderate mating competition (Competition = 0.5, egg mortality = 90%) between released and wild mosquitoes. If the climate was more favorable for mosquitoes (RCP8.5/A1B) or birds were more susceptible to avian malaria (Iiwi), sustaining birds until 2100 required that released mosquitoes are more competitive with wild mosquitoes. Alternatively, maintaining bird populations could also be achieved with higher egg mortality, a longer period of releasing mosquitoes, or releasing a larger number of mosquitoes (
