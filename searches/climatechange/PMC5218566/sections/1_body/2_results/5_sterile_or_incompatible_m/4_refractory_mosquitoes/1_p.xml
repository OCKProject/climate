<p class="p">Due to insufficient information on the potential application of refractory mosquitoes for controlling malaria, we simulated the infectious mosquito population where we assumed a fixed percentage (50–100%) of the mosquito population was refractory and therefore unable to transmit avian malaria to birds. Simulation results showed marginal benefits from applying this strategy at mid elevation for Iiwi and Amakihi unless wild mosquitoes were nearly eliminated (

Our results indicated this strategy reduced the density of infectious mosquitoes; however, environmental conditions in mid-elevation forests are favorable enough that the remaining wild mosquito population maintained substantial malaria transmission. In high-elevation forests, the benefits of this strategy differed among climatic projections and avian species. This action was most successful for the moderate climatic projection (RCP4.5). High-elevation Amakihi benefited (PGR ≥ 1) from the strategy with a lower frequency of refractory mosquitoes (Ref% = 50% for RCP4.5, Ref% = 80% for RCP8.5, and A1B,

In contrast, maintaining at least 90% refractory mosquitoes in the population was necessary for maintaining malaria-susceptible species in severe climates (RCP8.5 or A1B). Although maintaining a lower proportion (80%) of refractory mosquitoes did not achieve a stable population, this level delayed honeycreeper declines for several decades (
