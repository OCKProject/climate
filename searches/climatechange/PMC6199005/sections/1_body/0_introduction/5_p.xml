<p class="p">Although ample knowledge is available for the direct effects (although the interactions are not completely understood), evidence of the indirect effects of agricultural adaptation options on soil functions is more scattered and difficult to derive experimentally because it depends on an uncertain future climate and corresponding adaptation. However, the anticipation of development pathway impacts is a precondition for decision‚Äêmaking.</p>
