<p class="p">Soil systems are fundamental to sustainable development due to their multifunctional role in providing services including biomass production (food, feed, fibre, and fuel); habitats for living organisms and gene pools (biodiversity); cleaning of water and air; mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions; contributions to carbon (C) sequestration; buffering of precipitation extremes; and provisions to cultural, recreational, and human health assets (Coyle, Creamer, Schulte, O'Sullivan, &amp; Jordan,

The effects of climate change are associated with increases in temperature (T) and extreme weather events such as heavy rainfall, droughts, frosts, storms, and rising sea levels in coastal areas. These effects may also increase the threats to soil such as soil erosion, soil compaction, reduced soil fertility, and lowered agricultural productivity, which ultimately deteriorate food security and environmental sustainability (Lal et al.,
