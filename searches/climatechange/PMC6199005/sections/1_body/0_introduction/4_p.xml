<p class="p">The indirect effects of climate change on soil functions include those that are induced by climate change adaptation options. Agricultural management can mitigate climate change effects, for example, through increased soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration (Haddaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Farmers may implement adaptations as a result of multiple, intertwined driving forces, including market price changes, new technologies, and improved knowledge in combination with climate change (Reidsma et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>). Regarding European agriculture, several scenario studies have investigated agricultural adaptation options in response to climate change, including the introduction of irrigation regimes in drought‐prone areas, crop rotation changes, increased fertilization rates on cropland, amended soil tillage practices, and cultivation of melting permafrost soils (Mandryk, Reidsma, &amp; van Ittersum,
