<p class="p">Climate change can affect soil functions directly and indirectly. The direct effects include soil process changes in organic carbon transformations and nutrient cycling through altered moisture and T regimes in the soil or increased soil erosion rates due to an increased frequency of high‐intensity rainfall events. Blum (
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) was among the first to frame a systematic concept of linking soil processes via soil functions to services for the environment and society in Europe. Climate change and soil management can change the ability of soils to perform soil functions, which, for the sake of simplicity, the study calls changes in soil functions. Several studies have assessed the effects of climate change on soil functions (Coyle et al.,
