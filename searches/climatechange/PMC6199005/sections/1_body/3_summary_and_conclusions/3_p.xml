<p class="p">The results of this study provide some clear general insights. They show that adaptation options are expected to reduce the threats of soil erosion and declining SOC in most cases. Soil compaction remains a major threat. Little knowledge is available regarding the decline in soil biodiversity. Therefore, future research should focus on these shortcomings. Furthermore, the adaptation options reveal generally positive effects on the soil functions of food and biomass production, C sequestration in soil, and improvements in storing, filtering, transforming, and recycling capacities. Impacts on soil microorganisms and soil fauna are poorly understood. The results suggest that anticipated climate change adaptation options in agriculture have the potential to offset some of the deteriorating impacts of climate change on soil functions if farmers implement them based on the best available knowledge. In addition, the linkage between soil functions and the SDGs indicates a positive contribution to achieving SDGs 2 (achieving food security and promoting sustainable agriculture) and 13 (taking actions on climate change), whereas a clear signal regarding impacts on SDG 15 (using terrestrial ecosystems sustainably) could not be identified.</p>
