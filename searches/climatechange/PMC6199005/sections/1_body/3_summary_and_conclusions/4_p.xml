<p class="p">Finally, this study demonstrated that despite the broad range of local contexts and farming systems assessed in the 20 case‐studies across Europe, it is possible to identify converging win–win policies that are able to support adaptation options that could, at the same time, minimize soil threats and enhance multiple soil functions. However, more studies are needed in the future to support this ambition given the uncertainties inherent to climate change, its implications for long‐term soil process dynamics, interactions with agricultural practices, and the multiple interacting factors affecting the consequences of adaptation options as well as the market, technology, and policy changes for soils.</p>
