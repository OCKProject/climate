<p class="p">In addition to reducing soil threats, most of the adaptation options were found to have positive effects on some soil functions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Adaptation options were expected to increase agricultural food and biomass production in 80% of the case‐studies. This finding reveals that the integration of climate change adaptation and yield increase was plausible for the time range of the studies (i.e., the years 2025–2100). In the example of Oristanese (IT), decreased rainfall in the spring and more frequent and extreme droughts are expected as part of climate change. Adaptation of crop varieties/hybrids and improved organic fertilizer use and management have been proposed to offset such climate change challenges when irrigation water is available (Dono et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which may result in increased crop and biomass production due to the extended growing season, the CO
