<p class="p">Similar to the results of soil threats, the impacts on the function of soils as a habitat and gene pool are largely unknown. Of the 20 case‐studies, only six (30%) addressed the impacts of agricultural adaptation on soil biodiversity. The obvious ignorance of soil biodiversity issues in most of the case‐studies is a mismatch with the emerging knowledge of the important functional role of soil organisms for soil processes (Cluzeau et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This is a clear knowledge gap that must be addressed in the future. Among the few cases addressing biodiversity, Odgaard, Bøcher, Dalgaard, and Svenning (
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) proposed adaptation, including changing crop rotations (e.g., reduced maize area) for Norsminde (DK). Increasing drainage and extending buffer zones along water courses (Christen &amp; Dalgaard, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) can be responses to more extreme weather events. Local experts in Norsminde expect positive impacts on habitats with larger and perhaps more diverse gene pools. In general, in Denmark, there is a trend towards more organic farming, which will ultimately promote soil biodiversity.
