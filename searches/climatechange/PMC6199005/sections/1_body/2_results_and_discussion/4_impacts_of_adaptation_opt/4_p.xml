<p class="p">The storing, filtering, transforming, and recycling functions of soils were also found to be positively impacted by the adaptation options in 70% of the case‐studies. For example, in the Broye (CH) case‐study, increasing irrigation resulted in a denser and more permanent crop cover throughout the year and therefore helped to maintain agricultural productivity and to reduce nutrient losses through leaching or soil loss through water erosion. Furthermore, it was found that both conservation soil management and an increase in the share of winter crops can contribute to a reduction in soil loss by providing soil coverage, particularly during the periods of the year with the most intense rainfall events (Klein, Holzkämper, Calanca, &amp; Fuhrer,
