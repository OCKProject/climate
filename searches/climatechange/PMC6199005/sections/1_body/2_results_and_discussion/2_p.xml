<p class="p">The results indicate that all case‐studies considered soil degradation, although they all had other primary research objectives (e.g., yields, profitability, and greenhouse gas emissions). This confirms the high awareness of soil degradation issues in agricultural climate change research. In general, the adaptation options under climate change conditions seem to have positive impacts on soils (Table 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Five main groups of agricultural adaptation options could be distinguished: introduction of new crops and crop rotation changes; alteration of the intensity of tillage practices; implementation of irrigation and drainage systems; optimization of fertilization; and change of arable land to grassland or vice versa. The potential soil threats of adaptation options and impacts on soil functions are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. A positive impact (+) indicates reduced soil threats and improved soil functions. A negative impact (−) indicates increased soil degradation risks and decreased soil functions. Due to the aggregation of one to several simultaneously assessed adaptation options, the combined effects on soil functions are provided for each case‐study.
