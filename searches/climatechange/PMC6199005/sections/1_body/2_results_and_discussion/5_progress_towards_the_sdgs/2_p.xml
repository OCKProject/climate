<p class="p">The adaptation options represented in the case‐studies potentially support the achievement of SDGs. Adaptation in most of the case studies likely supports SDGs 2 and 13, whereas the impacts on SDG 15 appear uncertain and depend on the regional context and the choice of adaptation options. Most case‐studies are largely based on modelling and experts' expectations of possible effects of future management and less on measured empirical evidence, which increases uncertainties of soil biodiversity effects due to climate change adaptation. However, with respect to SDGs 2 and 13, several climate change adaptation options are already practised on farms in order to increase resilience to harmful weather events (e.g., Mitter et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>), which increases confidence. For example, some evidence has been found for effects on crop yields and soil functions under conditions of elevated temperatures, rainfall, or extreme events (Peltonen‐Sainio et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which are most likely becoming more frequent due to climate change in some European regions. Other adaptation options, such as more diversified land use at the farm level suggested by Peltonen‐Sainio et al. (
