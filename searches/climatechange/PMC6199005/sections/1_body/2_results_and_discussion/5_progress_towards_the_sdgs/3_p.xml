<p class="p">Although the contribution to SDG 2 through increased food and biomass production in many areas of Europe is in line with other model results on climate change adaptation (Ergon et al.,

 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), less evidence is available to validate findings on the other soil functions, which are more important for SDGs 13 and 15. Further uncertainty results from the huge knowledge gap on the potential and adoption rates of emerging technologies in agriculture and on process interactions between climate change, soil management, and soil functions. Detailed, integrated case‐studies of climate and management changes are required to verify which adaptation options perform best to promote sustainable development in a particular regional context and how their adoption can be supported.
