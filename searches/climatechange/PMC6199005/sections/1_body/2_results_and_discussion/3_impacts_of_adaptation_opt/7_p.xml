<p class="p">Most of the case‐studies reported that the risk of salinity is limited, at least in the medium term, due to their locations in northern and western parts of Europe. Salinity issues are more prominent in the southern and eastern parts of Europe, such as in the Mediterranean climate region (Zalidis, Stamatiadis, Takavakoglou, Eskridge, &amp; Misopolinos,

In the case of the Guadalquivir Valley (ES), increased irrigation using reclaimed wastewater might create environmental problems due to increased soil salinity accumulation. Studies carried out in Almería (southern Spain) showed that irrigation with nutrient enriched disinfected urban wastewater can result in low macronutrient absorption efficiency and high soil salinity (Segura, Contreras París, Plaza, &amp; Lao,
