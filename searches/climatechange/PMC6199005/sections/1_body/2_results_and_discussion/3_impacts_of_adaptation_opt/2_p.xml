<p class="p">The study shows that adaptation options under climate change scenarios reduced SOC losses in 75% of the cases examined (Figure

For example, farmers and extension experts in the North Savo case (FI) are already worried about wet conditions in winter and more frequent heavy rains as well as wet conditions during the harvest periods, which affect crop yields, nutrient leaching, and erosion. In response, modified crop rotations, including the use of deep‐rooted crops (i.e., clover and oilseed), have been proposed by local scientists (Huttunen et al.,

 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). An expert from the region anticipates that these changes may maintain or even improve the SOC levels and water retention. For the case‐study of Foggia (IT), adopting 2‐ or 3‐year crop rotations (based on winter wheat and tomato) under future conditions similar to a climate model realization of the IPCC A2 climate emission scenario led to an increase in SOC by approximately 10% of the SOC content of the current system that is based on continuous wheat (Ventrella et al.,
