<p class="p">Although adaptation options are anticipated to reduce many soil threats in most cases across Europe, there are concerns regarding the likely increase in soil compaction (approximately 40%). Soil compaction is a common problem worldwide. It affects plant root development and reduces water retention capacity; it can also lower crop yields (D'Or &amp; Destain, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). With the increase in total irrigated cropland and more intensive use of agricultural machinery, the risk of soil compaction may increase. For Brandenburg (DE), Gutzler et al. (
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) identified the irrigation of key crops, such as wheat, rye, maize, and sugar beet, as an agricultural adaptation strategy to cope with climate change (e.g., less rainfall in summer and more in winter) and to increase crop productivity. However, irrigation and the use of heavy machinery may increase the risk of soil compaction in the area. Thus, an appropriate use of agricultural machinery (e.g., low pressure and wide tires) is one effective measure against compaction (Prager et al.,

In Flevoland (NL), some farmers are concerned about SOC loss and soil compaction and therefore intend to replace root crops with wheat. However, if they were only interested in profits, the area of root crops such as potatoes would likely increase (Mandryk et al.,
