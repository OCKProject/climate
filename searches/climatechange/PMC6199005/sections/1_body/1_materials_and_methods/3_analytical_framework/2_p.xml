<p class="p">The Driver–Pressure–State–Impact–Response framework was used to study the impacts of climate change adaptation options on the soil functions and SDGs (Figure 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The framework conceptualizes complex sustainability challenges and provides insight into the relationships between the environment and human beings (Gabrielsen &amp; Bosch, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). It links the emergence of climate change (Drivers of change) and its impacts on natural and human systems to decision makers (farmers) who adopt new management practices (Pressures), which can lead to soil threats (State 1) and altered soil functions (State 2). Subsequently, the SDG targets (Impact) can be affected. As a result, policy action (Response) may be required (not covered in the present study). Adaptation options, soil threats, and soil functions are understood as dynamic processes over time, such that the ‘States’ in the Driver–Pressure–State–Impact–Response framework represent dynamic biophysical indicators and human practices.
