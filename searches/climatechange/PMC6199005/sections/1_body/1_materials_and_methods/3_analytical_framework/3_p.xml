<p class="p">Adaptation options can be triggered by climate change. However, in reality, this driver is intertwined with other factors such as market conditions, technological development, farmer perceptions, and policy interventions (Mitter, Schönhart, Larcher, &amp; Schmid, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Techen &amp; Helming, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). All case‐studies assessed climate change adaptation but in different scenario contexts. For the sake of comparability, only those scenarios and adaptation options were included in the review that had been developed from a farming system perspective intended to maintain farm profitability and improve yield level and stability. Other adaptation options focusing primarily on environmental (e.g.,reduced nutrient leaching) and/or social (e.g., employment, health, and culture) objectives (Mandryk, Reidsma, Kanellopoulos, Groot, &amp; van Ittersum, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) were not included. The current situation of management practices and climate conditions is the counterfactual to which scenarios of future climate and management situations were assessed. However, in reality, transition is already occurring, and the adoption of adaptation practices can already be observed at individual farms in some cases (e.g., in North Savo, FI).
