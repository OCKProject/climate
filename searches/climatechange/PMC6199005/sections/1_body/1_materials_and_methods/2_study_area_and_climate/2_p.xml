<p class="p">Climate change adaptation options and resulting soil impacts are likely to be diverse across Europe due to heterogeneous biophysical and socio‐economic production conditions. Additionally, research design likely determines conclusions on adaptation options and their impacts in a region. To tackle both bio‐physical and socio‐economic dimensions, 20 case‐studies across Europe were assessed at the NUTS 2/3 level (Figure 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Each case‐study undertook an integrated assessment with quantitative tools (e.g., scenario modelling) or qualitative, stakeholder inclusive tools or a combination of both. Published results from case‐studies were compiled and further substantiated with information from 23 involved scientists—most of them co‐authors of this article—via a semi‐structured questionnaire (

This led to a unique data set that reflects the impacts of adaptation options on soils across Europe. The 20 case‐studies represent 13 European countries and cover 11 of the 13 major environmental zones of Europe (Metzger, Bunce, Jongman, Mücher, &amp; Watkins, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). This classification represents the environmental heterogeneity of Europe and utilizes European ecological data sets for climate, geomorphology, geology and soil, habitats, and vegetation. The two zones not presented in the sample are Anatolia and Lusitania.
