<p class="p">To classify the case‐studies in terms of soil types, the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (FAO, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) was used. The 20 case‐study areas cover the 15 most common arable soil types of the 32 World Reference Base types (Table 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> also lists the features of climate change scenarios that are relevant to agricultural production, land use and farming systems, methods employed to obtain the results, and key publications for each of the case‐studies. Regarding the assessment methods, most studies (17 out of 20) modelled the effects of alternative adaptation management options under climate change on yields and environmental impacts. Such adaptation options were identified by means of stakeholder interaction with regional farmers or extension services in 14 cases and by researchers in the other cases. Therefore, the adaptation options that were regarded as the most suitable by farmers could be identified. Three case‐studies simulated changing climatic conditions by employing field experiments at different locations for studying adaptation options (e.g., crop rotation and no tillage).
