<p class="p">Soils provide numerous functions to society. The European Commission (
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) lists seven key functions: 
 <italic class="italic">food and biomass production</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">storing</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">filtering, transforming</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">and recycling water and nutrients</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">habitat and gene pool</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">SOC pool</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">providing raw materials</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">serving as physical and cultural environment for mankind</italic>; and 
 <italic class="italic">storing the geological and archaeological heritage</italic>. In this study, focus was laid on the first four functions (Table 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), which are most relevant to agricultural land use (Schulte et al., 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The concept of soil functions was introduced in the Thematic Strategy for Soil Protection (European Commission, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), although it has not resulted in a legal implementation of soil conservation measures. Soil functions connect the physical, chemical, and biological processes in the soil system with the provision of benefits to society (Glæsner, Helming, &amp; de Vries, 
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Agricultural management affects the performance of soil functions in close interaction with geophysical site conditions. The optimization of one of the functions is often to the disadvantage of others. The assessment presents aggregated impacts of one to several adaptation options on soil threats and functions (Table
