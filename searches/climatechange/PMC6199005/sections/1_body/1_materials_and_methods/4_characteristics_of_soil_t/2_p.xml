<p class="p">The European Commission's (
 <xref rid="ldr3006-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>) report lists seven major threats that cause soil degradation in Europe: 
 <italic class="italic">soil erosion</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">decline in SOC</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">compaction</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">decline in soil biodiversity</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">salinization</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">contamination</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">sealing</italic>. Because the study focuses on agricultural soil management, only the first five soil threats were considered. Soil contamination and soil sealing were excluded because the first is by definition associated with industrial, mainly point‚Äêsource pollution, whereas the latter refers to taking land out of production (European Commission,
