<p class="p">This present study therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of temperature, salinity and the combination of both factors on settlement and post-settlement phases of 
 <italic class="italic">Platygyra acuta</italic>, a dominant broadcast-spawning coral in Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This massive scleractinian coral is of high ecological significance and functions as an important reef-builder that shapes the coral community structure in Hong Kong and nearby regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Experimental evidences suggest that early life stages of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> from Hong Kong are tolerant to environmental stresses. Examples of these include the high tolerance of fertilization, larval survival, motility, settlement and growth to heavy metal and elevated temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], of fertilization, embryonic development, larval survival, motility and settlement to inorganic nutrients [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], and high tolerance of fertilization success and embryonic development to reduced salinity and elevated temperature [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. However, the effects of salinity and temperature stresses on later stages (i.e., settlement, post-settlement survival and early growth) of the corals have not been thoroughly examined. As Hong Kong is a marginal area for coral growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], understanding the responses of Hong Kong corals to environmental change should be of particular significance to the future fate of corals and coral reefs. The extent to which recruitment stages of the dominant species from this region can withstand the interactive effect of temperature and salinity changes points to the potential for this species to persist under a warmer and intermittently less saline future ocean.
