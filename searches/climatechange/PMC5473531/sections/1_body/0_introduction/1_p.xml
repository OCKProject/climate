<p class="p">Coral populations worldwide are currently facing threats from global climate changes to which they will have to acclimatize, adapt, migrate, or else become extinct [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. While growing attention has focused on the “escape” potential of corals from tropical reefs into temperature refugia, i.e. areas that are currently marginal for coral growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], the importance of coral communities that are already present in these marginal areas is also increasingly being recognized. It has been suggested that corals in marginal areas may already be well acclimatized to marginal growing conditions by experience-mediated tolerances [

On the other hand, these corals could have become genetically well adapted to marginal conditions as a result of selection and evolution of different parental lineages and genotypic characters over generations of exposure to environmental extremes [
