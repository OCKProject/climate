 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Such a complex interplay of tolerance often makes the consequences of environmental changes unpredictable. Significant research efforts have already been extended to evaluate the independent effects of temperature and salinity on early life stages of coral. However, as lowering of salinity would be associated with elevated temperature under global climate change, more focus is needed on the interactive effects of temperature and salinity change if their impacts on corals are to be assessed more realistically.
