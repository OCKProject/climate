<p class="p">Successful sexual recruitment of corals represents an essential process in maintaining coral communities and in facilitating the recovery of coral populations following disturbances [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. It is therefore important to understand how present and future combinations of environmental stresses may affect any stage (e.g. settlement and post-settlement) of coral recruitment success, especially for corals that are currently present in the marginal areas. Such information is important to better assess the response and possible roles of marginal coral communities in the future under climate change.
