<p class="p">Mean sea surface temperature (SST) is projected to increase from 2.6 to 4.8°C by 2100 as a result of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that increased SST can impact numerous biological and physiological processes of early life stages of corals, including fertilization success [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. However, temperature will not be the only environmental factor affected by global climate change. A future increase in the frequency of monsoonal extremes in precipitation is also projected with rising SST [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Heavy rainfall will likely increase the risk of reduced salinity in near shore waters. Although the effects of temperature stress on the early life stages of coral have been relatively well explored, there is a paucity of data on the effects of salinity stress on these crucial stages [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The few studies that quantified the impact of lowered salinity on corals pointed to relatively comparable effects, including reduced fertilization success [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], increased developmental abnormality [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], and increased pre- and post-settlement mortality [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Given that mass spawning events have been reported to occur during the start of monsoon season in many localities (e.g. in Guam, Okinawa [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]), responses of coral recruitment stages to low salinity levels are ecologically relevant and likely to be critical to the persistence of coastal coral populations.
