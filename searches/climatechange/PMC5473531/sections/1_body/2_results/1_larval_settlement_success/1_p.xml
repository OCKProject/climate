<p class="p">Larval settlement was recorded under all temperature and salinity treatments over the experimental period except at 14 psu, where settlement only occurred under ambient (27°C) temperature (

Under ambient and elevated temperatures (30, 32°C), the majority of the larvae (&gt; 80% of total larval settlement) settled in the first two days of the experiment. Within the same time interval, however, the settlement rate was lower (&lt; 60%) under the lowest temperature (24°C) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179423.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), the total percentage of larval settlement remained consistently high, from 76.4 ± 2.8%, 69.1 ± 3.6% to 66.7 ± 4.4% (mean ± SE) under 32, 30 and 27°C respectively. This significantly declined to 32.1 ± 4.0% under the lowest temperature of 24°C (Pairwise comparisons,
