<p class="p">The size of recruits 10 days after settlement was also affected by temperature and salinity (Two-way ANOVA, P &lt; 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179423.t001" class="xref">Table 1C</xref>). Slightly elevated temperature (30°C) exerted no significant effect on the size of recruits under all salinity levels. However, significantly smaller size of recruits was detected under elevated (32°C) temperature at all salinity levels, except at 18 psu. Lowered temperature significantly reduced the size of recruits under 30 and 26 psu (Tukey-HSD tests,
