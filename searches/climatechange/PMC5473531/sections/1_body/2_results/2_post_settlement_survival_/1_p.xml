<p class="p">Results of Mixed ANOVA (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179423.t001" class="xref">Table 1B</xref>) revealed that post-settlement survival of coral recruits was significantly affected by temperature (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Post-settlement survival over the 54 days of monitoring was consistently high (&gt; 94%) across all temperature levels at ambient salinity (33 psu; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179423.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). No mortality of recruits was observed under 27°C; 97.9 ± 2.1%, 97.5 ± 2.5% and 94.6 ± 1.9% (mean ± SE) of the recruits survived under 24, 30 and 32°C respectively. The effect of either lower or higher temperature only began to be detected at lower salinities. Hence, when salinity decreased to 26 psu and below, the percentage of post-settlement survival at ambient 27°C and the elevated temperature of 30°C was always higher than at 24°C, followed by 32°C (Tukey-HSD test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05, (27 = 30) &gt; 24 &gt; 32°C). Statistics tests on post-settlement survival were not performed for 30 psu and 26 psu treatments at 24°C due to insufficient replicates. Unusually high mortality of recruits under these treatments was recorded, and was likely to be caused by some other external factors, e.g. infectious diseases. Nonetheless, the patterns of post-settlement survival under these two treatments appeared not to be significantly different from those under ambient salinity, at least up to Day 44 of the experiment.
