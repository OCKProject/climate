<p class="p">A major finding of this study is the positive effect of elevated temperature (+3 and +5째C ambient) on larval settlement under reduced salinity level (26 psu). Generally, signs of stress were revealed at reduced salinity of 26 psu under ambient temperature, with a significant decline in settlement success. However, similar decline in settlement success first became noticeable only at much lower salinity (22 psu) under elevated temperatures. This was followed by high post-settlement survival for up to 44 days and 8 days under +3째C and +5째C ambient respectively. This observation is significant as it points not only to the importance of understanding the interactive effects of multiple factors but also the importance of duration of exposure to these effects when evaluating the potential consequences of global climate changes on future coral sustainability. The reasons for this mitigation role of elevated temperature remain unclear. Given that mortality of settled coral larvae was generally reduced compared to swimming larvae [
