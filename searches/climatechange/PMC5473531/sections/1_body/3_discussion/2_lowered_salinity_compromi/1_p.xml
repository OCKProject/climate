<p class="p">In general, as salinity was reduced, successful larval settlement also significantly decreased. This was observed in previous studies on

 <italic class="italic">Orbicella faceolata</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. These variable susceptibilities of corals to salinity stress could be related to different tolerances of coral species [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Moreover, it is plausible that local ambient conditions to which the parent colonies are exposed may also influence the response of their offspring [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. These corals may be in different states of acclimatization and adaptation to salinity stresses, particularly in regions that are frequently exposed to low salinity.
