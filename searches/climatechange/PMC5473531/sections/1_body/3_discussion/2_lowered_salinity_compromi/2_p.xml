<p class="p">In the present study, larval settlement at ambient 33 psu and 30 psu remained high (&gt;66%) under ambient temperature. Although settlement success decreased when salinity was reduced to 26 and 22 psu, the settlement rates were still above 40%. This suggests that

Further study is needed to verify the extent to which prolonged exposure to reduced salinity will affect the subsequent settlement success of different early-developmental stages of corals.
