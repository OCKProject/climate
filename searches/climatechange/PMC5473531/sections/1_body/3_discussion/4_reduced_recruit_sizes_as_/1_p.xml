 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. They must rely on their lipid reserves to generate energy for settlement and to form their first skeleton [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Differences in early recruit sizes may therefore be a good indicator to reveal the energetic cost of coping with temperature and salinity stresses. The observed significantly smaller sizes of recruits under lowered salinity levels, lowered (-3°C ambient) and elevated temperatures (+5°C ambient) are consistent with the hypothesis that resources are more rapidly used up in these corals to cope with environmental stresses than to sustain metamorphosis and calcification [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Reduced size can also reduce competitive ability and increase the risk of post-settlement mortality [
