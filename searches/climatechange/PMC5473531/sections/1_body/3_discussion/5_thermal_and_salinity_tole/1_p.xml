 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Possible reasons for the relatively high thermal tolerance of corals may be related to a large annual range of mean seawater temperature in Hong Kong, from 16°C in winter to 30°C in summer [

 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The high thermal tolerance in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> in the present study appeared to support this hypothesis. However, the strong tolerance to +5°C ambient (+2°C of summer maxima) in settlement and post-settlement survival for up to 56 days of exposure was unexpected, as this temperature is much higher than what the adult colonies may experience throughout the year.
