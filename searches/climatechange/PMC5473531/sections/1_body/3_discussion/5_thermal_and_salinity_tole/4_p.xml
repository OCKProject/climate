<p class="p">In summary, the results of this study suggest that the combination of predicted elevated temperature and the potential episodes of prolonged lowered salinity over the next century [

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> is one of the most dominant scleractinian coral species in marginal environments, such as Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Further research is necessary to determine whether similar tolerances of the early life stages are shared among other corals in Hong Kong and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Other physical and biological factors may be considered in these studies, including the influence of symbionts on settlement, post-settlement survival and recruit growth rate. These coral species have long pre-empted the space and shaped the community structure in these non-reefal communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. If they are unlikely to be significantly affected by climate change in the near future, the communities dominated by them will likely persist and have important roles to play in maintaining the survival of worldâ€™s coral reefs in a warmer and potentially less saline future ocean.
