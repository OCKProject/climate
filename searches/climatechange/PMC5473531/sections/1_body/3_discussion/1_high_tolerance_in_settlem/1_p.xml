 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> may not be as serious as that generally reported or projected in the literature for other tropical coral species. Settlement and post-settlement survivorship of this species were robust to elevated temperature change within the range examined in the present experiments. Although there was an apparent trend of increasing settlement from ambient 27°C (66%) to elevated temperatures of 30°C (+3°C ambient, 69%) and 32°C (+5°C ambient, 76%), the difference was not statistically significant. However, a step-wise response was observed in the lowered temperature of 24°C (-3°C ambient), with a significant drop in settlement to 32%. The settlement monitoring lasted for eight days and the majority of the larvae settled within the first two days of the experiments.
