<p class="p">There is limited research that has monitored post-settlement survival of corals. Among the aforementioned studies, the longest post-settlement monitoring was conducted by Nozawa and Harrison [

 <italic class="italic">acuta</italic> recruits to up to +5°C above ambient (i.e. 32°C) under ambient salinity (33 psu) for 56 days did not appear to cause any significant failure in settlement and post-settlement survival. This coral species is by far the first to show such high tolerance of its recruits to such a high level of elevated temperature (+5°C ambient) for up to 56 days of exposure, compared to those reported in the literature [
