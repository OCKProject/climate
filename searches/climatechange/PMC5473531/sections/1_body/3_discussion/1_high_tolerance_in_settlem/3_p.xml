<p class="p">There are two exceptional cases reporting positive effects of elevated temperature exceeding +3°C ambient on coral settlement. The brooding species, 
 <italic class="italic">Porites astreoids</italic>, for example, increased settlement rates at 33°C (+5°C ambient [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). However, since no settlement under control conditions was reported in that study, this positive effect may be an artifact of insufficient settlement cues, as no conditioned tiles or crustose coralline algae were provided during the settlement assay. On the other hand, Nozawa and Harrison [
 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] also reported a significant increase of 9.2% in settlement at 29°C (+6°C ambient) in 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora solitaryensis</italic> after 24h of exposure. However, the positive effect was followed by a 90% post-settlement mortality by Day 5. This points to the importance of studying post-settlement survival in order to reveal the true effects of elevated temperature on future coral sustainability.
