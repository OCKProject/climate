<p class="p">All statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS version 19.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., USA). All results are given as mean ± standard error. Proportional data were arcsine transformed and tested for normality using One-Sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and for homogeneity of variances using Levene’s test. A two-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) was then used to evaluate significant differences (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05) of the combined effects of seawater temperature and salinity on the percentage of larvae that settled and the size of recruits. Mixed ANOVA was used to assess the combined effects of seawater temperature, salinity and duration of exposure on post-settlement survival of coral recruits. Post hoc comparisons of means for significant factors in the ANOVAs were carried out using the Tukey Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test where appropriate. Pairwise comparisons were used to compare the treatment effects of salinity alone at each level of temperature on cumulative percentage of surviving settler and overall post-settlement success. Bonferroni correction to the
