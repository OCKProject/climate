 <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Briefly, the collected egg-sperm bundles from different colonies were mixed in a fertilization tank and left for an hour to allow for fertilization. Subsequently, the fertilized eggs (embryos) were washed three times to remove excess sperm before being allocated in different culture containers with 40 μm filtered seawater (FSW). The embryos and the resulting lecithotrophic (i.e., energy-limited) larvae were reared at a density of around 0.5 individual/ml. Seawater was changed every day to keep the larvae healthy until being transferred to the Marine Science Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, four days after spawning. Larvae brought back were maintained in culture containers filled with freshly prepared 40 μm FSW until the experiment.
