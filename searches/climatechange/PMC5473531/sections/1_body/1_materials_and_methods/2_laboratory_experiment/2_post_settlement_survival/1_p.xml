<p class="p">Post-settlement survival of recruits was also recorded during the settlement experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179423.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). After eight days of treatment exposure, non-settled larvae were removed. Larvae that settled on the tiles were further monitored every 12 days in the subsequent 48 days, from mid June to early August, under the dissecting microscope for post-settlement survival. Seawater in each beaker was changed every 2–3 days, as described above. Average (± SD) temperature of the water baths during the experimental period was recorded to be 24.1 ± 0.5°C, 27.1 ± 0.5°C, 30.7 ± 0.7°C and 32.7 ± 0.7°C respectively for the four temperature treatments.
