<p class="p">The sizes of the post-settled coral recruits were determined by measuring their surface area 10 days after settlement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179423.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Only recruits that were marked to have settled since the first two days of the settlement monitoring period were measured to avoid difference in sizes resulting from age difference of these recruits. The cross-sectional area of each individual settled on the horizontal surface was calculated using the image analysis program Image-ProÂ® Plus 6.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., USA). Individuals that settled on the sides of the tile grooves or exhibited partial or full mortality were excluded from the analysis.
