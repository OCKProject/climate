<p class="p">The desired salinity level was prepared by diluting 0.22 μm FSW with a volume of milli-Q water. Diluted natural seawater was used, rather than artificial seawater, to simulate as closely as possible dilution of seawater by rainfall or underground seepages under natural conditions [

The number of metamorphosed larvae was counted under a dissecting microscope and their locations on the settlement tile were mapped. Metamorphosis was assessed as the percentage of larvae that attached onto the settlement tiles and formed flattened disks of tissue or single polyps. Seawater in each beaker was changed every 48 h with the seawater being pre-conditioned to the specific temperature for each treatment accordingly. Much care was taken not to disturb the larvae during replacement of freshly prepared seawater.
