However, more focus should be placed on the interactive effects of multiple stressors if their impacts upon corals are to be assessed more realistically. Elevation of sea surface temperature is projected under global climate change, and future increases in precipitation extremes related to the monsoon are also expected. Thus, the lowering of salinity could become a more common phenomenon and its impact on corals could be significant as extreme precipitation usually occurs during the coral spawning season. Here, we investigated the interactive effects of temperature [24, 27 (ambient), 30, 32&#x000b0;C] and salinity [33 psu (ambient), 30, 26, 22, 18, 14 psu] on larval settlement, post-settlement survival and early growth of the dominant coral <italic>Platygyra acuta</italic> from Hong Kong, a marginal environment for coral growth. The results indicate that elevated temperatures (+3&#x000b0;C and +5&#x000b0;C above ambient) did not have any significant effects on larval settlement success and post-settlement survival for up to 56 days of prolonged exposure. Such thermal tolerance was markedly higher than that reported in the literature for other coral species. Moreover, there was a positive effect of these elevated temperatures in reducing the negative effects of lowered salinity (26 psu) on settlement success. The enhanced settlement success brought about by elevated temperatures, together with the high post-settlement survival recorded up to 44 and 8 days of exposure under +3&#x000b0;C and +5&#x000b0;C ambient respectively, resulted in the overall positive effects of elevated temperatures on recruitment success. These results suggest that projected elevation in temperature over the next century should not pose any major problem for the recruitment success of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic>. The combined effects of higher temperatures and lowered salinity (26 psu) could even be beneficial. Therefore, corals that are currently present in marginal environments like Hong Kong, as exemplified by the dominant <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic>, are likely to persist in a warmer and intermittently less saline, future ocean.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 460013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Put</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution>Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund</institution></funding-source><award-id>No. 14122215</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ang</surname><given-names>Put</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by Hong Kong Research Grant Council General Research Fund No. 460013 and No. 14122215, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/cergprod/scrrm00541.jsp">https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/cergprod/scrrm00541.jsp</ext-link>.

While growing attention has focused on the &#x0201c;escape&#x0201d; potential of corals from tropical reefs into temperature refugia, i.e. areas that are currently marginal for coral growth [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], the importance of coral communities that are already present in these marginal areas is also increasingly being recognized. It has been suggested that corals in marginal areas may already be well acclimatized to marginal growing conditions by experience-mediated tolerances [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, these corals could have become genetically well adapted to marginal conditions as a result of selection and evolution of different parental lineages and genotypic characters over generations of exposure to environmental extremes [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Successful sexual recruitment of corals represents an essential process in maintaining coral communities and in facilitating the recovery of coral populations following disturbances [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. It is a process that is crucial to coral reef resilience and may also be a bottleneck for the success of coral species in the future [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. It is therefore important to understand how present and future combinations of environmental stresses may affect any stage (e.g. settlement and post-settlement) of coral recruitment success, especially for corals that are currently present in the marginal areas. Such information is important to better assess the response and possible roles of marginal coral communities in the future under climate change.</p><p>Mean sea surface temperature (SST) is projected to increase from 2.6 to 4.8&#x000b0;C by 2100 as a result of climate change [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Mounting experimental evidence suggests that increased SST can impact numerous biological and physiological processes of early life stages of corals, including fertilization success [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], embryonic development [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; larval survival [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], settlement [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and post-settlement survival [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, temperature will not be the only environmental factor affected by global climate change. A future increase in the frequency of monsoonal extremes in precipitation is also projected with rising SST [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Heavy rainfall will likely increase the risk of reduced salinity in near shore waters. Although the effects of temperature stress on the early life stages of coral have been relatively well explored, there is a paucity of data on the effects of salinity stress on these crucial stages [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The few studies that quantified the impact of lowered salinity on corals pointed to relatively comparable effects, including reduced fertilization success [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], increased developmental abnormality [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and increased pre- and post-settlement mortality [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Given that mass spawning events have been reported to occur during the start of monsoon season in many localities (e.g. in Guam, Okinawa [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], French Polynesia [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]), responses of coral recruitment stages to low salinity levels are ecologically relevant and likely to be critical to the persistence of coastal coral populations.</p><p>Responses to multiple stressors are more complex than those elicited under single stress scenarios, and often present an entirely new perspective on the capacity of organisms to respond [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. For example, lowered salinity increases the abnormal embryonic development of coral [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; lowered temperature exacerbates this increase (synergistic effect) [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] whereas elevated temperature reverses it (antagonistic effect) [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Such a complex interplay of tolerance often makes the consequences of environmental changes unpredictable. Significant research efforts have already been extended to evaluate the independent effects of temperature and salinity on early life stages of coral. However, as lowering of salinity would be associated with elevated temperature under global climate change, more focus is needed on the interactive effects of temperature and salinity change if their impacts on corals are to be assessed more realistically.</p><p>This present study therefore aimed to evaluate the effects of temperature, salinity and the combination of both factors on settlement and post-settlement phases of <italic>Platygyra acuta</italic>, a dominant broadcast-spawning coral in Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This massive scleractinian coral is of high ecological significance and functions as an important reef-builder that shapes the coral community structure in Hong Kong and nearby regions [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Experimental evidences suggest that early life stages of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> from Hong Kong are tolerant to environmental stresses. Examples of these include the high tolerance of fertilization, larval survival, motility, settlement and growth to heavy metal and elevated temperature [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], of fertilization, embryonic development, larval survival, motility and settlement to inorganic nutrients [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and high tolerance of fertilization success and embryonic development to reduced salinity and elevated temperature [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the effects of salinity and temperature stresses on later stages (i.e., settlement, post-settlement survival and early growth) of the corals have not been thoroughly examined. As Hong Kong is a marginal area for coral growth [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], understanding the responses of Hong Kong corals to environmental change should be of particular significance to the future fate of corals and coral reefs. The extent to which recruitment stages of the dominant species from this region can withstand the interactive effect of temperature and salinity changes points to the potential for this species to persist under a warmer and intermittently less saline future ocean.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Spawning and collection of gametes</title><p>This study was conducted in A Ye Wan (AYW), one of the coral core areas in Tung Ping Chau Marine Park (TPCMP) (22<sup>o</sup>32&#x02019;N, 114<sup>o</sup>25&#x02019;E), Hong Kong, with permission from the Marine Parks Division of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong SAR Government.

Experimental design followed those described in Chui and Ang [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Briefly, a factorial experimental design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179423.g001">Fig 1</xref>) was employed with four levels of temperature (24, ambient 27, 30, 32&#x000b0;C) and six levels of salinity (ambient 33, 30, 26, 22, 18, 14 psu). The temperature range used encompasses current and future projected temperature conditions under global climate change. Temperature of 27&#x000b0;C is the mean ambient temperature of the spawning months in Hong Kong, whereas elevated temperature represents the average summer maximum in the study site (+3&#x000b0;C, i.e. 30&#x000b0;C) as well as an estimated increase in SST by 2100 (+5&#x000b0;C, i.e. 32&#x000b0;C) [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. All water baths were regulated with chiller and heater to minimize daily temperature fluctuation. HOBO Temperature Pendant data loggers (Onset) were deployed in the water baths to record temperature at 30-min intervals. The levels of salinity employed also represented some realistic ranges recorded in Hong Kong waters. Low salinity ranges are usually recorded in western waters of Hong Kong where the influence of the Pearl River discharge is significant. Low salinity could also be recorded in eastern waters where most corals are found. For example, on May 2014, salinity of 26 psu persisted for more than a day throughout the coastal water column in the study area due to continuous discharge of underground seepage after a heavy downpour [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These low salinity ranges therefore represent potential scenarios that could be encountered by corals in Hong Kong.</p><fig id="pone.0179423.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0179423.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Schematic representation of the experimental design to study the interactive effects of temperature and salinity change on <italic>Platygyra acuta</italic> larvae.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0179423.g001"/></fig><p>The desired salinity level was prepared by diluting 0.22 &#x003bc;m FSW with a volume of milli-Q water.

The number of metamorphosed larvae was counted under a dissecting microscope and their locations on the settlement tile were mapped.

This points to the importance of studying post-settlement survival in order to reveal the true effects of elevated temperature on future coral sustainability.</p><p>There is limited research that has monitored post-settlement survival of corals. Among the aforementioned studies, the longest post-settlement monitoring was conducted by Nozawa and Harrison [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] which showed no significant difference in mean mortality of settled <italic>Platygyra daedalea</italic> recruits exposed to 27&#x000b0;C (ambient) and 29&#x000b0;C (+2&#x000b0;C ambient) for 66 days. In our present study, exposure of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> recruits to up to +5&#x000b0;C above ambient (i.e. 32&#x000b0;C) under ambient salinity (33 psu) for 56 days did not appear to cause any significant failure in settlement and post-settlement survival. This coral species is by far the first to show such high tolerance of its recruits to such a high level of elevated temperature (+5&#x000b0;C ambient) for up to 56 days of exposure, compared to those reported in the literature [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec015"><title>Lowered salinity compromises coral settlement success</title><p>In general, as salinity was reduced, successful larval settlement also significantly decreased. This was observed in previous studies on <italic>Acropora hyacinthus</italic>, <italic>Favites abdita</italic>, <italic>Platygyra daedalea</italic> and <italic>P</italic>. <italic>sinensis</italic>, where successful settlement of larvae decreased with reduced salinity from 32 psu ambient to 28 psu [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, no effect of reduced salinity (36 psu ambient to 28 psu) on settlement was reported in <italic>Orbicella faceolata</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These variable susceptibilities of corals to salinity stress could be related to different tolerances of coral species [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Moreover, it is plausible that local ambient conditions to which the parent colonies are exposed may also influence the response of their offspring [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These corals may be in different states of acclimatization and adaptation to salinity stresses, particularly in regions that are frequently exposed to low salinity.</p><p>In the present study, larval settlement at ambient 33 psu and 30 psu remained high (&#x0003e;66%) under ambient temperature. Although settlement success decreased when salinity was reduced to 26 and 22 psu, the settlement rates were still above 40%. This suggests that <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> from Hong Kong may also be one of the most tolerant species to settle in some of the lowest salinity levels, compared to literature reports [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. It is important to note, however, that salinity exposure in the present study was initiated only after the coral larvae became competent (around Day 6). This differs from earlier studies by both Vermeij et al. [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and True [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] in which salinity treatments were carried out earlier during gamete stages. Further study is needed to verify the extent to which prolonged exposure to reduced salinity will affect the subsequent settlement success of different early-developmental stages of corals.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Positive effect of elevated temperatures (+3 and +5&#x000b0;C ambient) in enhancing larval settlement success under lower salinity (26 psu)</title><p>A major finding of this study is the positive effect of elevated temperature (+3 and +5&#x000b0;C ambient) on larval settlement under reduced salinity level (26 psu). Generally, signs of stress were revealed at reduced salinity of 26 psu under ambient temperature, with a significant decline in settlement success. However, similar decline in settlement success first became noticeable only at much lower salinity (22 psu) under elevated temperatures. This was followed by high post-settlement survival for up to 44 days and 8 days under +3&#x000b0;C and +5&#x000b0;C ambient respectively. This observation is significant as it points not only to the importance of understanding the interactive effects of multiple factors but also the importance of duration of exposure to these effects when evaluating the potential consequences of global climate changes on future coral sustainability. The reasons for this mitigation role of elevated temperature remain unclear. Given that mortality of settled coral larvae was generally reduced compared to swimming larvae [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], such increases in coral larval settlement success under stressful conditions may be an escape mechanism [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. A similar protective effect of elevated temperature (+3&#x000b0;C ambient) has also been reported to enhance normal development of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> embryos under lowered salinity (26 psu) [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Reduced recruit sizes as an indicator of energetic cost to cope with temperature and salinity stresses</title><p>The majority of coral species, like <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic>, have azooxanthellate larvae that do not acquire symbionts in their pre-settlement stages [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. They must rely on their lipid reserves to generate energy for settlement and to form their first skeleton [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Differences in early recruit sizes may therefore be a good indicator to reveal the energetic cost of coping with temperature and salinity stresses. The observed significantly smaller sizes of recruits under lowered salinity levels, lowered (-3&#x000b0;C ambient) and elevated temperatures (+5&#x000b0;C ambient) are consistent with the hypothesis that resources are more rapidly used up in these corals to cope with environmental stresses than to sustain metamorphosis and calcification [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Reduced size can also reduce competitive ability and increase the risk of post-settlement mortality [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Thermal and salinity tolerances of <italic>Platygyra acuta</italic></title><p>Elevated temperatures of +3 and +5&#x000b0;C ambient did not cause any negative effect on settlement and post-settlement survival in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> over 56 days of prolonged exposure, making this the most tolerant coral species recorded so far in literature. These findings agree with previous studies on the early life stages of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> from Hong Kong, which have suggested their high tolerance to environmental extremes [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Possible reasons for the relatively high thermal tolerance of corals may be related to a large annual range of mean seawater temperature in Hong Kong, from 16&#x000b0;C in winter to 30&#x000b0;C in summer [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Corals may have already been well acclimatized/adapted to temperature perturbation through phenotypic plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] or different parental lineage and genotypic characters that have been selected and evolved over years [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Range of temperature variation has also been suggested to contribute to latitudinal difference in thermal thresholds in coral fertilization and development [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. These studies provide evidence suggesting there is a lower thermal threshold of coral early life stages at lower latitude tropics than at higher latitude subtropics [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. The high thermal tolerance in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> in the present study appeared to support this hypothesis. However, the strong tolerance to +5&#x000b0;C ambient (+2&#x000b0;C of summer maxima) in settlement and post-settlement survival for up to 56 days of exposure was unexpected, as this temperature is much higher than what the adult colonies may experience throughout the year.</p><p>In addition, corals in Hong Kong are mainly found in shallow water regions, from 0 to -3 m CD. They are therefore routinely subjected to salinity effects due to storms and heavy rainfall during wet seasons [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. High tolerance to salinity stress may thus be a result of acclimatization or adaptation due to long history of exposure [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Further research is necessary to look into details of genetic difference [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and the cell-mediated response in individual coral colonies using gene/protein expression profiling [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0179423.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] to reveal the possible underlying mechanisms behind such high thermal tolerance as well as tolerances to other stresses like low salinity. Susceptibility of other coral species, such as <italic>Acropora</italic> spp., at the same study site should also be examined to test whether such level of tolerance is due to the coral species itself or is an adaptive character shared among corals in Hong Kong in response to similar environmental conditions.</p><p>In summary, the results of this study suggest that the combination of predicted elevated temperature and the potential episodes of prolonged lowered salinity over the next century [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], may not pose major problems for the recruitment success of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic>. The combined effect may even be beneficial in certain scenarios, given that the exposure duration is within the tolerance ranges of the coral. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>acuta</italic> is one of the most dominant scleractinian coral species in marginal environments, such as Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Further research is necessary to determine whether similar tolerances of the early life stages are shared among other corals in Hong Kong and to identify the underlying mechanisms. Other physical and biological factors may be considered in these studies, including the influence of symbionts on settlement, post-settlement survival and recruit growth rate. These coral species have long pre-empted the space and shaped the community structure in these non-reefal communities [<xref rid="pone.0179423.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. If they are unlikely to be significantly affected by climate change in the near future, the communities dominated by them will likely persist and have important roles to play in maintaining the survival of world&#x02019;s coral reefs in a warmer and potentially less saline future ocean.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Marine Parks Division of Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong SAR Government for permission to work in Tung Ping Chau Marine Park.
