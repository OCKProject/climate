<p id="Par52" class="p">Climate change affects mental health in a variety of direct, indirect, and overarching pathways—disproportionately affecting those most marginalized. The mental health implications of climate change can result in mental problems and illness as well as affirmative psychosocial outcomes. While the timing and triggers associated with climate change and mental health may vary, making it challenging to establish the manifold links between climate change and mental health, the opportunities of attributing mental health to climate change support climate mitigation as well as mental health action and psychosocial resiliency. Global commitments, like the Paris Accord, the SDGs, and the Sendai Framework are needed to help advance global mental health and climate action; however, coordination amongst these commitments is required—as are concrete actions on behalf of health practitioners—if the issue of mental health and a changing climate is to be efficiently and holistically addressed. Further, a reckoning with social, environmental, and climate injustice is needed if actions to address climate change and mental health are to be rooted in health equity. Transformative action—where inequities are addressed, active hope is demonstrated, and communities are mobilized—is the defining opportunity of the twenty-first century to address the climate change impacts on mental health.</p>
