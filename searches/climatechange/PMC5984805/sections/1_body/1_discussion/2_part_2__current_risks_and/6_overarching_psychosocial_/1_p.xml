 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Since early 2007, environmental philosopher Glenn Albrecht and colleagues have taken note of emotional distress related to the awareness of the overarching problem humans face as a result of global climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. Albrecht et al. suggest that this awareness contributes to ‘psychoterratic syndromes’. Psychoterratic syndromes include phenomena such as ‘ecoanxiety’, ‘ecoparalysis’, and ‘solastalgia’. ‘Ecoanxiety’ refers to the anxiety people face from constantly being surrounded by the wicked and threatening problems associated with a changing climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>]. ‘Ecoparalysis’ refers to the complex feelings of not being able to take effective action to significantly mitigate climate change risks. ‘Solastalgia’ refers to “the distress and isolation caused by the gradual removal of solace from the present state of one’s home environment” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. The term ‘solastalgia’ is also commonly referred to throughout much of the literature on climate change and mental health to articulate the feelings associated with displacement following a climate change-related extreme weather event [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. This new vocabulary provides the language to explore some of the broader mental health implications of escalating climate change risks.
