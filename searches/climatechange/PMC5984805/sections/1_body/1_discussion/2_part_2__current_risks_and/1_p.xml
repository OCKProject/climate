<p id="Par24" class="p">It is challenging for people to recognise changes in climate because these changes appear distant or abstract—especially because climate is often confused or lost in perceptions about weather or seasonal change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. The influential sociologist Anthony Giddens refers to this space and time distancing of the climate change problem as the Giddens Paradox [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. The Giddens Paradox states that: “since the dangers posed by global warming aren’t tangible, immediate or visible in the course of day-to-day life, many will sit on their hands and do nothing of a concrete nature about them. Yet waiting until such dangers become visible and acute—in the shape of catastrophes that are irrefutably the result of climate change—before being stirred to serious action will be too late” (p. 2). Marshall contends that part of the time and space distancing of the climate change problem, and thus the reluctance to act, is reinforced by the Western political discourse on climate change as a future-facing problem that intentionally overlooks the centuries of industrialization, fossil fuel consumption, and land degradation that contribute to anthropogenic climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Marshall calls for a reckoning with this discourse by noting:

  <p id="Par25" class="p">“Climate change is a future problem. But it is also a past problem and a present problem. It is better thought of as a developing process of long-term deterioration, called, by some psychologists, a “creeping problem.” The lack of a definite beginning, end, or deadline requires that we create our own timeline. Not surprisingly, we do so in ways that remove the compulsion to act. We allow just enough history to make it seem familiar but not enough to create a responsibility for our past emissions. We make it just current enough to accept that we need to do something about it but put it just too far in the future to require immediate action” [
