<p id="Par32" class="p">The indirect mental health consequences of climate change can occur as a result of damages to physical and social infrastructure, physical health effects, food and water shortages, conflict, and displacement from acute, subacute, and chronic climactic changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. One of the most well-documented climate hazards that indirectly influences mental health is drought. Long-term droughts affect food and water supplies and can subsequently affect the economic and mental wellbeing of land-based workers, most often impacting those living in rural and remote communities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>]. In a systematic review of the literature, authors note the most prominent causal pathway linking drought and mental health is via the economic effects from land degradation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. These effects are most prominent amongst farmers whose economic livelihoods depend on environmental conditions. Exemplifying this, a 2008 study in New South Wales, Australia reports that nearly three quarters of farmers report stress related to persistent drought [
