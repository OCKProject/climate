<p id="Par12" class="p">The lack of attention to the topic of climate change and mental health is often imputed to the challenges of attribution. Attribution in this case is the scientific association between greenhouse gas emissions and meteorological change on the one hand, and between climate change-related meteorological change and mental health effects on the other. There is now an increasingly strong body of literature which highlights the causal linkages between climate change and extreme weather events (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]). One of the key messages within this literature is that while we cannot say with certainty that any one specific extreme weather event is directly caused by climate change; we do know that because of climate change, extreme weather is more generally on the rise, making extreme weather events more frequent, intense, and complex. In other words, climate change therefore ‘loads the dice’ for more weather extremes.
