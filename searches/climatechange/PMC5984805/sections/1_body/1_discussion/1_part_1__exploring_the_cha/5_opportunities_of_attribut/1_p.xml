<p id="Par20" class="p">It is important to locate climate change within the discourse on mental health because the frequency, intensity, duration, and complexity of climate change effects is on the rise and thus climate-related mental health outcomes are also increasingâ€”adding to the already burgeoning burden of mental illness and mental problems globally. Acknowledging the mental health consequences of climate change helps the mental health community to discern and anticipate patterns of mental illness, like for example PTSD following extreme weather events. Also, an understanding of the unequal impacts of climate change on marginalized groups supports public health prevention strategies that seek to protect those most susceptible to mental illness and mental problems.</p>
