<p id="Par13" class="p">Within the disaster mental health literature, the links between extreme weather events and mental health effects are well established (see for example [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]). However, many of these studies tend not to connect extreme weather to a changing climate—instead referring to extreme weather events as natural disasters rather than events linked to anthropogenic climate change. Studies within this domain tend to focus on mental health outcomes of specific hazard events (e.g. the 2004 Tsunami in Malaysia, Hurricane Katrina in 2005; Southern Alberta floods in 2013) positioning each hazard as an isolated incident unconnected to the wicked problem of climate change. The risk of overlooking or minimizing the role of climate change within these hazardous events is that this creates a reactive culture of emergency response that inhibits appropriate and effective adaptation planning and preparation for complex emergencies that a changing climate can create.
