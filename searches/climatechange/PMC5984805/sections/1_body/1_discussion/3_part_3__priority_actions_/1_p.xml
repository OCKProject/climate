<p id="Par37" class="p">Acting on the health consequences of climate change requires actions rooted in both mitigation and adaptation at all levels—from global to local—and from all sectors and individuals. Climate change mitigation refers to overarching efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance carbon sinks to slow the speed, scale, and magnitude of climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. Key climate change mitigation priorities include reducing energy demand (through reduced consumption and increased energy efficiency); a swift and equitable transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy; reducing emissions from agriculture and forestry; and strengthening land-based emissions sequestration. Climate change adaptation refers to interventions that respond to the effects of climate change by adjusting, moderating, and coping with the risks and impacts of climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">98</xref>]. Adaptation is ultimately affected by the 
 <italic class="italic">capacity</italic> to adapt, which is the ability and willingness to respond to climate change mediated by individual and collective agency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>]. Adaptive capacity is determined by things like: governance, economics, infrastructure, technology, information and skills, institutions, and equity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">100</xref>]. Examples of adaptation interventions that address climate change and health include: surveillance and monitoring of disease burdens related to climate change and health; education (e.g. public health promotion of the risks of vector-borne illness), and capacity building (e.g. psychological first-aid, and surge capacities at hospitals and health care facilities); preparing for extreme weather events; and re-locating entire communities to geographic areas where sea-level rise and frequent extreme weather events are less-likely to occur [
