 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>]; the Sendai Framework, a 15-year disaster risk reduction program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>]; and, the United Nations Human Settlement Program that promotes sustainable urban development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">105</xref>]. There is a need, however, to harness health and mental health related synergies amongst these global agreements since none of these in and of themselves will likely be sufficient to address the future risks and impacts of climate change.
