<p class="p">Our study provides landscape-scale analyses of climate change on the habitat of a focal bird species in Canadaâ€™s eastern boreal forest. Since BBWO is considered an indicator species for recent deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in the boreal forest [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], our results suggest that a large number of species may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of forest disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) and climate change in this region. Forest harvesting appeared to be the single most important driver of change, because it reduces the area of old-growth coniferous stands, regardless of the climate scenario. Thus, the results of our study suggest that the conservation of these components of biodiversity may benefit from reduced harvesting levels and management strategies that promote coniferous species.
