<p class="p">The challenge we are confronting is how to balance the management of multiple forest values and ecosystem services while reducing uncertainty about the future conditions within which the forest is going to evolve, and projecting future habitats for species like the BBWO is part of that process. Finding convergence and implementing it in strategic forest planning is key to achieving sustainability. In that context, the generalist quality of a forest simulator such as LANDIS-II makes it a useful tool for integrating ecological processes and testing management strategies with multiple simultaneous objectives.</p>
