<p class="p">In addition to climate change, several studies have already pointed out that anthropogenic activities such as forestry and the extraction of mineral and energy resources, have a very significant impact on boreal bird assemblages, notably by modifying forest vegetation composition [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]). For instance, Ordonez et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] reported that areas exposed to both rapid climate warming and land-use changes are expected to undergo the fastest changes in biodiversity and ecosystem function in the continental United States. Recent climatic changes have already been identified as important drivers of bird population dynamics in Sweden, adding to the effects of other drivers such as land-use changes [
