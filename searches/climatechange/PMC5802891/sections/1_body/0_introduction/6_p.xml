<p class="p">The Black-backed Woodpecker (BBWO, 
 <italic class="italic">Picoides arcticus</italic>) is found in conifer-dominated over-mature and old-growth forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and in forest stands recently disturbed by wildfire or insect outbreak [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Territory sizes diminish according to prey abundance (mostly bark and wood-boring insects), which is dependent on the availability of recent deadwood [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] and related to forest age and incidence of disturbance [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. BBWO is considered an indicator species for recent deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in the boreal forest [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], and has been identified to be potentially threatened by climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Moreover, woodpecker abundance has been related to forest bird species richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Hence, we consider that BBWO represents a valuable focal species to understand the impacts of climate change on the biodiversity associated with recent deadwood and old-growth boreal forests.
