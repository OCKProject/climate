<p class="p">In this paper, we used the LANDIS-II forest landscape model to project the cumulative impacts of climate change and harvesting on the productivity of BBWO habitat across a large boreal forest landscape in eastern Canada. We translated forest attributes into BBWO habitats, and simulated BBWO potential productivity (number of fledglings) as a proxy to quantify the magnitude of climate change impacts. Furthermore, we assessed the relative importance of climate-induced changes in forest habitat on BBWO productivity occurring (i) at the stand scale (e.g., changes caused by changes in tree reproduction or growth); (ii) those resulting from changes in the fire regime; and (iii) those related to harvesting.</p>
