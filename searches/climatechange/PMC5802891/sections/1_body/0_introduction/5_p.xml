<p class="p">Most studies projecting future ranges of bird species rely on correlative species distribution models based mainly on projections of where climate conditions within the current species ranges are likely to occur in the future (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]). This approach does not take into account the projected migration of the habitat (e.g., forest cover) as it fails to consider the interactions among stand- and landscape-level impacts of climate change, tree dispersal abilities, and effects of anthropogenic disturbances on forest structure and hence on habitat distribution. Forest landscape models simulate stand- (e.g., forest succession, growth) and landscape-scale processes (e.g., seed dispersal, natural and anthropogenic disturbances; [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]) at temporal and spatial scales that make it possible to characterize wildlife habitats. Furthermore, forest landscape models can simulate the impact of climate change on these ecological processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] and, as such, may be useful to project the impacts of climate change on bird habitats. By doing so, forest landscape models allow more realistic projections of bird habitats than species distribution models by improving the representation of spatial legacies of the landscape, future forest disturbance dynamics, vegetation trajectories, and hence bird habitats in a climate change context [
