<p class="p">In addition to assessing cumulative impacts, disentangling and assessing the relative contributions of stand- and landscape-scale drivers of changes in vegetation on bird habitat are essential to understand how climate change and harvesting will influence the future of boreal bird assemblages. Recent analyses [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] have suggested that climate-induced changes in stand-scale processes, as well as changes in the fire regime, were more likely to impact future southern Canadian boreal forest landscapes than harvesting. Although the relative importance of harvesting and climate change impacts varies strongly, both regionally and globally [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], relatively little is known about how this affects bird habitats. Identifying and quantifying the impacts of the key drivers of change should facilitate the adaptation of current forest management strategies to minimize negative consequences [
