<p class="p">Climate change is expected to have a strong impact on global biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], including bird species [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Recent northward range expansions of breeding birds have already been documented and attributed to climate change in temperate North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], as well as in Europe [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Climate change-driven range shifts are projected to be most dramatic at northern latitudes, where polar amplification is driving more rapid warming than the global mean [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. As such, species currently restricted to boreal regions may experience range decrease due to the reduction in areas of suitable biomes caused by northward shifts in climate zones, such as projected for North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, positive temperature affinities and broad climatic tolerance suggest that many other species may expand their breeding distributions within the boreal region [
