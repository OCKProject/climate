<p class="p">Many boreal bird species rely on specific vegetation characteristics for different life history traits (e.g., nesting, feeding) that may be associated with different habitat types. Changes in boreal forest properties are thus likely to greatly affect habitat availability, triggering potential shifts in species demography and population persistence [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Indeed, climate change within boreal regions has already led to increased drought- and insect-induced tree mortality [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and increased wildfire activity [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Furthermore, there is evidence of northward shifts in tree speciesâ€™ ranges in recent decades, notably at the temperate-boreal interface (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). Anthropogenic climate forcing over the coming decades is projected to drive significant changes in boreal forest composition and age structure [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] through changes at the stand (e.g., mortality, competition, reproduction, growth) and landscape levels (e.g., natural disturbances) that are likely to impact the distribution of boreal bird species habitats. Indeed, current studies show that slow climate-induced vegetation changes have strongly constrained the poleward or altitudinal migration of some bird species (e.g., [
