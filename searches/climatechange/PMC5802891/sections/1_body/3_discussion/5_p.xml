<p class="p">Our simulations showed that climate-induced changes in stand-scale processes (e.g., regeneration, growth of trees) are likely to have little impact on future BBWO potential productivity. Previous simulations performed on southern Canadian boreal forests [

We projected generally smaller impacts of stand-level factors on forest landscapes, and hence on BBWO habitats, than those reported by Boulanger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], which we attribute to our study area lying further north. Moreover, unlike changes resulting from fire or harvesting [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>], climate-induced changes in growth in forest landscapes generally manifest themselves on a longer-term perspective. Such system “inertias” might explain why stand-level drivers had little relative impact on BBWO potential productivity over the relatively short simulated 100-yr period. Our analyses did show that under RCP 8.5, black spruce biomass would strongly decline (&gt;25%), but mostly after 2070. In this context, climate-induced impacts on stand-scale processes might impose increasing constraints on BBWO habitats and, consequently, on BBWO productivity, but over a much longer-term (&gt;100 yr).
