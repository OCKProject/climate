<p class="p">Our simulations provide insights into how climate change and forest management practices may affect the future of BBWO in Canada’s eastern boreal forest, but there are some important caveats. First, fire effects on forest landscapes probably were overestimated because vegetation feedbacks were not taken into account. Such feedbacks are likely to be negative [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref096" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], with recurrent fires both reducing fuel loads and stimulating the production of less flammable fuel, i.e., young, predominantly deciduous, stands. Second, the impacts of climate change on spruce budworm population dynamics and hence on the vulnerability of spruce budworm host species were not included. Third, the PICUS simulations did not consider the possible effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization on tree growth and stand succession. The potential interaction of higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with significantly longer growing seasons adds uncertainty to the predictions of reduced forest growth, particularly in regions where soil moisture and nutrients are non-limiting (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]). Also, given that productivity patterns were calibrated for 30-yr averages of a future climate, our results likely overestimate survival and forest productivity because potential widespread “pulses” of drought-induced dieback (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]) were not considered. Moreover, variations in total BBWO potential productivity are not solely dependent upon the processes analyzed in this study. Temporal and spatial variations might also arise from ongoing stand development dictated by initial stand conditions or result from recent fire activity, for instance.
