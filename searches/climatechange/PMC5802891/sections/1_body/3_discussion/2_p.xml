<p class="p">Our simulations suggest that the cumulative impacts of forest harvesting and climate change on the forest ecosystem will cause major reductions in the availability of future BBWO habitat, with the potential productivity of this focal species being more severely reduced under stronger anthropogenic climate forcing. Among other impacts, climate change would impose changes in the relative importance of available habitat types for BBWO potential productivity. Under the baseline climate scenario, populations were largely maintained by the productivity of old coniferous stands. With climate warming, however, recently burned old coniferous forests would likely become more important for supporting BBWO. Conversely, increased reliance on burned forests under a warmer climate would not completely compensate for decreases in productivity due to the loss of old-growth coniferous forest, notably to harvesting. As a consequence, the projected potential productivity of BBWO by 2100 (reduced to below &lt;10 fledglings/100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr) may not be high enough to support sustainable populations under any realistic anthropogenic forcing scenario. Based on historical forest age-structure, BBWO productivity was estimated to be ca. 75 fledglings/100 km

Although we cannot estimate the carrying capacity or population growth index from our simulations (see section below), the major declines in the potential number of fledglings projected for all climate warming scenarios (85–93% decrease) highlight a major threat to the long-term sustainability of the population (
