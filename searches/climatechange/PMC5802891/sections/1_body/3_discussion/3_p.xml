<p class="p">Nevertheless, our results show that important declines in BBWO potential productivity would likely occur in this area even under present-day climate, underlining the importance of non climatically-driven changes. Harvesting was found to be the most important driver of changes in BBWO potential productivity, regardless of the anthropogenic forcing scenario. In this context, harvesting would interact synergistically with climate-induced changes in forest landscapes to further shrink high-quality BBWO habitats over the long term. This striking result was contrary to our expectations as recent analyses [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] have indicated that harvesting should have relatively little impact, compared to changes in the fire regime and in stand-scale processes, in projected future southern boreal forest landscapes in eastern Canada. These unexpected results might be explained by the fact that harvesting rates in the study area are rather high (between 0.4–0.8%.yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for most forest management units) when compared with those reported by Boulanger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] when they simulated a southern part of the eastern boreal forest in which harvesting had been less active compared with the northern region over the last decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Moreover, the estimation of BBWO potential productivity relied significantly on specific age-defined stand types (with the most productive stand types being associated with old-growth forests, either burned or not), a feature that is not directly considered when assessing the relative impacts of harvesting and climate change on tree species biomass 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic>. By targeting old-growth stands, high business-as-usual logging rates would likely contribute to the decline of suitable late-successional coniferous stands, while maintaining some important deciduous species, including trembling aspen, white birch and red maple, regardless of the climate scenarios. Boucher et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] have shown that high harvesting pressure has historically contributed to marked decreases in the abundance of old-growth stands and increases in pioneer, deciduous stands in Québec’s boreal forest. General decreases in old-growth stands due to high harvesting pressure might explain, to a large extent, the decrease in potential number of fledglings, even under baseline climate conditions. Silvicultural practices, as well as natural disturbances, have been found to play an important role in defining how landscapes will respond to climate change (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref089" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]), notably by providing new opportunities for climate-adapted species to invade a site [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]. Our 100-yr simulations did not reveal increasing impacts of harvesting along with increasing climate forcing. However, we can expect that the interacting impacts of harvesting and climate change might worsen beyond 2100, as harvesting would increasingly favour the recruitment of warmer-adapted deciduous species under increased climate forcing, and reduce the supply of suitable habitats dominated by boreal conifers. Longer simulations would be needed to explore these interactions on future boreal bird habitats.
