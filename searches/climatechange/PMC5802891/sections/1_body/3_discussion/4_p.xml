<p class="p">Despite the major impacts of harvesting, climate-driven changes in BBWO productivity will be very significant and mostly linked to changes in the fire regime. Fire seasons in the study area have been projected to lengthen, leading to more frequent and severe fire-conducive weather [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. BBWO is a disturbance-adapted species [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], and it is known to respond positively to natural disturbances in boreal forests, especially wildfires [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, we found that large increases in area burned, especially under “worst-case” climate forcing (i.e., RCP 8.5), would be detrimental to BBWO productivity. As such, the negative impacts of a climate-induced increase in fire activity might look contradictory. Negative impacts would be the result of a very sharp long-term increase in fire activity, cancelling the short-term positive impacts of increased area burned. Impacts of long-term increases in fire activity on BBWO habitats would likely be two-fold. First, increased area burned would lower the mean forest stand age, thus reducing the availability of large patches of highly suitable old forest stands. Sharp increases in fire activity were found to be detrimental by old-growth bird specialists in Alberta [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Second, increased burning rates would promote the regeneration/re-sprouting of pioneer deciduous species (i.e., white birch, trembling aspen and red maple) at the expense of late-successional conifers (i.e., balsam fir, black spruce), further decreasing the availability of highly suitable old coniferous stands and those subsequently available for burning. Previous simulations performed on southern boreal landscapes [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] also showed that very short fire return intervals (&lt; 50 yr), as projected for the RCP 8.5 radiative forcing by 2070 in the study area [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], would almost certainly cause the widespread decline of boreal late-successional fire-avoiders such as white spruce and balsam fir [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref091" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">91</xref>]. Black spruce forests may also decline rapidly if the fire return interval were to shorten to values close to that of typical seed-bearing age (ca. 30 yr) [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>]. Very short fire return intervals, comparable to those projected here (ca. 30 yr under RCP 8.5, see S2), would likely effectively prevent the gradual age-related conversion of pioneer deciduous stands into late-successional coniferous stands, reinforcing long-term decreases in potential fledgling productivity.
