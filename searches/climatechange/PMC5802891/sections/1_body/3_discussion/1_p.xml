<p class="p">Few studies have projected the cumulative impacts of climate change and harvesting at both the stand and landscape levels on bird habitats using a spatially explicit forest landscape models (but see [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]). Our study attempted to provide a more realistic estimation of the cumulative impacts of climate change and harvesting on the habitat and productivity of a focal boreal bird species. Our results demonstrate these impacts are likely to be detrimental for the BBWO with a projected decline of 81 to 92% in potential productivity by 2100.
