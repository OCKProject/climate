<p class="p">Of greatest importance, our results suggest that maintaining current harvesting strategies could exacerbate the negative impacts of climate change on BBWO habitats and potential productivity. Even without climate forcing, however, business-as-usual harvesting strategies could lead to marked decreases in BBWO productivity. Similar results were also found by Mahon et al. [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], our results suggest that many boreal bird species may be subject to dramatic population decrease due to climate change, and to anthropogenically-induced reductions in mature coniferous forest cover. Based on species distribution models, Stralberg et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>] highlight the importance of forest growth limitation and succession on time-lags in bird population responses to climate change under which boreal species associated with mature forests may suffer dramatic reductions in suitable habitat over the next century. Reducing harvesting levels in this area might mitigate the impact of climate-induced decrease in old-growth coniferous stands. Partial-cutting strategies that promote the retention of &gt;50% of the stand cover and old stems, or hindering deciduous regeneration, might also be favoured in this context. Retention of a minimum old-growth forest content upfront during harvest planning might also reduce yearly variations in annual allowable cut due to fire losses [
