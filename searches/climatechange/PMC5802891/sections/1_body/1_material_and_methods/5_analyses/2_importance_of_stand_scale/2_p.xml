<p class="p">In addition to the proportion of variance explained, we also sought to estimate the quantitative impact of each driver of change on BBWO potential productivity, while controlling for all other factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. To do so, impacts were assessed through sensitivity analyses by calculating ΔProd, which is the percentage difference in simulated BBWO total potential productivity at the regional level (i.e., study area) between the simulations considering all cumulative impacts (i.e., the “full” model) and corresponding simulations omitting the driver of interest (i.e., the “reduced” model) (see below), for a given time step (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) and forcing scenario. Reduced model testing for impacts of changes in fire and in stand-scale drivers used simulations where fire regime and SEP / maxANPP / maxAGB parameters, respectively, were calibrated for the baseline climate. To assess the quantitative impacts of harvesting, the reduced model used simulations that simply omitted harvesting while controlling for all other factors.
