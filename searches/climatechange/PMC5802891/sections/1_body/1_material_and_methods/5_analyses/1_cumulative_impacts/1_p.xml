<p class="p">The cumulative impacts of harvesting and climate change were assessed by comparing temporal trends in the following simulated variables: 1) specific tree AGB; 2) total BBWO potential productivity under each climate scenario; 3) BBWO potential productivity in each habitat type; and 4) relative contributions of the three most important habitat types estimated for each climate scenario. For each climate scenario, results for these variables were obtained by averaging outputs [either tree AGB or BBWO habitat-related variables] from the five replicates of the simulations used to assess the cumulative impacts for each climate scenario.</p>
