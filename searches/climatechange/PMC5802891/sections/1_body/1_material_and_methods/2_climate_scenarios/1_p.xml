Future climate projections from CanESM2 were downloaded from the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive for each of three different radiative forcing scenarios, known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP; e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]), namely RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. Monthly time-series of current climate (2000–2010) were interpolated from climate station records using the data of McKenney et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. According to CanESM2 projections, mean annual temperature would increase by about 3.5°C (RCP 2.6) to 7.5°C (RCP 8.5) throughout the southern boreal region by 2100 (compared with c. 2000), while average precipitation is projected to increase by 10 to 25% (
