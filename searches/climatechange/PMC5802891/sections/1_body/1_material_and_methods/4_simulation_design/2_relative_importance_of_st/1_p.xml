<p class="p">We ran additional simulations according to a full, three-way factorial design to assess the specific importance of harvesting as well as climate-induced changes in stand-scale processes and fire on BBWO productivity. The effects of stand-level drivers (i.e., climate effects on SEP, maxANPP and maxAGB) were tested either by keeping these parameters constant, according to baseline calibration conditions, or by updating them according to the respective RCP scenarios. Similarly, sensitivity to fire effects was tested by including or omitting the impacts of climate change on the fire regime, where fire parameters calibrated for the baseline period were either kept constant throughout the simulation period or were updated according to the projections of Boulanger et al.

This full three-way factorial design was repeated for each of the three RCP scenarios. Five replicates were run for each set of simulations under each forcing scenario for a total of 120 simulations (5 replicates * 2 harvesting levels [no harvesting, full harvesting] * 2 fire levels [baseline fire level, projected fire level] * 2 stand-scale levels [baseline and projected dynamic Biomass Succession parameters] * 3 RCP scenarios [RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5]). The impacts of SBW outbreaks were included as a “background” disturbance in all simulations.
