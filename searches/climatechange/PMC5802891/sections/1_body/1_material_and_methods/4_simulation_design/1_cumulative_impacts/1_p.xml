<p class="p">To estimate the cumulative impacts of harvesting and climate change on BBWO productivity, we ran simulations in which successional dynamics as well as all disturbances (wildfire, spruce budworm and forest harvesting) were included. Five replicates were run for 100 yr, starting in the year 2000, under each climate forcing scenario with 5-yr time steps. Except for scenarios involving the baseline climate, climate-sensitive parameters (fire regime, maxANPP, maxAGB and SEP) were allowed to change in 2010, 2040 and 2070, according to the average climate corresponding to each forcing scenario.</p>
