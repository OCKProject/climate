<p class="p">For all aggregated patches of each habitat type, BBWO potential productivity was estimated as the theoretical number of young produced, based on mean productivity for each habitat type (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191645.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) multiplied by the number of patches. We defined total BBWO productivity as all fledglings that could be produced in the study area, for all habitat types combined. The relative percentage contribution of each habitat type was then estimated by dividing its potential productivity by the total potential productivity over a given period (relative contribution of a habitat type = potential productivity of this habitat type/total productivity).
