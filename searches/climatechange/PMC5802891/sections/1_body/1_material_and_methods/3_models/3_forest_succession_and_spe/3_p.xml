<p class="p">In the LANDIS-II Biomass Succession extension, the carrying capacity of a given landtype is defined by the maxAGB. This value was set by averaging total AGB of a stand simulated by PICUS after it has reached a stable biomass state, i.e., following the early growth phase of stand development. maxANPP can only be achieved under free growing conditions, i.e. in the total absence of inter-specific competition. To derive maxANPP from the PICUS outputs, we calculated current annual increments (kg·ha

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) over the entire simulation period, which is calculated as total AGB of all trees ≥ 1.3 m tall at the end of each year plus any biomass removed that year by mortality, minus total AGB calculated at the end of the previous year. Maximum values were typically observed during the early stages of stand development (see

SEP is defined as the probability of a given species’ cohort to successfully establish itself on a given landtype during one time step, under ideal conditions (i.e., when seeds are available and light conditions are adequate), and it can range from 0 to 1. We considered the time necessary for stems &gt;1.3 m tall to accumulate AGB (t) in PICUS as the average result of a random process associated with a constant annual probability of 1/t. We thus simulated the probability of successful establishment of a cohort as a Bernouilli trial conducted every year during a 5-yr time step, i.e., the probability of at least one success in five consecutive trials based on binomial distribution.
