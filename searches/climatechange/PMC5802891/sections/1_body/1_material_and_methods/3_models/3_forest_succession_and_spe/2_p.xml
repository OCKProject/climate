<p class="p">Specific parameters that define basic life-history traits were assigned to all species (cf. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191645.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for a full listing). These parameters were homogeneous throughout the entire landscape and kept constant during the simulation. Parameters were collected from various sources (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]), including expert judgment when empirical information was unavailable. Species- and landtype-specific response parameters for the Biomass Succession extension (namely species establishment probabilities [SEP], maximum annual net primary productivity [maxANPP] and maximum AGB [maxAGB], see below) were simulated for LANDIS-II using PICUS. These three parameters (often referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">dynamic inputs</italic> in the LANDIS-II literature) can be updated during a LANDIS-II simulation to account for the effects of climate change.
