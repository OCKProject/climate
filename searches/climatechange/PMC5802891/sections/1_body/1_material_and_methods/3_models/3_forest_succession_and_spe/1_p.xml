<p class="p">Forest succession was simulated using a version of the LANDIS-II Biomass Succession extension v 3.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] modified to account for strict serotiny in jack pine. This extension emulates succession at the stand (grid cell) level by simulating the recruitment and growth of tree cohorts (not individual trees). Multiple cohorts of tree species may establish themselves within each grid cell and interact with each other through resource (i.e., growing space) limitations based on species-specific traits. Succession in each cell is driven by these stand-level interactions, in addition to disturbance history and seed source availability.
