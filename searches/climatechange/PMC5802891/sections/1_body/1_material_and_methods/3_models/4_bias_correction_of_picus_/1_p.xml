<p class="p">Succession patterns under the baseline climate scenario were visualized and qualitatively verified (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191645.s003" class="xref">S3 Appendix</xref>) against those reported in the literature (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]). Accordingly, some adjustments were made to the species-specific static growth and mortality curve shape parameters (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0191645.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), which determine the acceleration of each speciesâ€™ growth rate and how soon mortality begins as each cohort of species reaches its maximum longevity. Additional details about this procedure can be found in
