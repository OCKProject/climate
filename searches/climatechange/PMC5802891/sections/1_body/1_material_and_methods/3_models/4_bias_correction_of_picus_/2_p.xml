<p class="p">Finally, we validated the dynamic inputs obtained from PICUS by comparing the initial AGB of each species produced during the spin-up phase of LANDIS-II under the baseline climate scenario against the biomass reported in the NFI forest cover maps [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. These biomass values sometimes showed substantial bias that was minimized by a two-stage correction procedure. First, maxAGB and maxANNP parameters for all species other than balsam fir were multiplied by a single scalar to adjust average initial total biomass within the simulated landscape to agree with landscape-scale biomass densities reported in the NFI cover maps. Second, simulations for balsam fir required special treatment because of a previously documented over-sensitivity to limited water availability [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], which caused balsam fir biomass to be systematically underestimated. This was adjusted by multiplying maxAGB and maxANNP for balsam fir by a larger scalar. Additional details and illustrations can be found in
