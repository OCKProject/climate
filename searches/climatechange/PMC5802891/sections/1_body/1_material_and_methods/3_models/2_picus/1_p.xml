<p class="p">LANDIS-II requires specific, dynamic input parameters to simulate the effect of climate change on forests, which are generally derived from more ecologically detailed, fine-scale forest stand models. Here, we used PICUS version 1.5 [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>], which is an individual tree-based, spatially explicit, forest gap model, to develop the dynamic input parameters required to initialize LANDIS-II. PICUS simulates the germination, establishment, growth, and mortality of individual trees in 100-m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> gaps or “patches” of forest area. Generally, 100 of these patches are simulated simultaneously as interacting square cells on a contiguous 10 x 10 grid, corresponding to a 1-ha plot sample of forest stand. PICUS runs on annual time steps and accounts for spatially explicit interactions among patches via a 3D canopy light module, and simulates seed dispersal explicitly, as well as the effects of climate and soil properties on tree germination and growth.
