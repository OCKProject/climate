<p class="p">To develop the dynamic input parameters for LANDIS-II, we used PICUS to simulate mono-specific stands of each tree species for all landtypes under four different climate forcing scenarios (baseline, RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) and for specific periods (2000–2010, 2011–2040, 2041–2070, 2071–2100), for a total of 15,130 PICUS simulations. Each PICUS simulation was run at an annual timesteps for 300 yr, assuming a stable climate based on the given forcing scenario and 30-yr period. Specific climate and soil details pertaining to a given LANDIS-II landtype were used as inputs for the PICUS simulations. Tree species in PICUS simulations were parameterized (
