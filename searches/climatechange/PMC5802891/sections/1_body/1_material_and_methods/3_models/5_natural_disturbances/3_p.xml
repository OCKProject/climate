<p class="p">Outbreaks of SBW were simulated using the LANDIS-II Biological Disturbance Agent (BDA) extension v3.0 [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], which is specifically designed to simulate host tree mortality following insect outbreaks. Host tree species for SBW included, from the most to the least vulnerable: balsam fir, white spruce, red spruce and black spruce. Outbreaks are simulated as probabilistic events at the cell level with probabilities being a function of site and neighbourhood resource dominance (e.g., host abundance within a 1-km radius of the cell) as well as regional outbreak status. Outbreak impacts (tree mortality) are contingent on these probabilities as well as on host species’ and age-specific susceptibility. Parameters used in this study were obtained from various sources for the mixed boreal forest [
