<p class="p">All disturbance regimes, historical (baseline) and projected, have been quantified in previous published studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. In our LANDIS-II simulations, fire effects were captured using the LANDIS-II Base Fire extension [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>], which simulates stochastic fire events dependent upon fire ignition, initiation and spread. Fire regime data (annual area burned, fire occurrence, and mean fire size) were first summarized into ‘‘fire regions” corresponding to the intersection of the study region with the Canadian Homogeneous Fire Regime (HFR) zones of Boulanger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Baseline and future fire regime parameters within each fire region were calibrated according to models developed by Boulanger et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] and further updated for different RCP scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>].
