This allowed remotely-sensed estimates of Canadian forest composition to be merged with the greater stand-structural detail obtainable from forest inventory plots. Using species biomass as well as mean annual temperature and total annual precipitation as variables, we performed a nearest neighbour spectral analysis (NNSA) to attribute the FIP showing the smallest Euclidean distance to each 250-m grid cell. Grid cells and FIP were binned into 20-yr age classes; NNSA imputations were then conducted separately for each age class group to ensure that the Euclidean distance between the FIP and the 250-m cell could be attributed more closely to site productivity rather than stand age. Using this technique, we aimed to populate initial LANDIS-II forest landscapes so that they resembled actual forest conditions in the early 2000s. Grid cells with less than 50% forest cover (by area, according to the inventories) were excluded from the simulations. A total of 89 landtypes were created. Further details can be found in Boulanger et al. [
