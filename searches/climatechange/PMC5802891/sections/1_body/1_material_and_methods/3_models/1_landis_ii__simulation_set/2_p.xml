<p class="p">In this experiment, grid cell resolution was set to 250 m (6.25 ha) and simulations were run at a 5-yr time step across all activated extensions. All cells were assigned user-defined landtypes that represent relatively homogeneous soil and climate conditions (as described below). Seed dispersal occurs following the algorithm described in Ward et al. [
