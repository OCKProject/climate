 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. It comprises a library of model extensions to simulate a variety of stand- and landscape-level ecosystem processes, and a core module that manages interactions among the extensions [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In LANDIS-II, the forest landscape is represented by a grid of interacting cells within which stand-level forest processes occur, while landscape-level processes, such as tree seed dispersal and disturbances, generally affect multiple cells in a spatially interactive manner. Cell resolution and time steps in LANDIS-II are defined by the user, allowing different time steps to be set for each extension.
