<p class="p">Forest harvesting was simulated using the Biomass Harvest extension (v3.0; [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]). Historical harvest data (harvested AGB) were retrieved from Québec’s provincial records for the 1980–2000 period (Gouvernment du Québec, unpublished data). Mean harvested patch size and total harvested area were summarized by “management areas”, i.e., either by forest management units for public lands (87.3% of the study area) or by ecodistricts [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] for private lands and for lands located north of the northern limits of merchantable harvesting (12.7% of the study area). Only clearcuts were simulated on public lands as this logging strategy is the most frequently used in the study area [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. On private lands, we used a national map of forest disturbances derived from MODIS imagery [
 <xref rid="pone.0191645.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] to simulate biomass removed by harvesting during 2002–2011. Prescriptions on private lands included low-level partial harvesting (1–40% of biomass removed), high-level partial harvesting (41–80% biomass removed) and clearcutting. In the simulations, clearcutting was represented by the removal of all age cohorts, except for the 0–5 yr cohort. Only stands that contained tree cohorts older than 60 yr were allowed to be harvested. Harvesting parameters were set so that a constant area was harvested throughout the simulations, unless there was not enough stands older than 60 yr.
