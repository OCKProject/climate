<p class="p">Most of the changes in tree species biomass under stronger anthropogenic climate forcing would result from changes in the fire regime (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0191645.s005" class="xref">S5 Appendix</xref>). Increasing fire activity would be detrimental for the AGB of virtually all tree species, with changes in AGB (ΔB) exceeding -50% for the majority of species by 2100 under RCP 8.5. Trembling aspen appears to be the only species for which large increases in fire activity would not noticeably affect AGB (

The detrimental impacts of harvesting would also be rather important for many species except trembling aspen, balsam fir, white birch and red maple, regardless of climate forcing. Aside from these four species, harvesting would reduce AGB by ca. 25–50% by 2100. Climate-induced changes in stand-level processes would be generally negligible or positive for most boreal species in the study area, except for black spruce, for which an increasing warming would decrease ΔB by &gt;30% by 2100 under RCP 8.5. Except for balsam fir, black spruce, jack pine and trembling aspen, moderate (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5) anthropogenic climate forcing was projected to actually increase ΔB. Stronger positive impacts of climate-induced changes in stand-level processes on ΔB would occur under RCP 8.5 for temperate deciduous species, including red and sugar maples, beech and red oak (
