<p class="p">Total AGB was projected to decrease slightly over time in the study area under the baseline climate scenario (from 48.1 t/ha in 2000 to 42.1 t/ha in 2100; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Under the baseline scenario, trembling aspen showed a large increase in biomass (from 4.8 t/ha in 2000 to 13.1 t/ha in 2100) whereas black spruce showed a large decrease (from 24.2 t/ha in 2000 to 7.5 t/ha in 2100). Total AGB continually decreased as projected warming proceeded, with RCP 8.5 driving the largest (most rapid) reductions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Overall, compared to initial conditions, total AGB decreased by 32.8%, 52.4% and 65.0% over the entire simulation period under the RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios, respectively. Coniferous tree species, notably balsam fir and black spruce, were most negatively impacted by climate forcing with reductions in biomass of 82.9% and 92.6%, respectively, while trembling aspen and red maple projections showed increases of 84% and 455%, respectively, under RCP 8.5. Absolute changes in biomass of other species were minor, regardless of the forcing scenario, largely because their simulated abundance was low throughout all simulations.
