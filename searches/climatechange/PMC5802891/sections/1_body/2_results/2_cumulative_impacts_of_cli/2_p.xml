<p class="p">The projected number of fledglings produced in each habitat type varied throughout the simulation period. Recently burned old coniferous stands, old coniferous unburned stands, and older burned coniferous stands produced the most BBWO fledglings, regardless of the climate scenario, while production of fledglings in old mixed unburned coniferous stands and recently burned young stands was very low (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Under the RCP climate forcing scenarios, BBWO potential productivity in recently burned old coniferous stands increased rapidly, from ca. 14 fledglings/100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr in 2010 to ca. 25–30 by 2020, before declining drastically to ≤6 fledglings/100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr in 2100 (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Despite these variations, the relative contribution of recently burned old coniferous stands increased throughout the simulation period under each climatic scenario, and reached approximately 56% (RCP 4.5) to 62% (RCP 8.5) of the total production of BBWO fledglings in 2100 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Old coniferous unburned stands, the most productive habitat type for BBWO at the beginning of the simulation period, showed striking declines under each forcing scenario from ca. 40 fledglings/100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr down to &lt;4 fledglings/100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr in 2100 for all forcing scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). At the beginning of the simulated period, old coniferous unburned stands represented ca. 70–75% of the total production of BBWO fledglings, but this was projected to decrease to only 28 and 33% for RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The total production in old coniferous unburned stands would remain approximately twice as high under the baseline scenario than under increasing anthropogenic climate forcing. The relative contribution of older burned coniferous stands and old mixed unburned coniferous stands to total BBWO production was relatively small during the entire simulation period, with a maximum of ca. 5% and ca. 0.5% in 2100, respectively (
