<p class="p">Under the baseline climate scenario, old coniferous unburned stands were projected to remain the most regionally productive habitat type for BBWO (between ca. 60â€“71% of total fledglings produced). However, shifts were projected by ca. 2050 under increasing anthropogenic climate forcing, where recently burned old coniferous stands were projected to become more productive than old coniferous unburned stands, with the differences being amplified under the more severe climate forcing scenarios (
