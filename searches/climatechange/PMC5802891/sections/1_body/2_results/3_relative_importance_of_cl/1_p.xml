<p class="p">Harvesting was projected to reduce BBWO potential productivity throughout the simulation period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>), and it was generally was the most important single driver of change under all RCP scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>). Indeed, harvesting ranked as the second most important driver of change only in 2020 and after 2080 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 while being most important under all other simulated conditions. Regardless of climate forcing, changes in fire regime were initially projected to increase BBWO potential productivity by 20â€“25% in 2020, but thereafter, further changes in the fire regime had negative impacts, reaching rather similar values to those reported for harvesting by 2100 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191645.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). Climate-induced changes in stand-scale drivers had minimal impacts on BBWO potential productivity throughout the simulation period compared with harvesting or climate-induced changes in fire disturbance (
