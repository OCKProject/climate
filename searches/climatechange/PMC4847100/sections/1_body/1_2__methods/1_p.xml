<p class="p">We investigated different cities (20,000 &lt; population &lt; 4,000,000) with a Mediterranean climate that have climate action plans, using the following methods: internet search of municipal websites, search of keywords in the University of Haifa Library Catalogue, Google search engine, Google scholar and websites of international organizations such as the United Nations and World Health Organizations (keywords: adaptation, climate change plan, climate action plan, climate change adaptation plan, CAP, climate change in cities). We searched in English, French and Spanish. We identified five Med-cities [

 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] with a comprehensive plan which refers to various aspects of expected health impacts of climate change: Adelaide, Australia; Barcelona, Spain; Cape Town, South Africa; Los Angeles (LA), United States and Santiago, Chile (

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. These five examples deal with similar vulnerability challenges related to climate change and health in a Mediterranean climate (such as heat stress, floods, drought, loss of biodiversity) which may be more complicated than in more extreme environments [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-13-00438" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. It is important to note that the climate of Santiago is slightly different (a “continental Mediterranean climate”) since it is not a coastal city but located about 100 km from the South Pacific Ocean at an elevation of ~520 m.
