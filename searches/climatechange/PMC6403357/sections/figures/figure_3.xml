  <p class="p">Scenario 3: The effect of gradually increasing temperatures on (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) fast-adapting coral communities (
   <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> calculated using a 10-year base period) and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) slow-adapting communities (
   <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> calculated using a 50-year base period), if extreme thermal events would not occur. The graphs show the relative cover (mean ± SD) for massive (blue) and branching (orange) corals over time for a temperature increase by 2 and 4 °C over 90 years. The triangle plots above show the initial trait compositions (far left triangles), and their evolution for both morphotypes within the coral community in 20-year steps, starting from 2020 (i.e. 10 years after the start of the simulation). In the trait space a circle centre indicates the trait combination for a species and the circle size indicates the coverage (mean in dark ± SD in lighter colours) of this trait combination. Monthly mean temperatures are indicated in red solid lines and long-term summertime mean temperatures (
   <italic class="italic">LMST</italic>) in red dashed line. The green bars indicate the temporal occurrence and the length of a bar indicates the magnitude (degree heating days) of extreme thermal events.
