 </sup> that, in many cases, are manifestations of distinctly contrary survival and reproduction strategies; i.e. different growth forms (e.g. massive and branching), reproductive modes (brooding/spawning; gonochoric/hermaphroditic), tolerances to stress, and competitive abilities in acquiring and holding space. Physiological processes demand resources and resource limitations give rise to trade-offs among different life history traits, such as competitiveness, stress tolerance and growth rates

 </sup> related life-history traits to environmental conditions. This study found that corallite size influenced stress tolerance, while reproduction and colony growth showed higher levels of constitutive immunity in gonochoric than in hermaphroditic species. In contrast to massive corals which invested most of their resources in immunity, branching species preferentially allocated resources to growth

A modelling study demonstrated how different life history strategies of corals influenced community dynamics under different disturbance conditions: An undisturbed community consisted mainly of massive species, while moderate thermal and mechanical disturbance levels favoured the fast-growing but temperature-sensitive
