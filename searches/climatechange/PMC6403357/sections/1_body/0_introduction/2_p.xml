 </sup>, meaning that species and communities have to be able to adapt at considerably faster rates. Our simulation approach examines the required rate of adaption by coral species and communities over time but does not discriminate between potential mechanisms such as genetic adaptation, utilization of alternative zooxanthellae, or acclimation
