<p id="Par7" class="p">In Scenario 1 (used as a baseline) we analysed how initial coral cover and the occurrence of mechanical disturbance events influence a coral community that is not stressed by coral bleaching. In Scenario 2 we added different frequencies of extreme thermal events to explore the recovery potential of coral communities and trait-based changes in community composition following bleaching events. Scenario 3 extends on Scenario 2 by adding gradual increases in temperatures, equivalent to temperature increases under different IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways, i.e. RCP 2.6 to 8.5, but with constant rates of change

 </sup>. In the latter scenario we also identified adaptation rates required to enable coral communities to sustain themselves under different climate change scenarios, by comparing the responses of fast-adapting and more slowly adapting coral communities. Differences in adaptation rates were mimicked in the model by calculating degree heating days (DHD) based on deviations from long-term mean summer temperatures (LMST) calculated over different time periods (10 to 50 years; see Methods). The use of shorter time period to calculate LMST results in lower DHD values and thus reduced bleaching susceptibility in the coral community. Adaptation rates are expressed as degrees Celsius per decade. These values represent the seawater temperature increase that coral species would need to accommodate in order to survive.
