<p id="Par21" class="p">This simulation study explores life-history traits and interactions in coral reefs with an unprecedented level of detail and allows new insights into how coral communities cope with different climate change scenarios. Nevertheless, as with every model, the results have to be evaluated in context of the underlying assumptions and constraints. Within this study all species had the same amount of resources to allocate to traits (there were no super-organisms) and we only allowed the species to allocate resources once, in order to extrapolate which trait combination would be best fitted to specific environmental conditions. Temperature adaptation was mimicked on the community level, but we did not allow for adaptation or evolution of traits for single species during simulation runs, which might alter long-term outcomes significantly. We took account of mechanical disturbance events and temperature induced bleaching of corals but left out the effect of increased CO
