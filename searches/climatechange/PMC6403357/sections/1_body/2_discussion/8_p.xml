<p id="Par22" class="p">We kept the biological ranges of coral traits in a moderate range to explore the fate of existing coral communities in a future climate. Furthermore, our study explored a theoretical trait-space for coral species and did not aim to extrapolate these simulations on a global scale. This would require identification of representative reefs worldwide and, for each reef, a description of the combinations of traits and species present, current environmental conditions and local SST projections, as demonstrated by Logan
