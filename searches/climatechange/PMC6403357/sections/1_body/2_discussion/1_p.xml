<p id="Par15" class="p">Our results demonstrate that only specific life-history traits enable corals to persist under conditions of a global increase in seawater temperature and, possibly, contribute to community recovery under more stable climatic conditions in the future. Nevertheless, as many corals are already living at their physiological limits
