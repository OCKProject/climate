<p id="Par17" class="p">If extreme temperature events occurred at intervals of 10 or fewer years, species composition in branching corals underwent a clear shift to heat-tolerant species (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In massive corals, fast-growing and heat-tolerant species dominated. Populations of heat-tolerant species can survive periods of scarce recruitment

 </sup> and, once temperature-sensitive competitors were eliminated, more heat-tolerant species were able to increase population sizes and hence their reproductive output for future generations. This effect has also been observed in the putative shift from branching to massive growth forms in outer reef slope communities in Moorea, French Polynesia
