 </sup>. In our simulations we found that fast community adaptation rates (up to 0.45 °C per decade) prevented bleaching almost entirely for moderate thermal events and buffered the effects of extreme thermal events. Even temperature increases of 4 °C (RCP 8.5) by the end of the century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) affected these communities only marginally. Other studies in which the authors use a similar rolling climatology to analyze the adaptation potential of coral reefs report similar results, and conclude that coral community adaptation rates of up to 0.4 °C per decade

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), and hence, an overestimation of coral survival. When the model incorporated slower adaptation rates (i.e. 0.022–0.09 °C per decade, corresponding to the calculation of 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> over 50 years), there was a strong decline in coral cover and mainly temperature-tolerant branching species survived to the end of the simulation period. Massive species were selected for fast growth and heat tolerance which also happened at Sesoko Island reefs, Japan after a bleaching event

 </sup>. In our study, while trajectories in total cover behaved similarly for massive and branching corals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), the underlying mechanisms were substantially different. Compared to branching corals, massive corals generally suffered less from mechanical or thermal disturbances, but recovered at low rates due to slower growth. Branching corals were more sensitive to both modes of disturbance and their populations always suffered high disturbance mortality. Nevertheless, due to their fast growth rates they were able replenish losses from disturbances in a few years.
