<p id="Par16" class="p">Direct competition among coral species only played an important role when simulated reefs were left undisturbed by extreme thermal events and mechanical disturbance events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Branching corals were favoured by the occurrence of mechanical disturbance events, as well as by low initial coral cover (in Scenario 1). Disturbances create recruitment opportunities for fast-growing branching or stress-tolerant coral species, irrespective of their type, which may then even form canopies that shade out other organisms or prevent them from settling

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). However, in a trade-off, fast-growing branching species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora</italic>) are very often more sensitive to bleaching. Consequently, under climate change conditions the dominance of these species might increase ecosystem resilience only in the mid-term, because they exclude more heat-tolerant species, which could subsequently result in the eradication of entire reef communities affected by recurring extreme thermal events
