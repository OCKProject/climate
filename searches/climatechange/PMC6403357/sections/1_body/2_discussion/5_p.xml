 </sup> by 2100, depending on the effectiveness of collective action to deal with climate change. Our results indicate that some coral species have a good chance of survival under the RCP 2.6 scenario (~1 °C above current conditions; 1.5–2.0 °C above pre-industrial temperature levels) if extreme thermal events do not occur more frequently than every 8 years. This estimation may be considered optimistic in the light of the 5 year return period of extreme thermal events suggested by Frieler
