<p id="Par26" class="p">An array of corals species with different combinations of the three traits (i) growth rate, (ii) susceptibility to bleaching (i.e. heat-tolerance) and (iii) competitiveness was generated at the beginning of each simulation. Each coral species was given a total of 100 resource units (RUs) which were randomly distributed to specify the strength of the three traits (i.e. a species could maximize the capacity of one trait or of allocate resources in different combinations and proportions of either two or all three traits). Coral species in the model can thus be subdivided into 4 groups; i.e. (a) Heat tolerant, (b) highly competitive, (c) fast growing, and (d) those with balanced (mixed) traits (Appendix
