<p id="Par25" class="p">In our model, coral colonies were individual entities that grew, reproduced, and interacted with their direct neighbours. Each of these activities was influenced by environmental conditions. The characteristics of the corals were representative of massive and branching morphologies which differed in certain life history traits (Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The surface factor (as explained below) was deemed to be higher for branching corals and ultimately determined growth rates and the ability of corals to reproduce by fragmentation.
