<p id="Par27" class="p">The surface factor determines the compactness of the coral. We assume a hemispherical surface area for massive corals which is then multiplied by the surface factor to account for three-dimensional structure of branching corals (see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> for values). The surface factor was theoretically set to achieve a 3-D structure comparable to rugosity measurements in coral reefs and to account for differences between massive and branching corals

 </sup>. In turn, the surface factor determines (i) the lateral extension rate, as a compact colony skeleton structure does not extend into space as fast as a branching one, (ii) the probability of being removed during a mechanical disturbance event, and (iii) the probability of producing fragments that may subsequently settle and grow into autonomous colonies.
