<p id="Par24" class="p">We used an individual-based model to simulate a benthic coral reef community with massive and branching coral species and algae. To test the influence of changing environmental conditions we utilized various scenarios in which different coral species and algae compete for space on a two-dimensional, continuous simulation area (50 × 50 m). The substrate was defined as suitable for the indiscriminate settlement of corals and algae. Organisms within this space grew every month, dynamically interacting with neighbouring organisms and their environment. The community is exposed to thermal events which can induce bleaching in individual coral colonies, as well as mechanical disturbance events which remove affected colonies from the simulation area. The model was programmed in Java and the analysis of results was conducted with R Statistical Software. The source code is available on GitHub (
