<p id="Par30" class="p">A crucial factor for determining 
 <italic class="italic">DHD</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">HR</italic> is the number of years from which 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> is calculated. In the original method a base period of 11 years was used to calculate 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>
 </sup>. If 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> is calculated using a rolling climatology, the period of time that is used for the calculation of 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> is also the systemâ€™s response time in adapting to changing temperature dynamics

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>
 </sup>. In biological terms, using fewer years to calculate 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> mimics a faster adaptation rate of coral communities; i.e. assuming overall increasing temperatures with a shorter base for calculating LMST the difference between LMST and actual daily temperatures, and hence the values for DHD and HR decrease. In this study, we calculated 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> using base periods ranging from 10 to 50 years in order to estimate the consequences of different adaptation rates for coral communities.
