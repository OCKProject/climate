<p id="Par31" class="p">Macroalgae were implemented as individuals, which occupy space and can displace coral recruits â‰¤4 months old. Macroalgae occupied free space fastest, but were then slowly displaced by corals (see also Appendix: Macroalgae and coral-algae interactions). In simulations we used algae as coral competitors, but did not evaluate their influence on coral performance, as they affected all species equally.</p>
