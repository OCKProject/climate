<p id="Par33" class="p">We assessed how environmental conditions determined survival of traits and shaped coral communities within the simulation environment (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The baseline scenario (Scenario 1) explored conditions similar to those of previous decades when thermal stress did not play a big role in the community dynamics of coral reefs. In order to understand the impact of mass coral bleaching and mortality, this baseline scenario was compared to those where thermal stress was significant (Scenarios 2–3). In each simulation run a total of 20 coral species (10 massive and 10 branching) were included with pairs of species (massive and branching) sharing the same combination of traits in relative terms; absolute values for traits differ between massive and branching species in each trait combination pair (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). For each scenario setting we simulated 10 different combinations of species (amounting to 200 species in total) and ran 20 replicates for each of these combinations of species with varying initial trait combinations.
