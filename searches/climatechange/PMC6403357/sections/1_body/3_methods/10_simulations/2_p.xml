<p id="Par34" class="p">Randomly sized coral colonies of all species were randomly distributed over the simulation area at the beginning of a simulation. Individual colonies can be overgrown to a certain extent, so that total coral cover may exceed 100%, but overgrowing branching corals are displaced if area overlap is too large. At the start of the simulations, massive corals outcompeted branching corals that occupied the same space; thus coral cover of massive species was higher in initial stages of the simulations. Over time, this effect was compensated by higher growth rates of branching corals, which grew into free space after disturbance events.</p>
