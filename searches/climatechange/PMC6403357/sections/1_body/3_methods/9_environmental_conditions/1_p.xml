<p id="Par32" class="p">The climatology (1997–2010) used in the present study originates from Chumbe Island, Zanzibar (C. Muhando, Centre for Marine Science, Zanzibar, unpublished data). This time series includes the 1998 El Niño mass bleaching event, when water temperatures approximately 2 °C above the long-term average (in March) caused severe coral bleaching and mortality across the Western Indian Ocean. To simulate longer time spans, single years of the data set were concatenated in a random order. Temperature data for 1998 was treated differently, as the high temperatures for this year were an extreme thermal event. These data were excluded from the main climatology and used to simulate the occurrence of extreme thermal events, which were inserted as a fully controlled component of the scenarios (see below). Disturbance events were included as an external mechanical impact, which killed all organisms in a disturbed area, and thus created space for settlement. In the scenarios mechanical disturbance events occurred either (i) never, or (ii) as smaller (2–4 m in diameter) and larger (5–10 m in diameter) events, which occurred every 6 and 12 months, respectively.</p>
