<p id="Par28" class="p">Each individual coral colony within the simulation grows with a species-specific growth rate, corresponding to the trait combinations, as described above (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). As it has been shown that competition among corals affects growth rates of competitors
