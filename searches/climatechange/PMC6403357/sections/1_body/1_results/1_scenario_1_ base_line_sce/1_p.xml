<p id="Par8" class="p">Direct competition between coral species played an important role when simulated reefs were undisturbed by extreme thermal events and mechanical disturbance events (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In these conditions trait diversity within the community stayed high (Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) and nearly all species survived. The occurrence of mechanical disturbance events favoured branching corals when total initial coral cover was low (20%), but not when initial cover was high (100%). Furthermore, the occurrence of mechanical disturbance levels favoured fast-growing coral species over competitive ones.
