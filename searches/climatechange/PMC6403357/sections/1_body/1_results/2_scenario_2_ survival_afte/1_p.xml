<p id="Par9" class="p">In the absence of extreme thermal events and mechanical disturbances, the trait diversity within the coral community remained high (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) and massive corals dominated over branching ones by a ratio of 10:1. In the absence of extreme thermal events, mechanical disturbance provided relatively favourable conditions for branching corals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Species diversity decreased with increasing frequencies of extreme thermal events (Appendix 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). This effect was more pronounced when mechanical disturbance also occurred (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). At the same time there was a shift to fast-growing species in massive corals and temperature-resistant species in branching corals, at the expense of species which mainly invested in competitive traits.
