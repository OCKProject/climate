<p id="Par14" class="p">Here, we found that the potential adaptation rate needed to be 0.2 to 0.22 °C per decade to allow for survival of ~20% of initial coral cover by the end of the century with a 2 °C (RCP 4.5) temperature increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). To survive a 4 °C temperature increase the community would have to adapt at about 0.45 °C per decade to sustain itself. For fast-adapting communities, the magnitude of extreme thermal events was buffered. Therefore, even with a 4 °C temperature increase, fast-adapting communities still maintained 20% of initial cover, of which heat-tolerant branching species covered ~15% and fast growing massive species ~5% (Appendix
