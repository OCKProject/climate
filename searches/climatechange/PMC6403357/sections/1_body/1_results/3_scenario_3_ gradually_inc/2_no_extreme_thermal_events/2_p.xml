<p id="Par12" class="p">On the other hand, coral cover declined tremendously for slow-adapting communities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). Half of the coral cover was lost with a 1 °C temperature increase (RCP 2.6) and, with only a third of the species surviving, diversity was lower than for fast-adapting communities under highest simulated temperature increase of 4 °C. By the end of the simulation these communities mainly consisted of heat-tolerant branching species and to a lesser extent of fast-growing and heat-tolerant massive species. At a temperature increase of 2 °C (RCP 4.5) only 5 heat-tolerant species of 200 initial species survived for the entire simulation period of 90 years. The amount and magnitude of bleaching events steadily increased over the course of the simulation and after 70 years all massive species were extinct. If the temperature increased ≥3 °C, bleaching and mortality events became so frequent and strong that none of the coral species survived longer than 50–60 years.
