<p id="Par11" class="p">Even simulated temperature increases of 4 °C (RCP 8.5) above current conditions did not lead to mass coral bleaching in fast-adapting coral communities in the absence of extreme thermal events (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Coral cover was ~60% of initial cover and an average of 90 of the initial 200 species survived (H = 3.81). Nevertheless, with faster temperature increases, community composition shifted from fast-growing to more heat-tolerant species.
