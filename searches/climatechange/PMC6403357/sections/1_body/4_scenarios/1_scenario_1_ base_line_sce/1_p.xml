<p id="Par36" class="p">In these scenarios we assessed the competition between neighbouring coral colonies with and without mechanical disturbance events. The simulation temperature scheme was kept on low oscillations without extreme thermal events, so no bleaching occurred throughout the simulation runs. To analyse the influence of space availability, we ran scenarios with initial total coral cover of 20% and 100%, i.e. with each species occupying 1% and 5% of the total area, respectively.</p>
