<p id="Par37" class="p">In order to analyse trait performance within a stressed community, we simulated reef conditions with extreme thermal events (i.e. El Ni√±o years) recurring at a constant interval of 2, 4, 6, 8 or 10 years, or never in the control scenario. For Scenario 2, initial coral cover was 100% and each species initially covered 5% of the simulation area.</p>
