<p id="Par38" class="p">In this scenario sea temperature was gradually increased (in 0.5 °C increments) to reach 0.5–4 °C above current conditions by the end of this century. This was achieved by adding the respective increment to the generated temperature scenarios, thus keeping the original variability of the climatology. An increase of 0.5–1.5 °C corresponds to RCP 2.6 for the Indian Ocean, while an increase of 2.5–4 °C corresponds to RCP 8.5

 </sup>. In these scenarios, we also analysed the influence of the adaptation potential of coral species by simulating different response times (10 to 50 years) to changing temperature dynamics (i.e. mimicking fast adaptation by using 
 <italic class="italic">LMST</italic> based on 10 preceding years, and a slower response using LMST for a 50 year period). In all cases, initial coral cover was 100% and each species initially covered 5% of the simulation area. All scenario runs were assessed with and without the effect of recurring extreme thermal events in 8 year intervals, which is in the range of estimations for current intervals of extreme thermal events
