<p class="p">A two‐way cluster analysis was performed to describe groups of samples with similar faunal compositions (Q‐mode) and groups of taxa that tend to co‐occur (R‐mode). The clustering algorithm used agglomerate nesting, coupled with Ward's method, which adds samples to existing clusters that minimize the total sum of squares. Ward's method tends to produce dendrograms with well‐defined clusters (Legendre &amp; Legendre
