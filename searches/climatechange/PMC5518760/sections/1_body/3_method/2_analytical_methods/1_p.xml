<p class="p">Before numerical analysis, all taxa occurring in only one sample and all samples containing only one taxon were removed to prevent the distortion they create in multivariate analyses. The resulting culled dataset contains 157 samples, 70 taxa and 8466 individuals. Of the species, 49 are bivalve, with 8 gastropods, 6 serpulids, 5 crinoids, 1 belemnite and 1 brachiopod species. The culled data set is also dominated by bivalves, which represent 85.3% of all individuals. The median sample size is 40 individuals (minimum of 11, maximum of 306). Prior to multivariate analysis, a percent transformation within samples was performed, followed by a log transformation to lessen the dominating influence of the most abundant taxa.</p>
