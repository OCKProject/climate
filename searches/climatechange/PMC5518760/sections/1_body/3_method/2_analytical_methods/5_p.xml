Pairwise comparisons of groups of samples from the same depositional environment (e.g. shallow subtidal) but different depositional sequences (e.g. J1a vs J2) were used to produce a distance matrix. Jaccard dissimilarity (Jaccard

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1957</xref>) was used for relative‐abundance data. Similarities were calculated using vegdist() function of the vegan package in R, but were inverted such to express similarity where a value of 1.0 indicates identical groups and 0.0 represents completely different groups. The t.test() function in R was used to generate 95% confidence intervals on similarity. Similarity was calculated only for environments containing more than two samples per sequence.
