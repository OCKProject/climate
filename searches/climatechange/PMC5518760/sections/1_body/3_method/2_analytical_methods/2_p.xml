<p class="p">Data were ordinated using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), a useful ordination method for detecting patterns of co‐occurrence among taxa as well as ecological gradients (Legendre &amp; Legendre 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Ordinations used Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, three axes, 100 restarts to prevent reaching a local optimum, and weighted averaging to calculate taxon scores. NMDS ordination was performed with the metaMDS() function in the vegan package of R (R Core Team

This function rotates the NMDS solution via principal components analysis such that NMDS axis 1 reflects the principal source of variation, and so on, as is characteristic of eigenvalue methods. Detrended correspondence analysis was also performed, but NMDS results better segregated samples of clearly different composition, as is sometimes the case (Patzkowsky &amp; Holland

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). NMDS ordinations were also performed separately for Middle Jurassic (J1a–J3) and Upper Jurassic (J4–J5) samples, following the same protocols as in the ordination of the total data set. Stress values were 0.08 for the NMDS ordination of the entire dataset, and respectively, 0.08 and 0.09 for the Middle and Upper Jurassic ordinations, values that suggest little distortion (Clarke &amp; Warwick
