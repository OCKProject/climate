<p class="p">Fossils were identified to species wherever possible, although only genus‐ and family‐level identifications were possible in some cases. The minimum number of individuals was calculated following standard approaches (see Patzkowsky &amp; Holland 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), except for echinoids and crinoids. As these commonly disarticulate into numerous ossicles, the number of echinoderm individuals was estimated by dividing the number of ossicles and spines by 100. The total dataset contains 184 samples, 120 taxa and 11347 individuals, and includes 82 species of bivalve, 15 gastropod species, 9 echinoderm species (crinoids and echinoids), 7 serpulid species, 2 brachiopod species, 2 bryozoan species, 1 belemnite species, 1 coral species and 1 decapod species (Danise &amp; Holland 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Unusually for the Jurassic, ammonites are rarely encountered in the study area and were not present in any of our samples. The data set is dominated by bivalves, which represent 88.6% of all individuals.
