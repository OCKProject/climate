<p class="p">At each locality, stratigraphical columns were logged for lithology, bedding, sedimentary structures, and trace fossils. These were interpreted in terms of depositional environment, and stratigraphical intervals were assigned to specific sedimentary facies and depositional sequences (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Two main depositional systems are distinguished, a siliciclastic shelf and a carbonate ramp. The siliciclastic system contains facies representing four progressively landward environments: offshore (deeper than storm wave base), offshore transition, shoreface (shallower than fair‐weather wave base) and tidal channel (from a tidal estuary system). The carbonate ramp system comprises facies from six depositional environments: offshore (below storm wave base), deep subtidal (between storm wave base and fair‐weather wave base), open shallow subtidal (shallower than fair‐weather wave base), restricted shallow subtidal, ooid shoal and peritidal. Of the eight total depositional sequences, only six (J1a, J2, J2a, J3, J4, J5) are fossiliferous. Some sedimentary environments were typically unfossiliferous (e.g. shoreface) or poorly fossiliferous (e.g. restricted shallow subtidal, peritidal), each sequence tends to preserve either the siliciclastic system or the carbonate system but not both, and not all facies within a given system and sequence are exposed within the study area. As a result, it is not possible to sample the time‐environment matrix completely, as is often the case in the fossil record (Smith
