<p class="p">Faunal censuses were obtained from marine rocks of the Gypsum Spring, Sundance and Twin Creek formations at 44 localities in Wyoming, Montana and South Dakota during 2014–2016 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Censuses were conducted on bedding surfaces or vertical surfaces in the field, and by collecting samples of approximately 7.5 l, which were counted in the laboratory. In all cases, representative samples were collected to establish species‐level identifications.
