<p class="p">A water depth gradient is also recognizable in the ordination of J4 and J5 sequences, again along axis 1, indicating that water depth is the primary source of variation in community composition (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>E). Tidal channel samples have the lowest axis 1 scores, offshore transition samples have intermediate axis 1 scores, and offshore samples have the highest axis 1 scores. The only two carbonate samples, both from J4, plot at intermediate axis 1 scores but the highest axis 2 scores.
