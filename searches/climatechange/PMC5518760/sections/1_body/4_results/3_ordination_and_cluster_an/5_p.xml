<p class="p">As for the Middle Jurassic, Upper Jurassic biofacies are also distributed along a depth gradient, with overlap of many of the biofacies in ordination space (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>F). Biofacies U7 and U8 have the highest axis 1 scores and are interpreted as deeper‐water biofacies, whereas U1 and U3 have the lowest axis 1 scores and are interpreted to be shallower‐water biofacies. All remaining biofacies (U2, U4, U5, U6) occupy intermediate positions. With a few exceptions (e.g. U3), most biofacies overlap in ordination space to some extent, indicating the gradient nature of community composition.
