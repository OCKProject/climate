<p class="p">Many of the biofacies in J4â€“J5 are also restricted to particular depositional environments or sequences. For example, biofacies U2 is limited to the J4 offshore transition, U3 to J5 tidal channels, and U6 and U7 to the J4 offshore. Biofacies U8 has almost the same distribution as U6 and U7, but was also found in one J5 tidal channel sample. The remaining three biofacies are more broadly distributed. Biofacies U1 occurs mostly in the J4 offshore transition and ooid shoal, but also rarely in the offshore. Biofacies U4 occurs in tidal channel, offshore and offshore transition facies of sequence J4 and J5. Biofacies U5 occurs in the J4 offshore and in J5 tidal channels.</p>
