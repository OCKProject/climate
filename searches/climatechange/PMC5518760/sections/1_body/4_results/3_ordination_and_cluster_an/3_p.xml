<p class="p">Five of these eight biofacies are dominated by a single taxon, as seen in the Middle Jurassic sequences (biofacies U1, U4, U5, U7, U8: Table

 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). These biofacies also have low richness (&lt;4), and evenness (&lt;0.4; Table 
 <xref rid="pala12278-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The other three biofacies (biofacies U2, U3, U6) have greater evenness (&gt;0.4) and generally greater richness (two of the three have richness &gt;6).
