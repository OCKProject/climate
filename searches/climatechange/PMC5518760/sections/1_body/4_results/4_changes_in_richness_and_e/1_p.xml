<p class="p">When the data are binned by depositional sequence and environment (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>A), the highest rarefied richness and evenness occurs in the deep subtidal and open shallow subtidal of sequence J1a and in the offshore and offshore transition of sequence J4. The open shallow subtidal of J2 also has high evenness but intermediate richness. In contrast, sequence J2a contains many of the lowest values of richness and evenness, both in samples from carbonate (deep subtidal and offshore) and siliciclastic (offshore and offshore transition) systems. These low values are comparable to those of the restricted shallow subtidal, which would be expected to have low diversity because of its hypersalinity (Clement &amp; Holland
