<p class="p">Ordination of the J1a–J3 samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>A, B) also reproduces a water depth gradient largely along axis 1, with offshore and deep subtidal samples at low axis 1 scores, and shallower samples (open shallow subtidal, restricted shallow subtidal, ooid shoal, peritidal) at higher axis 1 scores. Siliciclastic‐system J2a samples from offshore and offshore transition environments are the exception to this pattern, and they have high axis 1 scores, a pattern consistent with the ordination of all samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Samples also segregate by age, with the oldest samples (J1a) having relatively high scores on both axis 1 and axis 2, and J2a samples having relatively low scores on both axes. These differences again reflect turnover in the composition of deep subtidal communities. J2 samples tend to have high axis 1 scores, but low axis 2 scores, and the few J3 samples have intermediate scores. These differences in where samples of a given age plot mostly reflect differences in the environments preserved in each sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
