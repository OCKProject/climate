<p class="p">Eight biofacies were identified with two‐way cluster analysis (Fig.

 <xref rid="pala12278-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), and samples in the ordination were coded by biofacies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>C) to show the relationships among these biofacies and how they relate to the main environmental gradient.
