<p class="p">Several J1a–J3 biofacies are limited to particular combinations of depositional sequence and environment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>B, C). For example, biofacies M2 is limited to carbonate offshore facies of J2a; M5 is found only in the restricted shallow subtidal of J1a; and M8 is present exclusively in the deep subtidal of sequence J2a. Biofacies M6 occurs only in the deep subtidal and shallow subtidal of J1a, and the diverse bivalve biofacies M7 is almost as restricted but is also found in one deep subtidal sample from the J2a.
