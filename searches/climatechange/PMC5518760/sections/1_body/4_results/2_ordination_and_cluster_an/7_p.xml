<p class="p">Biofacies are arrayed with overlap along the depth gradient (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>C). Biofacies M2, M6, and M8 have relatively low axis 1 scores and therefore are interpreted as relatively deeper‐water biofacies. Biofacies M3, M4, and M7 occupy intermediate positions along the depth gradient, and biofacies M1 and M5 have the highest axis 1 scores and are interpreted as relatively shallow‐water biofacies. Most biofacies overlap in ordination space, except for M2, M5, and M8, consistent with these biofacies representing somewhat artificial divisions of a biotic gradient, rather than discrete community types, an interpretation consistent with the substantial taxonomic overlap in the composition of these biofacies (Table
