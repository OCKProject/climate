<p class="p">When coded by depositional sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>A), Middle Jurassic samples have low to intermediate axis 1 scores, and Upper Jurassic samples have intermediate to high axis 1 scores. Coding by lithological system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>B) reveals that samples with low axis 1 scores are from carbonate systems and those with high axis 1 scores are from siliciclastic systems, reflecting the long‐term transition within the Sundance Seaway (McMullen

In detail, sequences J1a and J2 are exclusively composed of carbonates, J2a contains both carbonates and siliciclastics, J3 only includes carbonates, and J4 and J5 are exclusively siliciclastic, except from three samples from a J4 ooid shoal.
