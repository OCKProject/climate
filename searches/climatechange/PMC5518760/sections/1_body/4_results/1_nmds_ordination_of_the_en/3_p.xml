<p class="p">Coding by depositional environment reveals a second pattern superimposed on this overall trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>C). Carbonate deep‐water samples (offshore and deep subtidal) have low axis 1 scores, while deep‐water siliciclastic samples (offshore) have the highest axis 1 scores. The shallowest environments of both carbonate and siliciclastic systems (open and restricted shallow subtidal, ooid shoal, peritidal, tidal channel, offshore transition) have intermediate axis 1 scores and plot in the middle of the ordination. Although this pattern indicates that water depth is expressed on axis 1, as is common in ordinations of marine invertebrates (Patzkowsky &amp; Holland 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), it deviates in an important way from the typical pattern in which deep‐water and shallow‐water samples lie at opposite ends of axis 1. The pattern in this data indicates that shallow‐water samples are similar in taxonomic composition, regardless of their age or whether they derive from a carbonate or siliciclastic system. Furthermore, the strongest compositional difference in the entire data set is between deep‐water samples from the older carbonate systems and the younger deep‐water siliciclastic systems.
