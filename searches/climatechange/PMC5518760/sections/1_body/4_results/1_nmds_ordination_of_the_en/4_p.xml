 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Within carbonate systems, the older J1a have large axis 2 scores, whereas the younger J2a samples have low axis 2 scores. J2 and J3 samples have intermediate scores. Among J2a samples, those from the deep subtidal have smaller axis 2 scores than those from the offshore. Within the open shallow subtidal samples, samples from the J1a and J2 sequences overlap along axis 2, indicating little faunal turnover in the open shallow subtidal of these sequences. In siliciclastic systems, offshore and offshore transition samples of the J4 sequence and tidal channel samples of the J5 sequence have highly variable axis 2 scores at low to intermediate values. This pattern suggests that a combination of temporal changes and lateral variations within the environments preserved along the onshore–offshore depth gradient (
