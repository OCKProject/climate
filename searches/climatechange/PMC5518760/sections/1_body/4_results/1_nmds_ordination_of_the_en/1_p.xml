<p class="p">The NMDS ordination followed by PCA rotation places samples within a space such that the relative positions of samples reflect their similarity and such that axis 1 of the ordination explains the greatest amount of variation, followed by axis 2, and so on. Coding the samples by depositional sequence, lithological system, and depositional environment is used to interpret the sources of variation underlying these axes (Fig.Â
