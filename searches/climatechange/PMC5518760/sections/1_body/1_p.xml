<p class="p">Here we present a species‐level study of marine benthic community response to sea‐level and climate change from the Middle–Upper Jurassic Sundance Seaway of the western United States. Globally, the Jurassic was characterized by rapidly increasing ecospace utilization and biological diversification, and by the origin and radiation of the major groups that constitute modern marine ecosystems (Vermeij
