<p class="p">The use of quantitative abundance data integrated within a time–environment framework reveals the change of benthic communities of the Middle–Upper Jurassic Sundance Seaway from its opening to its closure, over a time interval of about 13 myr. The Sundance Seaway is characterized by communities with low richness and high dominance, unlike most Jurassic communities worldwide. This diversity structure may have resulted from the unusual physiography of the seaway, whose sole connection to the Pacific Ocean was about 2000 km north of its southern end. This probably fostered strong gradients along the axis of the seaway in temperature and salinity that hindered the immigration of species from the open ocean.</p>
