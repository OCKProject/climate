<p class="p">Communities within the Sundance Seaway were arrayed along a water depth gradient that changed over the history of the seaway. In the Middle Jurassic (Bajocian–Callovian sequences J1a–J3) benthic communities occupied a carbonate ramp, but in the Upper Jurassic (Oxfordian sequences J4 and J5), communities were developed along a siliciclastic shelf. This transition to a siliciclastic system triggered turnover in the benthic fauna, with greater turnover in offshore environments relative to onshore environments. Higher turnover in more seaward areas is present not only at the Middle to Upper Jurassic transition, but also among successive depositional sequences in general. The higher resilience of onshore communities to sea‐level variations and to the switch from a carbonate system to a siliciclastic one was controlled by a few abundant eurytopic species (e.g.

 <italic class="italic">Meleagrinella curta</italic>). Lower stability in offshore settings was controlled by the greater stenotopy of species (e.g. species of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Gryphaea</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Camptonectes</italic>), which underwent higher turnover through time.
