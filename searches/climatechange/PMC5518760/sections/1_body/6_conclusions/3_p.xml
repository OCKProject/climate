<p class="p">These results, based on an ecological analysis of relative abundance patterns, contrast with taxonomic‐based approaches and indicate the need for ecological studies to complement taxonomic studies of macroevolutionary events. This study shows how a stratigraphic palaeobiological approach is essential for understanding the link between environmental and faunal gradients, and for understanding the long‐term changes in these gradients over time that produce the local stratigraphical pattern of changes in community composition.</p>
