<p class="p">The higher resilience of onshore biofacies to third‐order sea‐level fluctuations and to the change from carbonate to siliciclastic systems was driven by a few, dominant, eurytopic species. Abundant species like 
 <italic class="italic">Liostrea strigilecula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Meleagrinella curta</italic> were eurytopic and not restricted to a single facies, sequence or depositional environment, and they were long‐lived, persisting from the opening to the closing of the Seaway (from J1a to J5). Turnover, which mostly occurred at the species level, occurred mainly in taxa adapted to a more restricted range of habitats, and these species were more abundant in more seaward settings. For instance, the species 
 <italic class="italic">Gryphaea planoconvexa</italic>, common in deep and shallow subtidal environments of J1a (biofacies M6), was replaced by 
 <italic class="italic">G. nebrascensis</italic> in the deep subtidal of J2a (biofacies M8), and by 
 <italic class="italic">Gryphaea</italic> sp. in the offshore of J4 (biofacies U7). The pectinid 
 <italic class="italic">Camptonectes</italic> is present in open shallow subtidal, ooid shoal and peritidal environments of J1a to J2a as 
 <italic class="italic">C. platessiformis</italic> (biofacies M4), in deep and shallow subtidal environments of J1a to J3 as 
 <italic class="italic">C. stygius</italic> (biofacies M3–M6), in offshore carbonate facies of J1a as 
 <italic class="italic">Camptonectes</italic> sp. (biofacies M2), and in offshore siliciclastic facies of J4 as 
 <italic class="italic">Camptonectes bellistriatus</italic>.
