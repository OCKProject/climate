<p class="p">Ordination of faunal censuses from the Sundance Seaway demonstrate the sustained similarity of shallow‐water biofacies and the greater turnover in deeper‐water biofacies. This onshore–offshore variation in turnover is observed both between successive third‐order depositional sequences within the same depositional system (carbonate or siliciclastic), and in the transition from the carbonate system to the siliciclastic system. Both the Jaccard and the Bray–Curtis similarity measures indicate that taxonomic similarity decreased from onshore to offshore in successive third‐order depositional sequences, although similarity values are low for both onshore and offshore environments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Turnover is higher offshore in carbonate (open shallow subtidal versus deep subtidal environments) as well as siliciclastic systems (offshore vs offshore transition environments), with J1a and J2a deep subtidal environments having the lowest levels of mean similarity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). These patterns suggest that onshore communities were more resilient to perturbations caused by third‐order sea‐level changes compared with offshore communities. At the same time, onshore communities were also more resilient to the switch from carbonate to siliciclastic deposition at the Middle–Upper Jurassic transition. This is shown by the ordination of all samples, where onshore samples from carbonate and siliciclastic systems plot one close to the other, indicating higher taxonomic similarity compared to offshore ones, which plot at the opposite ends of NMDS axis 1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
