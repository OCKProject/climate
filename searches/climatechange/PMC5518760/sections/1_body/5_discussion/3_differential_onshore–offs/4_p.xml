<p class="p">Our results partly conflict with a previous interpretation of faunal stasis in the Jurassic Sundance Seaway (Tang &amp; Bottjer 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). The authors, using mostly presence–absence data, and without differentiating between depositional environments, found that many bivalve species and associations persisted through sea‐level and environmental changes, through depositional units and stratigraphical breaks, with no turnover events. They attributed this stability to the environmental conditions of the Jurassic Sundance Seaway that selected for generalist taxa capable of withstanding environmental disturbances and persisting for long intervals of time (Tang &amp; Bottjer 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Our analysis also finds that many species are persistent through the history of the Sundance Seaway, but mainly in onshore settings. Faunas of offshore settings change not only with the switch from a carbonate system to a siliciclastic one, but also from one depositional sequence to the next. Recognizing this turnover requires the use of quantitative abundance data, comparisons within sedimentologically defined depositional environments, and a sequence stratigraphic framework.
