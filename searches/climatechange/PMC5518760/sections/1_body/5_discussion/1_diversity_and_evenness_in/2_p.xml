<p class="p">This low evenness in the Sundance Seaway is reflected in the structure of biofacies, which are often dominated by one or two species that constitute 60â€“95% of the community. Some of these species (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Liostrea strigilecula</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Meleagrinella curta</italic>) are found in multiple biofacies, depositional environments, and sequences, and they persisted from the initiation to the final filling of the Seaway. Other species are closely associated with a single depositional environment or sequence, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Staffinella</italic>? sp. in the restricted shallow subtidal of J1a (biofacies M5) and 
 <italic class="italic">Gryphaea nebrascensis</italic> in the deep shallow subtidal of J2a (biofacies M8). The few relatively diverse biofacies typically span adjacent depositional environments along an environmental gradient.
