<p class="p">The southern Sundance Seaway records benthic communities from a wide array of depositional environments, ranging from restricted coastal settings to fully open‐marine conditions. Diversity and evenness patterns are controlled in large part by depositional environment, with open‐marine communities showing higher richness and evenness than communities from restricted or marginal environments, such as the restricted shallow subtidal or tidal channel (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). In addition, richness and evenness tend to be higher in carbonate systems than in siliciclastic systems. One exception to these patterns is sequence J2a, which has low richness and evenness even in open marine facies, and in both carbonate and siliciclastic systems.
