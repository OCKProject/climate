 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Other factors could also have contributed to the low richness and evenness of the Sundance fauna. In particular, the peculiar palaeogeography of the Sundance Seaway, with its single entrance located at high latitude, 2000 km from its southern terminus, coupled with its shallow depth, could have hindered the immigration of species from the open ocean, thus reducing the diversity of body and trace fossils (Tang &amp; Bottjer
