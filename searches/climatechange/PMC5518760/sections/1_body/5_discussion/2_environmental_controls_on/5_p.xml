<p class="p">This switch in depositional system was likely to have been driven by the gradual northward migration of the North American plate during the Jurassic, which moved the study area out of the subtropical latitudes that fostered an arid climate and carbonate–evaporite deposition, and into one with progressively more humid climates (Johnson

By the end of the Jurassic, the region also moved from the belt of easterly tropical trade winds to the belt of the cooler westerlies in the middle latitudes (Kocurek &amp; Dott

This shift in depositional system and the accompanying faunal change may have also been enhanced by climate cooling, recorded at the Callovian–Oxfordian boundary interval in the northern hemisphere. Oxygen‐isotope data from English and Russian belemnites indicate a drop in temperature commencing in the latest Callovian (Jenkyns

Because regional facies analysis indicates sea‐level fall across the stage boundary, it has been suggested that this interval records build‐up of continental polar ice (Dromart
