<p class="p">Over the entire marine history of the Sundance Seaway (~13 myr), the main environmental factor controlling the distribution of faunal community is the change in depositional system, from carbonate to siliciclastic. In the ordination of the complete data set (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), Middle Jurassic samples (J1a–J3) plot separately from Upper Jurassic ones (J4–J5) along axis 1, showing that the main ecological transition occurred around the Callovian to Oxfordian boundary. A previous ordination of a much smaller Sundance data set (McMullen 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) also identified this transition as the primary factor controlling the distribution of taxa through time. In our analysis, the only exception to this temporal trend is the presence of siliciclastic offshore and offshore transition samples in the Bathonian sequence J2a, which have a similar taxonomic composition to offshore transition samples of sequence J4 and plot with Upper Jurassic samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). These samples all belong to a

 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), which persisted across the J4 unconformity, probably the longest hiatus in the history of the Seaway (at least 2 myr: Imlay 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>). The importance of the J4 transition is also reflected in the lithostratigraphical nomenclature of the Sundance Seaway throughout the region. In Wyoming, the Sundance is often informally divided into an upper and lower Sundance across this boundary (Kvale

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). In Montana, this boundary separates the underlying carbonate‐dominated Rierdon Formation from the overlying siliciclastic‐dominated Swift Formation (Imlay
