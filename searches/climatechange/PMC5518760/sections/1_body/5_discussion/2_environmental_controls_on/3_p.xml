<p class="p">Water depth is interpreted as one of the most important factors describing the distribution of marine benthic organisms, as shown in multiple studies from modern and ancient settings (e.g. Scarponi &amp; Kowalewski

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This pattern is caused by the correlation with water depth of the many physical factors that control the structure and taxonomic composition of level‐bottom communities, such as temperature, salinity, water energy, substrate consistency, and grain size (Patzkowsky &amp; Holland 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Such a relationship between assemblages and water depth can only be stable over geological time if the relationships of environmental factors with water depth remain consistent over broad geographical ranges and long spans of time. At larger spatial and longer temporal scales, other factors can control faunal distributions, such as provincialism (Patzkowsky &amp; Holland 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). In the Sundance Seaway, the onshore–offshore gradient is preserved through four third‐order depositional sequences in the Middle Jurassic, (J1a, J2, J2a, J3), which span an interval of time of ~5 myr. In the Upper Jurassic, a relatively consistent gradient is present through two third‐order depositional sequences (J4 and J5) that span the entire Oxfordian (~6 myr).
