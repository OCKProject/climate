<p class="p">As in our case‐study, another regional‐level palaeoecological analysis also found that a shift from a carbonate‐dominated to a siliciclastic‐dominated system was the main controlling factor in the ordination of samples (Bonelli &amp; Patzkowsky 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). On larger spatial and temporal scales substrate affinity of benthic organisms, and the availability of carbonate versus siliciclastic lithology through time, is considered to be a main driver in diversity and turnover dynamics, both in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic (Miller &amp; Connolly

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In particular, a study on the environmental affinity of Palaeozoic genera has shown that differences in dynamic between carbonate and siliciclastic lovers act especially on relatively short time scales (&lt;5 myr), and could be driven by brief environmental perturbations that preferentially affect carbonate systems (Foote 
 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Carbonate systems are volatile, being sensitive to changes in temperature, nutrient input, as well as siliciclastic supply. Siliciclastics in particular can inhibit or dilute carbonate production. Increases in terrigenous sediment supply, which can be driven by sea‐level fall, tectonic uplift, and climate change, can result in the selective elimination of carbonate environments relative to siliciclastics, and drive ecological and evolutionary change (Peters
