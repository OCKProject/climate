<p class="p">The Gypsum Spring and Sundance formations are exposed in Wyoming along the flanks of Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic uplifts, including the Black Hills, Pryor Mountains, Bighorn Mountains, Wind River Mountains, Wyoming Range and Laramie Mountains. The Gypsum Spring Formation, with a maximum thickness of about 80 m, was deposited on a north‐westward‐dipping mixed evaporate–carbonate–siliciclastic ramp, with depositional environments that include distal ooid shoals, open shallow subtidal, restricted shallow subtidal, peritidal, salinas and desert mud flat to sabkha (Clement &amp; Holland
