<p class="p">The Twin Creek Formation is exposed in the Wyoming Range of westernmost Wyoming and eastern Idaho, and comprises a thick sequence of marine carbonates and shales deposited on westward‐dipping mixed evaporate–carbonate ramp. The Twin Creek thickens to the west, where it reaches a maximum thickness of about 700 m in the Twin Creek Trough. The facies models of McMullen

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) can be readily applied to the Twin Creek Formation, with the addition of carbonate offshore and deep subtidal facies not present to the east. The Twin Creek Formation is subdivided into seven members that were deposited in spectrum of environments ranging from desert mudflat and sabkha to carbonate offshore (Fig.
