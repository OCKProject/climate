<p class="p">The Sundance Formation is approximately 100 m thick, and records cyclical deposition on a north‐westward‐dipping mixed siliciclastic–carbonate system. The complex alternation of mudstones, limestones and sandstones has led to a complex lithostratigraphical nomenclature (Imlay

 <xref rid="pala12278-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) divided the Sundance Formation into six members. The Canyon Springs and lower Hulett members are each dominated by carbonate rocks, deposited mainly in the shallow subtidal and on ooid shoals (McMullen

The Stockade Beaver Shale was deposited on a mixed carbonate–siliciclastic shelf, with offshore, carbonate mudstone facies to the west, and siliciclastic offshore and offshore transition facies to the east. The upper Hulett Member is a siliciclastic incised‐valley fill capped by transgressive ooid shoal facies. The Redwater Shale Member was deposited on a wave‐dominated siliciclastic shelf, and the Windy Hill Sandstone was deposited in a tidal estuary. The Windy Hill grades upward through progressive loss of tidal influence into overlying coastal plain deposits of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation (lower Oxfordian to lower Tithonian: Imlay
