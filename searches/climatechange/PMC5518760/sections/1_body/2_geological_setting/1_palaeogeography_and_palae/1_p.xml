<p class="p">The study interval spans the Middle to Upper Jurassic (Bajocian to Oxfordian; ~170–155 Ma) marine and continental deposits from siliciclastic, carbonate, and evaporite systems in the Sundance Seaway of Wyoming and adjacent states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The Sundance Seaway developed in an elongated, retro‐arc foreland basin connected to the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), with the Cordilleran volcanic arc to the west and the North American craton to the east (Peterson

Thrust faulting to the west during the Middle Jurassic created a foredeep in Utah, eastern Idaho and western Wyoming, within which the Twin Creek Formation was deposited (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). To the east of this foredeep, a west to north‐westward‐facing ramp developed, upon which the Gypsum Spring and Sundance formations were deposited (Fig. 
 <xref rid="pala12278-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
