  <p class="p">Time–environment plot showing number of samples grouped by depositional sequence and environment. Combinations lacking samples generally reflect those sequences containing either the siliciclastic system or the carbonate system, as well as the unavailability of particular depositional environments in certain sequences (e.g. shoreface environments are absent in some sequences and are unfossiliferous where they do occur). The J4 ooid shoal is an ephemeral transgressive carbonate environment within a siliciclastic system. 
   <italic class="italic">Symbols</italic>: – depositional environment not present; • depositional environment unfossiliferous; blank, depositional system not present.
