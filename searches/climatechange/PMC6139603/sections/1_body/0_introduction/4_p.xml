<p id="pr0030" class="p">The present study seeks to assess the impacts of climate change on the hydrological regime of the Abay Basin in the 21st century, using statistically robust globally modelled climate data that possess a climate change component. To date, research on basin characteristics, hydrology, and climatic conditions in the upper BNB has been meagre and relatively fragmented (
