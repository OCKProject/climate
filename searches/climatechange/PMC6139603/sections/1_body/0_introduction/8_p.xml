 <xref rid="br0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Adem et al. (2016)</xref> used A2 and B2 emission scenarios (see subsection 
 <xref rid="se0240" ref-type="sec" class="xref">5.2</xref> on page 17 for details) to analyse climate change effects on the upper Gilgel Abay using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the HadCM3 from the Hadley Centre in the UK. They concluded that both scenarios would lead to an increase in precipitation from September to February and a notable decrease from May to August. According to their results, mean annual streamflow would increase by 10% (A2 scenario) or 6.4% (B2 scenario) by the end of the century. However, according to 
 <xref rid="br0280" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Girvetz et al. (2012)</xref> knowing how temperature and precipitation is projected to change on average in the future is not very useful for decision support. Instead, precipitation and temperature changes must be used to create more adapted applications and information indicating the corresponding impacts on water supply, biodiversity, agriculture, and more. There is a need to deliver this data in a comprehensible format and with understandable conclusions to decision-makers, planners, and engineers.
