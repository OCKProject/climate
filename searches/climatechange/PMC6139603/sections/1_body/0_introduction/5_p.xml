 <xref rid="br0370" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim and Kaluarachchi (2009)</xref> evaluated the impact of six climate change scenarios on water resources in Ethiopia's upper BNB, using weighted values of outcomes. They relied on two streamflow stations (El Deim and Kessie) for the entire BNB as well as nine weather stations (from the National Meteorology Agency) for climate data. Their results did not include goodness of fit for the model used and only reflected changes in flow regimes for different scenarios. Their results indicated increasing rainfall in the dry season coupled with increasing flood risks in downstream countries based on high-flow statistics. In a separate study focused on the implications of climate change for hydrological extremes in the BNB, 
 <xref rid="br0520" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taye et al. (2011)</xref> concluded that the overall trend emerging from many different streamflow projections is towards increasing high and low flows, leading to a reduction in drought events.
