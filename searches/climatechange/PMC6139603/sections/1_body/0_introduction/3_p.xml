It will have a major impact on the region. There is an increasing need for corresponding estimates of current and future streamflows. At the same time, strong scientific evidence indicates that average global temperature (
 <xref rid="br0330" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change), 2008</xref>) will rise 1.4–5.8 °C by 2100, with average sea levels rising 10 cm over the same period. However, climate scenarios are expected to vary considerably in time and space, affecting climatic and meteorological variables very differently depending on the region, with major impacts on local natural environments and human systems. Whatever the case, any change in average global temperature will affect the spatial and temporal occurrence of rainfall. This, in turn, will affect hydrological cycles, water balances, and the resulting availability of water resources. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) findings indicate that a country like Ethiopia will most likely be more vulnerable to climatic change because of its particular climatic, hydrologic, and economic circumstances. Estimating future rainfall changes over sub-Saharan Africa remains challenging; nevertheless, in regions with high or complex topography like Ethiopia, downscaled projections point to increases in rainfall and extreme rainfall (
