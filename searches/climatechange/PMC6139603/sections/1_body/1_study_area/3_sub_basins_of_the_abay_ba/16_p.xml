<p id="pr0650" class="p">Running from the source of the Abay to Lake Tana, this sub-basin is dominated by several hydropower schemes, one of which is the Tana–Beles hydropower plant. However, since the water outtake could not be reliably modelled, the present study omits the Lake Tana basin and instead uses discharge data from Lake Tana (1982–2010) as inflow data to the Kessie sub-basin.</p>
