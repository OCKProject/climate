The Kessie sub-basin was given by the availability of discharge data between Lake Tana and the Kessie Bridge. No data on large tributaries or data on the Blue Nile River were available in between. Consequently, the sub-basin was modelled as seen in 
 <xref rid="fg0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data were used for simulation (1979â€“2013), as were available rainfall data from the Water and Land Resource Centre (WLRC) covering the eastern parts of the basin from 1981 to 2013. The Kessie watershed contributes roughly 35% streamflow to the Abay Basin and is computed using the Lake Tana sub-basin as inlet.
