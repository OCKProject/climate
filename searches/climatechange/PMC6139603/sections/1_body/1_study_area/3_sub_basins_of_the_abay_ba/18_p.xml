<p id="pr0670" class="p">The lower Abay sub-watershed is the largest watershed in the research area. It spans from the Kessie Bridge down to the Sudanese border. The lower Abay sub-watershed was simulated with inlets from the six other sub-basins described above. On average, the lower Abay watershed receives 77% of the streamflow from above and contributes roughly 23% from its surface. Further, an annual average of 1,734.5 cubic meters per second (cms or m
