 <xref rid="fg0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The upper BNB covers 17% of Ethiopia's surface area, generates 43% of the country's total average runoff, and is home to about 25% of its total population (

The Blue Nile River discharge regime is highly seasonal with over 80% of its annual discharge occurring from July to October, and only 4% from January to April (
