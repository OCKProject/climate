<p id="pr0280" class="p">The CFSR data from 1979 to 2013 were adopted as the baseline climate scenario for the Abay Basin, indicating typical precipitation and temperature patterns. Three General Circulation Models (GCM) were used to model future climate change. The CGCM 3.1 (Canadian Global Coupled Model 3.1) from the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCMA), the CNRM-CM 3 (
