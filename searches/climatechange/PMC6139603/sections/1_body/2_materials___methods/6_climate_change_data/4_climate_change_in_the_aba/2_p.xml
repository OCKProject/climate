<p id="pr0300" class="p">Under the IPCC A1B scenario the three models (CCCMA, CNRM, MRI) show similar trends for temperature change for both of the two chosen periods (2046–2064 and 2081–2099). The absolute temperature change varies from +2.0 °C (10.3%) to +2.7 °C for the mid-century period and from +2.7 °C to +3.7 °C (18.8%) for the end of century period for the Abay Basin (see 
 <xref rid="tbl0090" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 9</xref> on page 21 for details). All GCMs show that the mid-century significantly deviates from the baseline but the end of century projection will generally increase but to a lesser extent than the mid-century temperature from the baseline (see
