<p id="pr0310" class="p">All GCMs project a general temperature increase with a more or less significant loss of seasonality. The CCCMA and MRI models show a small variation of mean monthly temperature throughout the year (±4 °C) and do not show the temperature drop from June to September, which is consistent with the projected rainfall pattern. The CNRM model projects a strong increase of temperature from January to April and a significant drop in mean temperature after May.</p>
