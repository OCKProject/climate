<p id="pr0330" class="p">The end of century period shows a further increase in mean annual precipitation for the CNRM and the MRI models going from +381 mm (+27%) to +671 mm (+48%). The CCCMA model projects a decrease from mean annual mid-century rainfall to +7% from baseline. All GCMs show a similar trend regarding the annual distribution of rainfall (see 
 <xref rid="fg0040" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> for details). For the mid-century period peak mean monthly precipitation is reduced but the duration of the rainfall period is extended to before and after the baseline rainfall period (January to May and September to December, respectively).
