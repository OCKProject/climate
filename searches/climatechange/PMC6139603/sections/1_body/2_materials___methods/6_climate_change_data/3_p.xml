<p id="pr0290" class="p">Three different GCMs were used because it is typically difficult to select a specific GCM for a given study area. The precipitation and temperature files for the simulation periods were acquired in SWAT file format from the Climate Change Data for SWAT website (CMIP3,

This website makes downscaled and bias-corrected data available that span the entire globe and have been generated through a collective effort between The World Bank, The Nature Conservancy, Climate Central, and Santa Clara University, USA (

Each scenario represents a specific quantification of one of four possible “storylines”. For the present research, the A1B scenario was used: it posits a future world featuring rapid economic growth, a global population that peaks by mid-century (2050) and declines thereafter, and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. Under the A1B scenario, the technological emphasis is balanced across all energy sources (IPCC, 2000), i.e. no one particular energy source is relied upon. Storylines A2 (self-reliance and preservation), B1 (service and information economy), and B2 (environmental protection and social equity) were rejected for credibility reasons.
