 <italic class="italic">accessed October 2015</italic>) for the entire Abay basin (bounding box: latitude 8.60°–12.27° N and longitude 33.94°–40.40° E). Rainfall and climate data were obtained from the NMA in Addis Abeba. The NMA dataset comprised 35 meteorological stations and time series from 1970 to 2004, but contained significant gaps. In order to identify the most accurate rainfall and climate stations out of the 399 CFSR stations, they were correlated to NMA and WRLC climatic stations in the respective sub-basins. Time series were compared for mean monthly rainfall and for seasonal lows and peaks. Goodness of fit was determined through the Root Mean Square Error-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR), the Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and the percent Bias (PBIAS) while also monitoring ME, R2, skewness, standard deviation as well as the number of recorded years and mean yearly rainfall. Of the initial 399 CFSR stations covering the entire BNB, a total of 42 were retained for SWAT simulations because their data significantly correlated with measured NMA and WLRC data (see
