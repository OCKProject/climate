<p id="pr0240" class="p">Similarly, soil maps were combined from different sources and reclassified for better integration into the SWAT model. For this purpose, soil maps from 
 <xref rid="br0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brunner (2012)</xref> with a soil topography relationship were reclassified with the superordinate soil categories containing more specific soil categories from the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD). Reclassification was performed based on spatial and geomorphological conditions of the different soil types. This made it possible to link the HWSD soil classes with the soil parameters of the SWAT database (see
