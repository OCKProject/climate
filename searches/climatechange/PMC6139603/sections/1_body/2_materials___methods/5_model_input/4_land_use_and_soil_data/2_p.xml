<p id="pr0230" class="p">The initial land use and land cover data sets obtained were produced at a spatial resolution insufficient for the requirements of this study and were not related to topography. The Global Land Cover Characterization (GLCC) database of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) is produced at a resolution of 1 km (
 <xref rid="br0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ali, 2014</xref>), while the map from the Eastern Nile Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) only has five dominant land use categories (
 <xref rid="br0260" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Easton et al., 2010</xref>) and the BCEOM only has seven land cover categories (
 <xref rid="br0240" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dessie et al., 2014</xref>). High-resolution land use maps were only available for small watersheds within the target area, such as, for example, the high-resolution land use maps of the WLRC (

 <xref rid="br0340" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kassawmar et al. (2016)</xref> developed a land cover dataset for the Ethiopian Highlands featuring a resolution of 30 m (for details, see the Economics of Land Degradation [ELD] Ethiopia Case Study from 
 <xref rid="br0320" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hurni et al., 2015</xref>). For the present study using SWAT, additional land use classes were needed to represent the system. Thus, new land use classes were added to the ELD classes by incorporating two additional datasets: (1) the FAO's farming and cropping system and livelihood zone map (
 <xref rid="br0410" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Medhin, 2011</xref>); and (2) the agro-ecological zone maps of
