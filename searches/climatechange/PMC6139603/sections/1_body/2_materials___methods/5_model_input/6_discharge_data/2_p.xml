<p id="pr0270" class="p">There are relatively few reliable hydrologic stations in the Abay Basin, despite its size. This is mainly due to general inaccessibility, remoteness, and economic constraints on setting up and maintaining adequate monitoring networks (
 <xref rid="br0360" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kim and Kaluarachchi, 2008</xref>). Thus, for the present study, river discharge data were obtained from different sources. Daily discharge data were obtained from the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) of the Hydrology Department of the Ministry of Water Resources of Ethiopia, and from the WLRC in Ethiopia. The sub-basins in the SWAT were designed to fit the available hydrological stations (see 
 <xref rid="fg0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> for details). Still, the available discharge data were characterized by significant gaps, occasional extremes for no apparent reason, and missing data. Thus, whenever possible, the apparently unreliable stations were removed and sub-basins were modelled using the most reliable data sources possible.
