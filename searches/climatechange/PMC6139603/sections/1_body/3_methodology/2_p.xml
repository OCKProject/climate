 </inline-formula>. Sub-basin partitioning and stream networks were first computed automatically with ArcSWAT, and then adapted to the outlet feature classes to reflect the available river gauges (see 
 <xref rid="fg0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Each of the six upstream watersheds (Beles, Kessie, Temcha, Muger, Didesa, and Dabus) was calibrated individually using the baseline climate data and the available streamflow data. Each watershed was then run for the entire period from 1979 to 2014 using the calibrated parameter settings. This final run from each sub-basin was then used as an inflow data to the lower Abay watershed during its calibration run. Each watershed was calibrated using 500 simulations for each iteration. Initial parameter range values were set at the same absolute magnitude for each sub-basin (see
