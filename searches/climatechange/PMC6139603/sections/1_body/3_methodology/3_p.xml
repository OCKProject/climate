<p id="pr0360" class="p">After calibration and validation, each of the seven upstream watersheds was run once with the best simulation parameters using the climate change rainfall and temperature data from CMIP3. Thus, each watershed was run for three different GCMs and each GCM was run for scenarios A1B. Each scenario for each GCM was compared and analysed regarding outcomes according to scenarios A1B (see subsection
