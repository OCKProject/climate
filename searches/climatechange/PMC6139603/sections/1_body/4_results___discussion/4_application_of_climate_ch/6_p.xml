<p id="pr0720" class="p">Application of the climate change scenarios for the period at century's end revealed a more pronounced change in outflows from the upper Abay basin. The CCCMA model projects an increase in mean annual precipitation of +7%, resulting in an increased annual outflow of +0.7%, coupled with a strong temporal shift away from the baseline rainy period. The CNRM model projects an increase in mean annual precipitation of +27%, resulting in a mean monthly streamflow increase of +76%. The predicted streamflow is mainly distributed around the baseline peak period, accompanied by a prolonged outflow increase between May and December and generally increased streamflow between January and May (see 
 <xref rid="tbl0050" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref> for details). The MRI model projects an increase of 48% in mean annual precipitation, coupled with a clear temporal shift in rainfall towards the beginning of the year, peaking in April. This leads to a strong increase in streamflow (+97%) between January and May, followed by a slow decrease through November before starting again in December (see
