<p id="pr0750" class="p">In the present study, Abay basin baseline outflows from the calibrated SWAT model were compared with projected outflows after applying the three GCMs for the two reference periods. The calibrated SWAT model for the Abay basin indicates an annual outflow of 54.7 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which is approximately 68% of the total Nile flow of 80 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The CCCMA model projects an increase in Abay basin outflow to as high as 69.5 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the mid-century period, followed by a decline back down to 55.1 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the period at century's end. The CNRM model projects an increase to as high as 71.6 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the mid-century period, followed by an additional increase to as high as 96 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the period at century's end. The MRI model projects an increase to 66.3 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> around mid-century, followed by another increase to arrive at outflows as high as 108 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (roughly double the baseline) for the period at century's end.
