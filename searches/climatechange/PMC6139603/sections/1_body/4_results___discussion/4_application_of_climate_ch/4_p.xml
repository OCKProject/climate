<p id="pr0700" class="p">Application of the three GCM models to the SWAT points to a shift away from the current main outflow season towards an earlier peak (temporally) and a longer, more gradual extension of annual outflow (see 
 <xref rid="fg0050" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 5</xref> for details). Generally, an increase of between 21% and 30% is projected over the current outflow, which presently stands at 1,734 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. The CCCMA and the MRI model both project a strong increase in flows from January to June with an equally strong decrease for the period June to November. The CNRM model projects a shift in the main rainy season moving it towards the end of the year with a peak in September and a higher distributed outflow throughout the year. All projected outflows follow their respective projected rainfall pattern regarding seasonality. This means that streamflow shifts in the same direction as projected rainfall shifts. Regarding rainfall amounts and rainfall amount changes, the relationship to streamflow is less apparent. The CCCMA model estimates that mean average yearly rainfall will increase approximately 36%, resulting in a streamflow increase of 27% at the outflow of the Abay river. The CNRM model projects an increase of 17.4% in mean annual precipitation, resulting in a streamflow increase of 30%. Finally, the MRI model projects an increase of 46% in mean annual precipitation, resulting in an increase of mean streamflow of 21.2%.
