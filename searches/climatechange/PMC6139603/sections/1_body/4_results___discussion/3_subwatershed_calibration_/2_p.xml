<p id="pr0400" class="p">Six sub-basins of the upper Abay were calibrated individually and their calibrated outflows were used as inflows for the lower Abay basin (see 
 <xref rid="fg0060" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> for details). The calibration of the six sub-watersheds performed satisfactorily to very good. Larger sub-watersheds performed better than smaller ones. The lower performance of the Muger sub-watershed could be due to the above-mentioned loss of water via the aquifer connection between the Muger and the Awash basin, which could not be accounted for. The Muger sub-watershed had long periods of low flows that could not be calibrated using this parameter setup, and the model could not be further adapted due to lack of reliable information. Nonetheless, the model performed well overall (see Tables 
 <xref rid="tbl0040" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl0080" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref> respectively), as indicated by the good results of R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, NSE, bR
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, and RSR (see section 
 <xref rid="se0210" ref-type="sec" class="xref">4.1</xref> for details on model performance as well as 
 <xref rid="tbl0080" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref> for calibration and validation results).
