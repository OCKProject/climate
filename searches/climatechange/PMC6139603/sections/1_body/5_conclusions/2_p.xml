<p id="pr0470" class="p">Despite improvements in climatic modelling, the findings of this study highlight remaining uncertainty between different GCMs regarding projected changes. The results indicate similar trends, but divergent patterns of precipitation and temperature change. Regarding future temperature changes in the Abay basin, all three GCMS predict increases in mean temperature, including similar temperature peaks and similar drops in mean monthly temperature. Further, all three GCMs project that the main rainy season will gradually decline in intensity, with precipitation becoming more distributed throughout the year. The projected temperature and precipitation changes, in turn, have noticeable impacts on modelled streamflows. Generally, the streamflows are projected to increase, either mildly (+0.71%) or dramatically (+97%). Consequently, baseline streamflows are projected to be higher throughout the year. All in all, this could result in increased water availability for rainfed agriculture, domestic consumption, and hydroelectric production. Sudan and Egypt could also benefit from more constant and increased water flow. Nevertheless, uncertainty remains over how climate change will affect the Blue Nile outflows. This, again, is evidenced by the climate change data applied for analyses in the present study. While the three applied models matched in terms of general trends, they diverged with respect to the outcomes for the basin's monthly precipitation and streamflow. At the same time, despite the large differences in projected (absolute) streamflow values, all the models predict more or less dramatic changes in annual patterns of rainfall and temperature. The results suggest that the policy focus should remain on knowledge generation and adaptation to possible outcomes and on mitigation of climate change impacts.</p>
