  <p class="p">Trends in mean annual grassland NPP values between 1988 and 2012 within the TRHR. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Average values and standard deviations (SD) of different grassland use type impacts on NPP changes. Conversions denoted G-G, O-G, and G-O refer to the non-conversion of grassland (G-G), conversion from other land uses (O-G), and conversion to other land uses (G-O), respectively. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Linear trends in annual NPP of different retained unconverted grassland types. The dashed line on this graph is the linear regression fit to annual NPP. Grassland types denoted MDW, ASAG, ASAM and DG refer to the meadow (MDW), alpine and sub-alpine grassland (ASAG), alpine and sub-alpine meadow (ASAM) and desert grassland (DG), respectively.
