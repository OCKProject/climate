<p id="Par8" class="p">Data show that grassland NPP values within the TRHR are related to different grassland types. Thus, per unit area NPP values for alpine and sub-alpine meadows (ASAM) and meadows (MDW) were both higher than those for alpine and sub-alpine grasslands (ASAG) and desert grasslands (DG), at average values of 283.97 gC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and 176.36 gC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, respectively. The latter grassland category (DG) is characterized by the lowest per unit area average NPP values (18.68 gC m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), while the total values for meadows were lowest overall, just 0.19 tC yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The average total NPP values for alpine and sub-alpine grasslands as well as desert grasslands were higher, at values of 0.34 tC yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.19 tC yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively.
