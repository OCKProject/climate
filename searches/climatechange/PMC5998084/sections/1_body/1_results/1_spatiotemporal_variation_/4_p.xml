<p id="Par10" class="p">Data show that the distribution of NPP varies depending on grassland type and climatic gradient (i.e. precipitation and temperature). Grassland NPP values across the TRHR varied between 6.07 gC·m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 1,086.87 gC·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>·yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> over the course of this study; indeed, NPP values in the east and south of this region exhibited relatively large inter-annual variations between 1988 and 2012 and have which tended to increase over the last 25 years. Significant increases in grassland NPP have been recorded in most areas of the TRHR, encompassing 63.22% of the total area covered by this ecosystem type (Fig.
