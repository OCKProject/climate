<p id="Par9" class="p">A clear temporal pattern in retained unconverted grassland NPP values is evident in terms of interannual variations. Data show that between 1988 and 2012, recorded per unit area NPP values for different grassland types all showed significant interannual increases as well as large differences in their degrees of fluctuation, especially over the last decade between 2000 and 2012) (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Categories of ASAM and DG exhibited smaller fluctuations over this period while since the area covered by MDW remained relatively small (just 0.42% of total retained unconverted grassland), variation of this grassland type was both the largest and most unstable.
