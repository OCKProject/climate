<p id="Par19" class="p">Grasslands are just one important variable that connect socioeconomics to natural ecosystems. Indeed, at the county scale, socioeconomic variables directly impact the area of grassland and thus indirectly influence linear trends in NPP. Data show that GDP-grassland (−0.021, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and HPD-grassland (−0.009, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.1) interactions both exerted significantly negative effects on the NPP of this ecosystem type, indicating that linear trends in this variable across a watershed characterized by a higher proportion of this land use type tend to be more susceptible to negative economic development and human population growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). At the same time, the effect of meat production on grassland NPP was positive but non-significant (0.006, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.44) over the time period of this study while the area proportion of grassland also directly influences linear trends in productivity. Regression results also show that although grassland area proportion is positively correlated with average NPP, the temporal interaction of the former is negative (−0.003, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001); this means that the rate of increase of grassland NPP will be lower in small watersheds with a high proportion of grassland than in those characterized by smaller areas of this land use type.
