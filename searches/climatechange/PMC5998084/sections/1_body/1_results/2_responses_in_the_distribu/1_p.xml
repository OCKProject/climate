<p id="Par11" class="p">We utilized a three-level growth model to investigate the scale of grassland NPP decomposition across the TRHR, evaluating 1,817 small watersheds within 18 counties (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Variance estimation results based on a random unconditional model (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) show that intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) at the level of small watersheds (ICC
 <sub class="sub">Watershed_ID</sub>) and counties (ICC
 <sub class="sub">County_ID</sub>) in Model 1 are 0.549 and 0.411, respectively. These results show that statistically significant variation in grassland NPP has occurred over time in the intercepts and rates of change grassland NPP values at both levels.
