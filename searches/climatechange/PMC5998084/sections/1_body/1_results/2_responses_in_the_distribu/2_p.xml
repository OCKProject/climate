<p id="Par12" class="p">Compared with their unconditional counterparts, our step-by-step conditional models include a range of different explanatory variables (i.e. climate, grassland, soil, and socioeconomic variables) to capture a proportion of variance (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Results show that between-group variance at both small watershed and county levels (τ
 <sub class="sub">00</sub>) markedly declined between Model 1 and Model 6 while within-group variation also decreased from 0.160 in Model 1 to 0.088 in Model 6. These results suggest that most grassland NPP variation is captured by these explanatory variables.
