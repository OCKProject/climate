<p id="Par14" class="p">We included grassland types and NNRs as dummy variables in our models to distinguish the NPP change trajectories of different ecosystems (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Models 3 to 6). This analysis revealed that differences among nonlinear NPP change trajectories for different grassland types are evident over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4A</xref>); values for DG have steadily increased over the last 25 years at an average annual rate of 4.52%, while values for ASAG, ASAM, and MDW all initially decreased significantly before subsequently rising again. The initial average rates of decrease in these three cases were 1.2%, 0.9%, and 14.5%, before steeper increases were then seen after 2000. In contrast, our results for NNRs reveal that these areas exerted non-significant impact on grassland NPP trajectories over time (p &gt; 0.14) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4B</xref>); average grassland NPP values on NNRs were 11.18 gC/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> higher than in other regions at the start of this analysis before decreasing within these protected regions at higher rates than outside up until 2000. Data clearly reveal a turning point in grassland NPP trajectories within the TRHR from 2000 onwards.
