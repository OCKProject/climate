<p id="Par18" class="p">We also carried out an additional effect-based analysis of trends in grassland NPP variation, including a series of interaction terms within the three-level nonlinear growth model, time × climate, year × grassland_pct, and socioeconomic development × grassland_pct. These terms were constructed to assess differences in the magnitude of predictors effect as a function of time. Data show that these interactions were significant in terms of climate variables at the watershed scale, with the exception of the relationship between sunlight and time (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The precipitation-time interaction was also negative for NPP at this scale, indicating that a linear reduction in this latter variable for grasslands was intensified by increased precipitation and that this relationship increases at a faster rate in concert with rainfall levels (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>). In contrast, data reveal a positive temperature-time interaction for grassland NPP; this indicates that linear reduction of this latter variable has been weakened by the positive effects of warming and that this relationship changes more rapidly as temperature levels increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6B</xref>).
