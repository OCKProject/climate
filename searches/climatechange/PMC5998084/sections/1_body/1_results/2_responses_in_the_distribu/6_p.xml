<p id="Par16" class="p">The results of this analysis show that the characteristics of small watersheds, including grassland area percentage, topography (i.e. DEM and slope), soil nutrient content (i.e. N, P, and K), and location, all determine the intercept components of grassland NPP. Calculations reveal a coefficient of 0.033 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.035) for grassland area percentage; this indicates that when the grassland area percentage of a small watershed increases by about 24%, average NPP will also rise by about 3.3%. In contrast, topographic variables (i.e. DEM and slope) have had a mainly negative influence on grassland NPP, causing a gradual decline with increases in altitude and slope. Soil nutrients, however, are positively associated with grassland NPP; a higher soil nutrient level is clearly beneficial to grassland growth. Similarly, the density distribution of highways and villages is also positively related to higher grassland NPP, while the opposite is the case in terms of distance to water sources.
