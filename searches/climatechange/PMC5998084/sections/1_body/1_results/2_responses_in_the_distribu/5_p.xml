<p id="Par15" class="p">The fixed effect coefficients used in our three-level growth model reveal proportional variations in grassland NPP in response to one SD change in an explanatory factor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Model 6). These results therefore show that trajectories of grassland NPP change have been significantly dependent on climate (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>, Model 6). Indeed, quadratic coefficients for both precipitation and temperature are negative in this model which indicates that change in grassland NPP has been hump-shaped in response to these factors, while the coefficients for both these variables were positive versus productivity; values for these variables initially rose in a linear fashion and peaked at high values. In contrast, estimates for grassland NPP change in response to the number of sunlight hours (shour) exhibited both linear and quadratic positive coefficients; these results imply that increases in the number of sunlight hours have likely been beneficial to grassland NPP growth within the TRHR.
