<p id="Par13" class="p">We utilized the fixed part of a three-level growth model to further evaluate decomposition distribution patterns and the influences of grassland NPP. We therefore assessed grassland NPP six times between 1988 and 2012 for each of the 1,817 small watersheds considered in this study at an average interval of 4.8 years. The fit of these unconditional growth models illustrates a slight estimated positive coefficient of quadratic NPP rates of change that differ significantly from zero, while average rates of change were negative and not significant; these data indicate that grassland NPP within the TRHR initially decreased and then increased over the time period of this analysis.</p>
