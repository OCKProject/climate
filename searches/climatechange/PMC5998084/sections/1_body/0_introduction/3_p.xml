<p id="Par4" class="p">The Three-River Headwaters region (TRHR) of China is located in the northeastern area of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and is the birthplace of the Yangtze, Yellow, and Lancang rivers. This region is also known as ‘Asia’s water tank’
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> as it comprises the hinterland and main body of the QTP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Grasslands are the major components of ecological environments in the TRHR and provide numerous goods and services that are valuable to humans including soil conservation, C sequestration, and water retention. At the same time, the harsh environments that characterize this region mean that single and continuous alpine meadows are the dominant surface covering layer

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>; this has resulted in a fragile ecological environment which is highly sensitive to changing climatic conditions

 </sup>. A large body of recent work has demonstrated that the climate of this region has conformed to a ‘warm and moist’ trend over at least the last 50 years

 </sup>. However, as the agricultural economy of the TRHR has rapidly developed since the 1980s, human impacts such as overgrazing, grassland abandonment, and construction have all interfered with ecological processes and caused grassland degradation, habitat loss, and landscape fragmentation
