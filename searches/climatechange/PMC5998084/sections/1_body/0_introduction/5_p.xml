<p id="Par6" class="p">As animal husbandry in the TRHR is important for livelihoods, the growth of grasslands not only impacts the ecological situation and the development of these practices regionally, but also influences ecological security and the economic development of downstream regions as well as across the whole of China. It is therefore critical to determine how grassland production in the TRHR is likely to change given the joint influence of climate and human activities (i.e. population levels, the economy, and animal husbandry) as well as the probable extent of this variation. Current related research in this area has mainly focused on grassland productivity response mechanisms to climate change, while human activities have seldom been addressed. Indeed, in terms of research scale, previous work has also tended to ignore the nested relationships between ecological phenomena and interactions between different scales. The objectives of this study are therefore to: (1) Investigate changes in grassland land use patterns within the TRHR between 1988 and 2012; (2) Reveal trends in NPP changes within this region, and; (3) Establish a multi-level linear model (MLM) to explore the responses of grassland NPP to both climate change and human activities at the level of counties and small watersheds.</p>
