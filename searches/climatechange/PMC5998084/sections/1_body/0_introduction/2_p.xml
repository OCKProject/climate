 </sup>, and usually integrate ecological processes against the same background. However, because both natural and anthropogenic disturbances are spatially heterogeneous, a number of previous studies have demonstrated that ecological phenomena tend to manifest in the form of multi-level and multi-hierarchy structures

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>; this means that both the intensity and mode of a disturbance that results from either natural or anthropogenic factors will exhibit different characteristics depending on scale

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup> and that there will be interactions between these different hierarchical levels
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup>. At the microscopic scale, for example, grassland plant populations with similar biological characteristics tend to survive in similar habitats, while differences in environmental conditions can lead to spatiotemporal species variations. In contrast, the development of grasslands at the macroscopic scale depends not only on climate and geographical characteristics
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>, but also on interventions by conservation and management policies (e.g. prohibition of enclosed grazing and the construction of ecological reserves). These interventions can themselves markedly alter the population characteristics of grasslands, including their homogeneity, richness, and diversity

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>–
