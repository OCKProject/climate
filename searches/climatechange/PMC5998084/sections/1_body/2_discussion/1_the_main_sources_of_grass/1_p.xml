<p id="Par20" class="p">The results of this analysis reveal that the most distinct feature of our MLM compared with other longitudinal approaches is the consideration of data in terms of the hierarchical structuring of repeated measures nested within higher level groups

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. This feature means that MLMs can be used to assess variance related to rates of change in individual cases and to test whether, or not, these rates differ depending on the characteristics of higher-level groups

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup>, and an increasing body of evidence suggests that spatiotemporal variation in NPP within these systems is likely related to direct causes at both meso- and micro-levels (e.g. variability in temperature and precipitation as well as individual vulnerability) as well as indirect effects (e.g. socioeconomic changes at the macro-level)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>
 </sup>. The contributions of these factors are likely different, however, at variable scales. The results of this analysis also lend support to this view by combining evidence from both the macro-county level and the small watershed scale (meso-level). Our MLM analysis of grassland NPP changes within the TRHR shows that about 41.1% of variance can be explained at the county level, while the remaining 54.9% occurs at the level of small watersheds. In other words, grassland NPP variation mainly depends on small watershed features; in contrast, the impacts of socioeconomic development and human population growth on grassland NPP variations remain relatively minor.
