 </sup>. Grassland restoration projects within the TRHR over the last ten to 12 years have been regarded as key responses by the Chinese government, especially since the development of NNRs and the EPRP in 2003 and 2005, respectively. Although the results of this study suggest that the long-term impact of NNRs on grassland NPP has not been significant, the productivity of these ecosystems within the TRHR has nevertheless increased at a faster rate since the initiation of restoration projects and the previous rapid decline has been curbed. This study therefore supports the view that NNRs have had a net positive ecological effect on grasslands.
