Our selection of watershed characteristics mainly encompassed the three aspects of topography, soil properties, and location characteristics; thus, elevation and slope were selected as topographic indices, while the percentage contents of N, K, and P were selected as indicative of soil fertility. The soil attribute information used in this study was extracted from the Harmonized World Soil Database V1.2

Categorical variables included grassland types and the presence of NNRs within small watersheds; these data were obtained from the
