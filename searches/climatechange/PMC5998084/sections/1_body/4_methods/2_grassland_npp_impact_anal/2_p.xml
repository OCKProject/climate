<p id="Par28" class="p">Resultant Chi-squared test results of the variation components in this empty model show that grassland NPP variation between groups is statistically different to zero; 37.21% of this variation can be decomposed to the county level while 40.17% occurs at the watershed level. Observed grassland NPP therefore encompasses both individual group effects at the level of small watersheds and counties although variation analysis results for grassland NPP based on integrating all data samples may deviate. Thus, to more accurately describe the influence of regional climate change on grassland NPP over time, we introduced a development model encompassing three levels (i.e. time, small watershed, and county) to analyse variation tendencies and the mechanisms that influence grassland NPP. This model was constructed by initially incorporating unconditional three-level growth.</p>
