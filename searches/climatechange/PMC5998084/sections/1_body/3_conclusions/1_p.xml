<p id="Par25" class="p">The data presented in this paper show that grassland NPP within the TRHR tended to fluctuate but increase between 1988 and 2012, at an average annual growth rate of up to 1.97%. Changes in grassland NPP reveal that about 41.1% of variance can be explained at the county level, while the remaining 54.9% occurs at the level of small watersheds. Results show that spatiotemporal changes in grassland NPP have mainly been influenced by the distribution of heat and moisture, while precipitation and temperature have been key factors in determining differences in the spatial distribution of grassland quality. Although ‘warm and moist’ trends in climate have been beneficial to increases in grassland NPP, this rate has been faster in relatively drier and warmer regions. In light of these trends, economic development has had a significantly negative effect on grassland NPP growth and this variable has increased at a faster rate in such regions. Economic development and increases in population levels have also had negative impacts on grassland NPP; data suggest that an increase of 149 million CNY and 30.6 thousand people·km
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> would likely result in grassland NPP growth decreases of 0.093% and 0.299%, respectively.
