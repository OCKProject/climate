<p class="p">Such an analysis would need to take into account the way in which moral landscapes are organised around political allegiance. As hypothesised, we found that comments on right wing newspapers contained significantly more moral disengagement than those on left wing newspapers, whereas the opposite was true for moral engagement. Moreover, there was significantly more moral engagement than disengagement in the Guardian and significantly more disengagement than engagement in the Mail and Telegraph.

Rates of engagement and disengagement were similar for the two right wing papers, suggesting that those who comment on them share a moral perspective that cuts across the different social status of the tabloid—broadsheet divide (Chan &amp; Goldthorpe,
