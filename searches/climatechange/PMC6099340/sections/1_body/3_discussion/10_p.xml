<p class="p">One way of proceeding would be to view Bandura's theory as one of several possible moral landscapes on ACC, each with its own areas of concern and sensitivity. We suggest that each person constructs their own moral landscape discursively in collaboration with valued others, leading different groups of people to interpret and react to the same events (such as the release of an IPCC report) in radically different ways. This possibility could be explored by examining how members of distinct groups within society construct and moralise ACC. Such research would require a bottom‐up emphasis, focusing on what people do and say in practice, and not be constrained by current theorising. For instance, not only is the “dishonesty” theme identified in the current research not captured by Bandura's theory, it also does not obviously or neatly fit into any single moral foundation outlined by Haidt and Joseph (
