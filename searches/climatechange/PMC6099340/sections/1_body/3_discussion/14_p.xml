<p class="p">This study demonstrates that readers' online comments represent a rich source of data on public discourse, enabling us to move beyond analyses of the media, toward how media claims are interpreted and mobilised by the general public. Although we do not yet know how representative online comments are of the views of the entire readership of particular newspapers, the large numbers of recommendations that some comments received, particularly in the Daily Mail, suggest that the views expressed do resonate to some degree with the readership, beyond those who post comments.</p>
