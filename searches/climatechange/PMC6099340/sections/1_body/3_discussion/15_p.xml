<p class="p">The relationship between media claims and the beliefs and assertions of readers is not a simple one, and our understanding of it remains in its infancy. For instance, Gaskell, Bauer, Durant, and Allum (
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) found that in the case of food biotechnology, it was the coverage of scientific controversies rather than positive or negative coverage per se that predicted more negative public perceptions of genetically modified food. Gaskell et al. (
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>) conclude that “Different histories of media coverage and regulations go together with different public perceptions, and these in turn reflect deeper cultural sensitivities” (p. 385). Therefore, rather than providing evidence of the direct effects of media coverage on people's perceptions of social realities, analysing readers' comments gives a unique opportunity to witness their sense‐making activities. This sense‐making process may constitute collective symbolic coping (Wagner &amp; Kronberger, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), that is, “the collective activity of a group struggling to maintain the integrity of its worldview which is also crucial for social identity” (p. 4)—an identity that is to some extent constituted through people's relationships with particular newspapers as broadsheets or tabloids; left or right wing. Thus, although acknowledging that these sense‐making practices might be specific to the characteristics of online commenters (see Martin, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>, for an interesting critical approach to understanding barriers and facilitators to commenting online), they might offer insight into the processes underlying this important activity and help developing testable theoretical frameworks for future research.
