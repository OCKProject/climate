<p class="p">What the “ACC proponents as dishonest” discourse and “ACC is less important than X” claims have in common is that they both appear purely as moral disengagement in Bandura's theory but can be seen as moral engagement when placed in the context of other, potentially competing, moral concerns. There is a need, then, for a theory that can capture a wider range of moralising around ACC than that encapsulated in Bandura's theory, in order to gain a fuller understanding of the moral reasoning circulating among lay climate sceptics.</p>
