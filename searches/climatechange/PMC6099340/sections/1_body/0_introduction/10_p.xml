<p class="p">We suggest that this overall ideological difference in sympathy toward the issue of ACC in the media may extend to readers. As yet we know relatively little about whether and how media discourse on ACC is taken up, used and transformed by the public, and online comments represent a useful resource in this respect (Woods et al.

 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The third aim of the current study was to build on the extant literature on differences between left and right wing media in their treatment of ACC, to assess whether their readers also differ. We hypothesised that moral disengagement themes would be more prevalent in comments on conservative rather than left leaning newspapers, whereas the opposite would be true of moral engagement themes. Further, we hypothesised that moral engagement would be more common than disengagement in comments on left leaning newspapers, and that the opposite would be true in comments on the right wing newspapers. Although those who comment on such articles are not necessarily representative of readerships at large, we also make use of “recommendations” data (i.e., the frequency with which comments were endorsed by other readers) to give an approximate sense of how widespread particular views are within each readership.
