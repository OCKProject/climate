<p class="p">Analyses of online comments on newspaper articles must take into consideration the political leanings of the media concerned. British newspapers are ideologically polarised, between left and right wing political persuasion. Although ACC is not as ideologically divided in the UK as in the USA (Pidgeon, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), ACC scepticism is far more prevalent in the British right wing media than the left (Carvalho, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Carvalho &amp; Burgess, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Doulton &amp; Brown,

 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-8883" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Left wing newspapers may also tend to express more concern for potential victims of ACC beyond the UK compared with their right wing counterparts (Laksa, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This differential attention to victims may be considered an example of moral engagement at the fourth locus of Bandura's theory (emphasising victims), whereas scepticism about the existence of ACC may represent moral disengagement at the third locus (outcomes).
