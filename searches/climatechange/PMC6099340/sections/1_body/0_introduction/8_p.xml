<p class="p">One possible limitation of using Bandura's theory to understand ACC moralising is its focus on the moral issue of harm/care. This is indeed the moral concern most frequently raised with respect to ACC (Gardiner, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hansen, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Markowitz, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and in this sense, the theory seems to be well placed to make sense of people's moralising around ACC, especially with an “engagement” extension. However, cross‐cultural research indicates that harm/care is just one of several key moral concerns, or foundations, to which humans are sensitive, others including justice, loyalty, hierarchy, sanctity, and liberty (Haidt, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Iyer, Koleva, Graham, Ditto, &amp; Haidt, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Shweder, Much, Mahapatra, &amp; Park, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Cultures and subcultures vary in the extent to which they recognise distinct moral foundations, with the result that their members become more sensitive and responsive to transgressions in some foundations than others (Graham, Haidt, &amp; Nosek, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Haidt &amp; Joseph, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). It is possible, then, that people may moralise ACC with respect to foundations other than harm/care, and that these attempts to moralise might not be captured by Bandura's scheme. For instance, Feinberg and Willer (
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) showed that environmental concerns can be discursively framed in terms of sanctity rather than harm/care, and that when they are, they appeal more to people who are more oriented to this moral foundation. Therefore, our second aim was to assess the adequacy of Bandura's harm/care‐focused framework to make sense of the full diversity of people's moral responses to ACC.
