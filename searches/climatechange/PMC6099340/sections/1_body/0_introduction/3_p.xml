<p class="p">Climate change has been described as “a perfect moral storm,” involving the convergence of multiple factors that make it difficult for humans to react in an ethical way (Gardiner, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>, p. 398), at least until mitigating action may be too late (Pidgeon, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). A key difficulty is that high carbon behaviours are highly valued and deeply embedded in many people's lives (Gardiner, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Gifford, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sheller, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Steg, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). This can create dissonance between moral values and behaviour for those who are concerned about ACC, yet feel unable or unwilling to change their behaviours accordingly, yielding negative emotions including guilt (Markowitz &amp; Shariff, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). One solution to such dissonance is motivated moral reasoning (Markowitz &amp; Shariff, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Perhaps, the most detailed formulation of such reasoning is Bandura's theory of moral disengagement, which describes a set of psychosocial mechanisms by which people selectively disengage the moral sanctions they would otherwise apply to actions that go against their moral values (Bandura, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara, &amp; Pastorelli, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>).
