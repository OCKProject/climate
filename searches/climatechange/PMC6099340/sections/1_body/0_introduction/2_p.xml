<p class="p">Evidence continues to accrue for the existence of anthropogenic climate change (ACC) and its likely negative consequences for humans and other species around the globe (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [IPCC],

 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Philosophers and others have, consequently, argued that ACC is an important moral issue with respect to the values of justice (those who caused the problem are not those most likely to suffer as a result; Jamieson,

 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such engagement certainly cannot be taken for granted, with behavioural and other changes still desperately needed to curb carbon emissions (Seto et al.,
