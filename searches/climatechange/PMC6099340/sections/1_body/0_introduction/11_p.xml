<p class="p">We analysed online comments on three newspaper articles published in late March 2014. Each reported leaked content just prior to the release of the second part of the fifth IPCC assessment report, which focused on impacts, and thus had clear relevance to the harm/care moral foundation. Therefore, we hoped that these articles would be particularly likely to trigger moralised comments, whether in the form of engagement or disengagement.</p>
