<p class="p">We used an adjusted version of thematic analysis (Braun &amp; Clarke, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Comments were interpreted as discursive contributions to public discourse on ACC (Edwards &amp; Potter, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>), through which individual people construct an orientation to ACC dialogically (Bakhtin, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>) thus incorporating elements of both constructionist and realist epistemologies (Braun &amp; Clarke, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Initially, broad semantic‐level themes were generated by all authors through a mixture of inductive (derived from the data) and deductive (informed by Bandura's framework) approaches. The authors discussed and agreed upon a final broad coding scheme, with separate themes for moral engagement, moral disengagement (both defined in terms of Bandura's scheme), truth claims supporting ACC, and truth claims challenging ACC. Scepticism around the existence of ACC is considered a type of moral disengagement by Bandura (
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Its counterpart, belief in the existence of ACC is not necessarily an act of moral engagement; indeed, Bandura argues that it can be a driver of motivated moral disengagement. However, unsolicited active public assertions of the reality of ACC in response to a newspaper article articulating negative consequences of ACC are discursive actions, which, we would argue, are best construed as moral engagement. Therefore, truth claims supporting ACC were categorised as moral engagement in this study. We assigned separate codes to both supporting and challenging truth claim themes because they were so prevalent in the dataset relative to other kinds of moral (dis)engagement. A small number of other codes were developed for the purposes of a different set of analyses. All themes in any given comment were coded as nonoverlapping sections of the text. If a comment included only material, that did not fit into any themes, it was coded as “other.”
