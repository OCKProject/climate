<p class="p">The three selected articles were very similar in terms of content, outlining the main points of the report and contextualising it within the scope of IPCC activities. All three included appeals from experts and signatories of the report for action to address or contain the foreseeable negative outcomes of CC, which might be seen as moral engagement at Bandura's first locus (behaviour). Moreover, all articles contained statements that coordinated action had the potential to cope with negative consequences, and all reported the potentially devastating consequences of inaction, thus emphasising Bandura's second (agency) and third (outcomes) loci, respectively. Although all three articles stressed the general consensus in the scientific community on ACC, they all quoted dissenting voices (in particular, that of Professor Richard Tol) and reminded readers of past and present controversies. However, only the Daily Mail described governments as “lobbying” for a change in the wording of the report, thus potentially opening the door to speculations around the influence of political interests on the report.</p>
