<p class="p">A search of the Lexis Nexis database was carried out including all UK national newspapers in the period February 12 to May 12, 2014, which covered the release of the second and third parts of the fifth IPCC report (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The search terms used were (climate change OR global warming) AND (IPCC OR Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), all categorised as “major mentions.” Once duplicates were taken into account, the search yielded 82 articles, of which 31 were available online and also had at least 100 comments each. This was narrowed down to 17 articles, which were published within a week before and after the release of the second part of the IPCC report on March 31, 2014. Of these 17 articles, only five were news articles focused on the overall content of the IPCC report; others focused on specific aspects of the IPCC or the report (such as the role of politicians in writing the report, or implications of the report for wildlife) or were opinion pieces. The five appropriate articles appeared in the Telegraph (2), Guardian, Independent, and Daily Mail. We had hoped to select four articles, representing all format (broadsheet vs. tabloid) and ideology (left vs. right wing) combinations. The Guardian article (Goldenberg, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) was selected as the left wing broadsheet, being widely regarded as more liberal than the Independent. The Telegraph article with the most comments (Demetrio, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) was selected as the right wing broadsheet, and the Daily Mail article (Zolfagharifard, 
 <xref rid="casp2355-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) as the right wing tabloid. Unfortunately, there was no equivalent left wing tabloid article available.
