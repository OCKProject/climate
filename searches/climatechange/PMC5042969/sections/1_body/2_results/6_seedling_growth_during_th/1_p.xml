<p class="p">After the first growing season on the three planting sites (2+1), seedling height was significantly affected by site and orchard (

 <sup class="sup">âˆ—</sup>orchard was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.29). Seedlings on the Asselin site were significantly taller (52.2 cm) than those growing on the most south-westerly site, Watford (50.2 cm), and the most north-easterly site, Deville (46.3 cm) (
