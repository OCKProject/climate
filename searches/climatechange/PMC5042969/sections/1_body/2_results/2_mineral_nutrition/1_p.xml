<p class="p">During the first growing season (1+0), the effects of orchard and date were significant for all of the mineral elements (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) contained in the shoot tissues and whole seedlings, whereas the effect of orchard was not significant for K content (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.2). The date
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>orchard interaction was only significant for K content of the shoots (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0005) and whole seedlings (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.004). The seedlings from SO2 had a higher (14.16 ± 1.13 mg) K content than those from SO4 (7.47 ± 1.13 mg), SO5 (8.42 ± 2.39 mg), and SO8 (8.58 ± 2.50 mg). The K content of shoots from SO3 (12.28 ± 2.08 mg) was greater than those from SO4 (7.47 ± 2.08 mg). The effect of orchard was significant for all of the other mineral elements (N, P, Ca, Mg) in the shoot tissues as well as for the K content of the roots. With respect to mineral concentrations of the shoot tissues, the date
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>orchard interaction was significant for N (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.02) and K (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.04). Comparisons of means revealed that SO4 (2.61 ± 0.12%), SO6 (2.61 ± 0.11%) and SO7 (2.60 ± 0.09%) attained higher shoot N concentrations than SO2 (2.32 ± 0.19%). In the case of K, the seedlings from SO2 (1.34 ± 0.15%) had a higher concentration than those from SO4 (0.86 ± 0.09 %) and SO7 (1.00 ± 0.14%), and the concentration in seedlings from SO3 (1.19 ± 0.19%) was higher than those from SO4 (0.86 ± 0.09%).
