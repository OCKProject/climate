<p class="p">Analyses of variance showed significant effects of orchard (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) for all of the growth traits measured during the first growing season except for root dry mass (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.09). The effect of sampling date was also significant for all of the traits measured. The date
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup>orchard interaction was significant for the total dry mass (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.04) and the shoot dry mass (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.01) only. At the end of the first growing season (1+0)(October 26, 2011), the comparisons of means of shoot dry mass and total dry mass showed no significant differences among seedlings from different orchards. The average height attained was 9.9 ± 1.9 cm whereas the average diameter was 2.7 ± 0.5 mm. The average dry masses were 0.93 ± 0.29 g for shoots, 0.38 ± 0.12 g for roots, and 1.31 ± 0.39 g for the entire seedling.
