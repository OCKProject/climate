<p class="p">During the 2+0 growing season, the effects of orchard and date were significant for all of the growth traits (diameter

The comparisons made at the end of the second growing season (October 17, 2012) revealed that seedlings from SO3 attained a height (41.9 ± 6.7 cm) that was higher than those of SO6 (33.6 ± 6.8 cm) and SO8 (35.7 ± 5.1 cm), and that seedlings from SO7 were taller (39.8 ± 5.9 cm) than those of SO6 (33.6 ± 6.8 cm) (
