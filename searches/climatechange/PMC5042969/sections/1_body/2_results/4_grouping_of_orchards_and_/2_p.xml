<p class="p">The comparisons of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> (asymptote of the curve), following the modeling of the height growth curves of each group (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A,B</xref>
 </bold>), indicated that G17, G2, and G3 had similar parameters, yet significantly larger than those of groups G45 and G68. The comparisons of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> (inflection point of the curve) indicated that the G68 group was significantly different from the other four groups of seed orchards. Finally, the comparison of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> (growth rate) indicated that all groups were similar (results not presented). Given that SO1, SO7, SO2, and SO3 had similar height growth curves, it was decided to group these orchards together and model the growth curves of the newly established groups of orchards, i.e., the groups comprised of SO1, SO7, SO2, and SO3 (G1723), SO4 and SO5 (G45) and SO6 and SO8 (G68) (
 <bold class="bold">Figures 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B,C</xref>
 </bold>). Comparisons of parameters resulting from this modeling (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </bold>) show that the G1723 group was significantly taller (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 39.1 cm) than groups G45 (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 36.7 cm) and G68 (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> = 35.2 cm) (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5A</xref>
 </bold>). However, group G68 reached its final height significantly faster (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 15 days) than groups G1723 (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 19 days) and G45 (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 18 days) (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5B</xref>
 </bold>) Even though the comparisons of parameter 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> indicated that the height growth curves for the three orchard groups had the same growth rate (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5C</xref>
 </bold>), the three groups showed distinct growth patterns (
