<p class="p">Plantations represent 7% of the area occupied by forests worldwide and they are recognized as a complement to natural forests for wood supply and as a tool for adaptation and mitigation in the face of climate change (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">FAO, 2010</xref>). However, to assure plantation success, the optimal adaptation of genetically improved stock and that from natural populations must be taken into consideration in reforestation programs (

 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pedlar et al., 2011</xref>). For example, in British Columbia, it is now possible to transfer seed sources upward an additional 200 m in elevation for the majority of commercial species (
