<p class="p">The general goal of this study was to assess the impacts of climate change on the adaptation of white spruce seed sources based on morpho-physiological traits. The first evaluation was made during two consecutive years in a forest nursery located within the natural distribution range of the species. The following year, seedlings were planted on three sites representative of Quebecâ€™s three major bioclimatic domains and of the natural ecological gradient where white spruce is reforested, thus simulating assisted migration; the second evaluation was made after the first growing season on the field. Seedlings from eight different genetic seed sources were used: six first-generation seed orchards representative of local sources and two second-generation seed orchards. This characterization allowed us to determine morpho-physiological differentiation among the seed sources and to establish links between seedling traits under forest nursery conditions and the climatic conditions at the location of the seed orchards where parental trees were selected to provide grafts for orchard establishment. Thus, the objectives of the study were: (i) to examine the variation in morpho-physiological traits among white spruce seed sources over two consecutive growing seasons (1+0 and 2+0) in a forest nursery and (ii) to evaluate the growth and survival of seed sources on forest sites during the seedling establishment phase in response to a simulated assisted migration.</p>
