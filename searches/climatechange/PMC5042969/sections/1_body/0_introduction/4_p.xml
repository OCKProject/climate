<p class="p">First-generation seed orchards established in Qu√©bec in the 1980s were made up of grafted plus-trees selected in local natural stands. Thus, each seed orchard provides genetically improved seeds for a boundary-fixed seed zone. Seed transfer guidelines were later established using growth measurements and geographical coordinates of seed sources collected in provenance-progeny tests established in the 1960-1970s (

Even though the transfer model can guide the selection of best adapted seed sources to future climate conditions with the aim of maximizing adaptation and productivity of plantations and help refine current seed zones, it is important to better understand the parameters responsible for the differential adaptation of white spruce seed sources used in reforestation programs. Hence, morpho-physiological characterization in nurseries and on the planting sites simulating assisted migration scenarios should provide better knowledge about the response of the different sources with respect to biotic and abiotic stresses. This knowledge could be used in conjunction with seed transfer models to refine the selection of genetic material that is both highly productive and tolerant in the face of rapidly changing climates, and potentially help delineate new seed zones. This study is the third in a series in which the ecophysiological related-traits of eight white spruce seed orchards were evaluated. The two previous studies revealed, for seedlings grown under greenhouse conditions (
