 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">SAS Institute Inc., 2011</xref>). A repeated-measures model was used for the variables that were measured bi-weekly (height, diameter, dry mass and tissue mineral nutrition). In this case, sampling dates and orchards were considered to be fixed effects and blocks to be random effects. The most appropriate variance/covariance structure was used for each of the analyzed traits to take into account the autocorrelation between the measurements made on the same experimental units. Several structures were tested and the final selection was made to minimize the likelihood value and the number of parameters. The assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance of the residuals were verified using SAS UNIVARIATE procedure. The level of significance was set at

When the interaction between the effect of orchard and that of sampling date was found to be significant, the comparisons between orchards were made for the last sampling date for each of the two growing seasons (1+0 and 2+0). Multiple comparisons between means were conducted using simulations (
