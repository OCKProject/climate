<p class="p">To determine similarities between orchards with regard to the different morpho-physiological traits, a cluster analysis was performed for the last sampling date of the second growing season (2+0) using the Ward method of the CLUSTER procedure. The grouping was performed using three traits (total height, root dry mass, and shoot nitrogen content) indicative of seedling performance and used to evaluate seedling quality for reforestation in Qu√©bec (
