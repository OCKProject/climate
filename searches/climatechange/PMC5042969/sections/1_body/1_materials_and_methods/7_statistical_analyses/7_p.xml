<p class="p">A multiple regression analysis between final height (2+0) of the seedlings of the six first-generation seed orchards and the climatic conditions at the orchards location was also carried out. Ten climatic variables (growing season temperature, average annual temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, average temperature during the month of July, degree-days ≥5°C, growing season precipitation, total annual precipitation, aridity index and length of growing season) were used. The RSQUARE option of the REG procedure was employed to determine the combination of variables producing the highest coefficient of determination (
