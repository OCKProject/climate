<p class="p">For each sampling date over the two growing seasons, analysis of the mineral nutrition (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) of the shoot and root tissues was performed on composite samples (five seedlings/orchard/block). The total nitrogen concentration was determined by combustion of the sample at high temperature by measuring the thermal conductivity with a LECO Truman N analyser (Leco Corporation, St. Joseph, Michigan). The other elements (P, K, Ca, Mg) were quantified using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (model ICAP 9000, Thermo Instruments, Franklin, Massachusetts). The mineral content (concentration 
 <sup class="sup">∗</sup> dry mass) of each element was calculated, thus reflecting plant nutrient uptake and accumulation (

 <sub class="sub">min</sub>, P, K, Ca, Mg) was also analyzed for composite substrate samples collected from the root plug of seedlings from the same orchard and block. The chemical analyses were conducted by the QMFWP’s Laboratoire de chimie organique et inorganique (certified ISO/CEI 17025).
