<p class="p">Destructive sampling was conducted bi-weekly between August 2 and October 26, 2011 (seven sampling dates) during the first growing season and between May 16 and October 17, 2012 (12 sampling dates) during the second growing season. On each sampling date, five seedlings per orchard were randomly selected from each of the five blocks, for a total of 200 seedlings/sampling date. The five seedlings/orchard/block were harvested from the same container. The choice of the first container selected on each sampling date as well as the choice of the five cavities in this container were determined randomly, whereas the containers for the subsequent orchards and blocks were selected systematically given that their relative position in the block was the same as the first orchardâ€™s initial container. The containers that were sampled during the first season were not part of the random selection process in the second season. The cavities harvested during the sampling process were filled with peat moss and covered in silica to eliminate a bias in the root growth of the seedlings in the neighboring cavities. After each harvest, the seedlings were cleaned with compressed air and washed to remove all traces of substrate from their roots. The five seedlings harvested from the same container were wrapped in wet paper and placed in plastic bags identified by orchard and by block. They were shipped to the QMFWP labs the same day and maintained under refrigerated conditions until they were prepared for drying.</p>
