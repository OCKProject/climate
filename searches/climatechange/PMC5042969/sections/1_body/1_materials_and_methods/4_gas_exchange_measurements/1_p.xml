<p class="p">Gas exchange measurements were conducted on seedlings during their second growing season (2+0). On August 3, 2012, one seedling/orchard/block was randomly sampled at the St-Modeste forest nursery, for a total of 40 seedlings. The seedlings were placed in a growth chamber at Université Laval and measurements were taken between August 6 and 8, 2012 using a LI-COR 6400 (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Light intensity in the growth chamber was approximately 800 μmol/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/s, whereas temperature was 20°C and relative air humidity 55%. Measurements were taken on a section of a lateral branch representing the second year of growth. This branch had to be lignified and the needles had to be fully developed. To avoid water stress, the seedlings were irrigated and saturated by capillarity by placing the seedling containers in a bin of water before the measurements. Three variables were measured: net photosynthesis (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (g
 <sub class="sub">sw</sub>). The measurements were taken at ambient atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> partial pressure (Ca = 380 μmol mol
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and at saturated photosynthetic active radiation (PAR = 800 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). Within the leaf cuvette, air temperature was maintained at 20°C, while vapor pressure deficit and RH were fixed at 1.0 kPa and 55, respectively. Three consecutive stable measurements were averaged to obtain the estimate of each gas exchange variable. Water use efficiency was calculated using the following formula:
