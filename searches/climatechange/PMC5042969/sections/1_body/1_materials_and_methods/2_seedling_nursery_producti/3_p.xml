<p class="p">The tunnel was covered with milk-white polyethylene, 100 μm thick, which transmitted 50 to 55% of incident light (Ginegar Plastic Products Ltd, Multi-layer greenhouse cover film, type UVA/White 45%). The cover could be retracted along both sides to facilitate aeration and modify the air temperature inside the tunnel. During the germination and active growing periods (May to late July), mean air temperature varied between 13 and 29°C. During the period of bud formation and natural hardening (early August to late September), the average daily temperature inside the tunnel decreased progressively, varying from 23 to 6°C. Relative humidity fluctuated between 60 and 87%.</p>
