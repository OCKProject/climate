<p class="p">The seeded containers were placed in a white polyethylene-covered tunnel and were raised approximately 20 cm above the ground surface. To avoid any differential growth among the different seed sources due to the possible presence of an environmental gradient in the tunnel, each seed orchard was represented by 125 containers, which were arranged in five randomized complete blocks. Twenty-five contiguous containers per seed orchard were allocated to each block. The seed orchards were randomly distributed within each block. After germination, seedlings were thinned to one seedling/cavity on mid-July 15, 2011. During the first (1+0) and the second growing season (2+0) (the first number indicates the number of years the seedlings were raised from seeds in the container. The second refers to the number of years the seedling were raised in a plantation), seedlings were irrigated and fertilized using a mechanized boom (Aquaboom, Industrie Harnois, Saint-Thomas-de-Joliette, Qu√©bec) in order to minimize the spatial variability of substrate water content (
