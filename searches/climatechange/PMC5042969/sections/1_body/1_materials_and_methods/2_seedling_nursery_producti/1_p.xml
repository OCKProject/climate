<p class="p">For each of the eight white spruce seed orchards, seed was extracted from cones harvested over two years to ensure a better contribution of the different clones and to account for the inter-annual variation in cone production. To avoid a large difference in seed size and variations in seedling height growth related to seed dimensions (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tousignant et al., 2008</xref>), only seeds with a diameter ≥1.75 mm were sown. This screening of seeds according to their size is used operationally in the province of Québec in an effort to homogenize production and avoid undesirable maternal effects. Three seeds per cavity were manually sown into 25-310 containers (25 cavities per container, 310 cm
