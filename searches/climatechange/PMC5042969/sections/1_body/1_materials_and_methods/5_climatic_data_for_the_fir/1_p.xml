<p class="p">As each of the first-generation seed orchard is composed of trees selected from local natural stands, 30-year average (1981-2010) climatic data estimates were obtained using the centroid of the plus-trees selected to make them up, using the BioSIM software (version 10.2.5.39) (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Régnière and Saint-Amant, 2008</xref>). The estimates were obtained by interpolation of temperature and precipitation data collected in the eight closest weather stations of the orchard and adjusted for differences in latitude, longitude and elevation (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Régnière and Saint-Amant, 2008</xref>). This method could not be used to estimate climatic data for the second-generation seed orchards because they are composed of trees of many different origins from the provinces of Québec and Ontario; moreover, temperature and precipitation “mean provenances values” would not be representative of the climatic conditions of the orchards sites, and would not permit the determination of accurate correlations between performance and climatic conditions.
