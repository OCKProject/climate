<p class="p">After two growing seasons in forest nursery (2+0), seedlings of the same seedlots were planted on three planting forest sites in eastern Québec, covering three bioclimatic domains (

 </bold>). The average seedling characteristics of each seed orchard were assessed before planting. Average values for height (33.5 cm-41.9 cm), total mass (11.9 g–15.5 g) and shoot nitrogen content (1.5%-1.68%) were calculated from a sample of 15 seedlings/orchard. The field tests were established on May 28-29, 2013 in Watford township in the Beauce region (46.3°N 70.4°W, Sugar maple- yellow birch domain), June 4-6, 2013, in Asselin township in the Témiscouata valley (47.84°N 68.52°W, Balsam fir yellow birch domain) and June 11-13 in Deville township on the Gaspé peninsula (48.62°N 65.72°W, Balsam fir-white birch domain). The first site (Watford) simulates a transfer to the southern limit of the optimal continuous distribution zone of white spruce, which is a minor component of forest stands (depending on the location, white spruce represents between 0 to 7% of the forest cover in the maple domain). The second (Asselin) and third (Deville) sites simulate seed source transfer inside the continuous natural distribution of the species (between 7 and 30% of the forest cover in these domains is comprised of white spruce). Textural analyses of the soil revealed the presence of loamy soils for the Watford and Asselin sites and a clay-loam soil in Deville. For each site, four complete blocks were established with the eight seed sources randomly distributed in 27 m
