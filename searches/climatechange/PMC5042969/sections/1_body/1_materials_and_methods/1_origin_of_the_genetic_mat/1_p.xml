<p class="p">White spruce seedlings used in this study originated from six first-generation and two second-generation seed orchards. The seed orchards were chosen in accordance with their contribution and use in the reforestation program of the Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs of Québec. The first-generation seed orchards were established for each reforestation region using grafts of plus-trees (Superior phenotypes to the surrounding trees in the stand) selected from local natural stands (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beaulieu et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, each of these orchards must be considered as a representative of the surrounding local natural population. Taken together, they were representative of a territory located between 45°N and 50°N of latitude and between 57° and 79°W of longitude. The second-generation seed orchards were established using grafts of plus-trees selected in the top-performing open-pollinated families assessed in a range-wide provenance-progeny test replicated on eight sites. These superior families are from across Québec and Ontario. These seed orchards provide genetically improved seed for the reforestation of two major zones in Québec, respectively, located south and north of approximately 47°N latitude (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 1997</xref>), and representing the sugar maple and the balsam fir bioclimatic domains, respectively. The orchards selected for this study were numbered 1 to 8 (SO1 to SO8), according to their increasing latitude of location (
