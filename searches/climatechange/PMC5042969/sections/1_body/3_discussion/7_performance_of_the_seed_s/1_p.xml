<p class="p">The results obtained during the establishment phase, that is, at the end of the first growing season on the reforestation sites, revealed a very high survival rate and complete absence of frost damage on the three different planting sites. Though it must be validated on multiple years, this trend suggests adequate acclimatization and adaptation of the different seed sources to the climatic conditions encountered in the three bioclimatic domains. The absence of observed mortality on the three planting sites during the establishment phase is likely related to the high phenotypic plasticity of white spruce (
