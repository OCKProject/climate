<p class="p">The transfer of forest tree seed sources has been practiced for a long time (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wright, 1976</xref>). But the use of this approach as an operational means of adapting plantations to climate change is a concept that has attracted much attention over the past 10 years (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hewitt et al., 2011</xref>) and even before, where planting programs of non-local seed sources in this context had already been advocated in the early 1990s (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ledig and Kitzmiller, 1992</xref>). At the international scale, several research projects have been conducted or are presently underway to take advantage of intraspecific variation in order to better face the anticipated effects of climate change: by evaluating the effect of transferring genetic resources within the limits of species natural distributions (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thomson and Parker, 2008</xref>), but also for testing the movement of species over long distances beyond their current natural distributions. For instance, in Canada, a vast project involving 16 species from British Columbia, and the states of Washington, Oregon and Idaho was launched to assess the performance of seed sources transferred to high latitudes in the Yukon as well as study the tolerance of northern sources to global warming by planting them at lower latitudes in California (
