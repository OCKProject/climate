<p class="p">For first-generation seed orchard seedlings, we observed that height at the end of the second growing season was related to three local growing season temperature variables characterizing the origin of the various seed sources. Height was negatively correlated with the mean growing season temperature and length of growing season, but positively correlated to the mean temperature of the month of July. Contrary to results previously observed for 45 white spruce seed sources in Québec used for modeling the outcomes of four climate change scenarios (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Andalo et al., 2005</xref>), the performance of the present seed sources was not linked to precipitation variables. This could be due to a larger range of longitude sampled in the previous study, which extended westward to Ontario. Our results are also in line with those of 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hornoy et al. (2015)</xref>, who reported much fewer significant correlations between gene allelic diversity and precipitation than with temperature among white spruce natural populations mostly from Québec. At the same time, the adaptation of the seed sources to the local climatic conditions of their origin may have favored the growth of seed sources originating from orchards in proximity of the nursery where the study was conducted. This could partially explain the inferior height growth of white spruce seedlings from orchards in the west and north-east of Québec, where the climate is cooler. For this reason, it would be appropriate to repeat the study by characterizing the same seed sources in nurseries located in northern and/or western Québec.
