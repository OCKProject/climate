<p class="p">At the end of the second growing season (2+0), the mean foliar nitrogen for the seedlings from the eight orchards (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 1.6 ± 0.1 %) was within the required range of 1.4 to 2.2% nitrogen, to ensure the survival and good growth of containerized conifer seedlings (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landis, 1989</xref>). It has been shown that, for large size white spruce seedlings, a foliar nitrogen concentration higher than 1.5% results in adequate net photosynthetic rates and good root regeneration, thus allowing adequate growth and survival rates after outplanting (
