<p class="p">The results of the cluster analysis also seem to imply that seed zones could be merged. For instance, SO4 and SO5 could likely supply seed for a large area in northwest Québec. Likely, SO6 and SO8 could supply seed for the reforestation of the Gaspé Peninsula and the St. Lawrence North Shore region. Finally, all the southern parts of the province of Québec covered by the sugar maple bioclimatic domain could likely be supplied by both SO1 and SO3, but also by the second-generation seed orchard SO2. These results are, however, too early to make final decision about the merging of seed zones, but they constitute a solid basis for potential future assisted migration decisions. These results are also in agreement with the early findings of
