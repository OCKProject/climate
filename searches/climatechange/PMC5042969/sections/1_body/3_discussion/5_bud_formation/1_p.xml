<p class="p">Our results, obtained under uniform environmental conditions of temperature, precipitation and photoperiod in the nursery, revealed that seedlings from north-eastern seed sources (SO6 and SO8), which exhibited smaller growth than other sources, set their buds four days earlier than those from southern and second generation orchards (

 </bold>), resulting in an earlier cessation of height growth in seedlings from northeastern sources. Furthermore, from a study of 3-year old nursery grown white spruce seedlings from 57 provenances in Québec and Ontario, it has been reported that taller seedlings entered dormancy later, on average, than shorter ones (

Thus, for spruces in Québec, these results indicate that the growing season is generally longer for seed sources displaying higher growth, which are those generally originating from more southern latitudes. It implies that these sources are genetically conditioned to exploit better the more favorable growing conditions encountered under these latitudes. It suggests that under warming conditions, these seed sources would be better adapted than local ones, as also inferred by
