<p class="p">By evaluating the functional traits of seedlings from different genetic seed sources used in Qu√©bec in different growing conditions, the aim of this study was to help build the scientific foundation for operational seed source transfer in the context of climate change, also called assisted migration. This approach combined the assessment of morpho-physiological responses of different white spruce seed sources in both forest nurseries located in the natural range of the species, and on different planting sites that simulate various climatic transfers of seed sources. The evaluation of these responses at an early stage is also motivated by the fact that the establishment phase of future plantations and forests represents a critical step (
