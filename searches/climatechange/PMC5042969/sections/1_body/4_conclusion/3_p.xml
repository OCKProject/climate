<p class="p">It also appears to be important to pursue a medium-term evaluation, in space and time, of the productivity of plantations made up of seedlings from diverse seed sources in relation to variations in climate (temperature, precipitations, length of growing season, etc.) and to evaluate the morpho-physiological reaction of different seed sources in response to the multiple interactions with different sources of environmental stress. This information will contribute, over the long term, to assess whether the adopted assisted mitigation strategy, based on knowledge acquired through morpho-physiological research, has been effective.</p>
