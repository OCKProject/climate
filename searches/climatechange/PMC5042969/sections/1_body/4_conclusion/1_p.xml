<p class="p">The morpho-physiological characterization of white spruce seedlings from eight seed sources both under nursery conditions during their first and second growing seasons (1+0 and 2+0) and after 1 year of growth on three reforestation sites allowed for a rapid evaluation of their growth potential during the juvenile stage, which is critical for their successful establishment. In addition to permitting an early selection of genetic material based on a combination of observed performance in the nursery and on forest planting sites, the originality of our results resides in the illustration, for first-generation seed orchards, of the significant relationship between height at the end of the second growing season and the local climate at the site of seed orchard origin, notably the average growing season temperature, temperature during the month of July and the length of the growing season. Given that these seed orchards were each made up of genetic selections in local natural populations, in order to meet local needs of improved seed, these correlations suggest that these climatic parameters could be taken into consideration when choosing reforestation sites in order to match genetic potential and facilitate seedling adaptation. The different morpho-physiological responses observed in the relatively controlled nursery environment are likely attributable to the expression of the full genetic potential of the different seed sources. Combined with transfer models, these differences in morpho-physiological responses will help define new seed transfer zones that should help ensure the adaptation of white spruce plantations in the context of climate change in Qu√©bec.</p>
