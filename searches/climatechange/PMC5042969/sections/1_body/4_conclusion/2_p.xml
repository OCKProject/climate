<p class="p">The approach of the present study, which combines nursery and forest planting site growth assessments, has practical implications for reforestation. The medium and long-term evaluations of different seed sources on different plantation sites will contribute to the selection of best adapted seed sources, depending on the amplitude of the transfer (within, at the margin of the natural distribution of the species, or over longer distances). It will help optimize the implementation of the choice of genetic resources in the context of assisted migration by maximizing, over the short term, the compatibility between the climate observed at the location of origin of the seed sources and the choice of potential planting sites based on the climate variables that were revealed to be the most significant in the present study. It will also help identify the seed sources (e.g., orchards and breeding populations) that are best adapted to current and future climatic conditions. The combination of these different results will further help clarify the ecological amplitude of use for each seed orchard and generate maps for transfer and suitability of reforestation sites for each seed source.</p>
