   <bold class="bold">Identification, location and geographic coordinates of the eight white spruce seed orchards in the province of Quebec as well as the location of the Saint-Modeste forest tree nursery where the seedlings were raised for their first two growing seasons.</bold> The orchards are identified from 1 to 8, in order of increasing latitude. Geoclimatic data of the centroid of selected trees from local provenances that make up the first-generation white spruce seed orchards were also indicated. Climatic data for the second-generation seed orchards (SO2 and SO7) are not determined because they are composed of trees representing multiple provenances from the province of Qu√©bec and Ontario. A description of bioclimatic domains can be found in
