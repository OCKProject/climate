   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Growth curves for height of white spruce seedlings from eight seed orchards (SO1 to SO8) during their second growing season (2+0) in a forest tree nursery. Measurements were taken bi-weekly (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 25). 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Height growth curves for the five orchard groups (G17 [group comprised of SO1 and SO7], G2, G3, G45 [group comprised of SO4 and S05], and G68 [group comprised of SO6 and SO8]) modeled using a logistical growth model. The orchards were grouped with respect to three seedling growth traits measured at the end of the second growing season (2+0). 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Height growth curves for the seedlings of three orchard groups (G1723, G45, and G68) modeled using a logistical growth model. The orchards were grouped from the five groups that had previously been assembled based on similar growth parameters of different fitted logistical models (see text).
