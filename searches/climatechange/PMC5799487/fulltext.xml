The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has determined that NPS is the primary cause of water pollution in the United States in the 21st century<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. In China, with the increasing prevalence of NPS caused by agricultural activities, the earliest large-scale nonpoint source pollution in the warm southern regions have been extended to the cold northern regions. China&#x02019;s northeast regions are affected by the geographical conditions, the climate is cold and precipitation is unevenly distributed, leading to the loss of nonpoint source pollution is special<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Winter freezing phenomenon promotes the mineralization and denitrification of nitrogen and phosphorus, and a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants are accumulated in the soil. The snowmelt by winter snowfalls contributes considerably to water resources in these cold areas, and supplies a concentrate amount of nonpoint source nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants during spring period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. This shows that nonpoint source pollution is cumulative and sudden in the cold regions. However, it&#x02019;s difficult to quantitative analysis of nonpoint source pollution in snowmelt period because of the insufficient spatial snow information and complexity of the physical snowmelt and runoff processes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Nowadays, human activities such as primarily the burning of fossil fuels and changes of land use are known to increase the greenhouse gases concentration, which will lead to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Studies indicate that the trend of China&#x02019;s future climate change in temperature will increase in all seasons, especially in winter. Precipitation in the southwest will show an increasing trend while a decreasing trend in the northeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. So the climate is warm and dry obviously in cold areas. As climate change appearance has affected hydrological cycle by increasing precipitation, temperature and evaporation process, it will result in various problems of water resource and water quality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. In cold areas, while snowfall during the winter melt in early spring with the temperature rises, causing water environment deterioration increase due to nonpoint source pollution concentrate outflow in spring<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Therefore, a quantitative assessment the impacts of climate change on nonpoint source pollution in snowmelt period is an important way to solve this problem<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">At present, many studies have assessment the effects of climate change on the water quantity, but few studies have done on the impact of water quality. Nohara <italic>et al</italic>. (2006) investigated streamflow change of global main big rivers using the General Circulation Models (GCMs), the results show that the streamflow will increase in future under the SRES A1B scenario<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Tahir <italic>et al</italic>. (2010) simulated the climate change effects on snowmelt runoff under different climate scenarios in a large mountainous watershed in Northern Pakistan by employing the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM), which is based on a simple degree-day method for snowmelt simulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Crossman (2013) applied the coupled model of HBV and INCA-P to forecast the impact of climate change on phosphorus migration and transformation in the Black River basin in Canada, the results show that the future precipitation and temperature will increase, so that the total phosphorus load shows an increasing trend, especially in winter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">Many studies used GCMs coupled with hydrological model to simulate the potential effects of climate change on streamflow and water quality under different conditions. Based on different climate scenarios, climate factors such as precipitation and temperature will be generated and used as inputs to the hydrological model to predict water quality pollution in future. Saet <italic>et al</italic>. (2015) used the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and multi-GCM to evaluate future climate changes impacts on snowmelt streamflow and water pollution load in a mountainous high-elevation watershed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Due to the differences in spatial and temporal resolution between GCMs and hydrological models, statistical or dynamical downscaling methods are often used to bridge this gap. Gulacha (2017) projected the climate change under SRES A2 and B2 scenarios in the Wami-Ruvu River basin using Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) to reduce the coarse scales of HadCM3 outputs to local scales by involving predictor predict and relationship<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. As a widely popular method, hydrological models in combination with downscaled GCMs are usually used to project impacts of water resource under climate change scenarios at hydrological cycle scale.</p><p id="Par6">Liao River source area is an important grain growing area in China, experiences serious problems with agricultural NPS that impact the regional economy and society<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The watershed is located in China&#x02019;s northeastern cold region, unique climate conditions lead particularly to nonpoint source pollution, and NPS will change due to global climate change. This study attempts to analyze the change of nonpoint source pollution loads during annual and snowmelt period in the source area of Liao River under different climate change scenarios using SWAT model, SDSM and GCM. After the SWAT model is established by carrying out sensitivity analysis on the snowmelt parameters, the model is applied to assess the impact of future climate change on the streamflow and the nutrients loads under two scenarios (HadGEM3 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).

The soil data was obtained from the second soil survey in Jilin Province. Daily meteorological data such as 24&#x02009;h daily precipitation, maximum/minimum temperatures, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity, required by the SWAT model was obtained from the China Meteorological data sharing service network<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup> and five meteorological stations. Runoff, sediment and nonpoint source pollution input data was provided by the three hydrological stations. Five meteorological stations and three hydrological stations were located at Changchun, Siping, Shuangliao, Liaoyuan, Erlongshan Reservoir, Quantai, Wangben, and Lishu as shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>. The period of dataset in the weather stations was 1961&#x02013;2010. The daily NCEP reanalysis data were used as the observed daily data of large-scale weather predictor factors to establish the statistical downscaling models during the period of 1961&#x02013;2000. HadGEM3 RCP4.5 and HadGEM3 RCP8.5 were used to produce future climate change scenarios obtained from Global Climate Change Committee IPCC Data Center.

In this study, snowmelt parameters initial ranges were suggested by the SWAT-CUP software, and considered to be typical ranges in the source area of Liao River. The ranges of snowmelt parameters were divided into 10 increments, and each incremental value was then tested. When one parameter was varied, the others were fixed at the mean values of the corresponding ranges. The values for R<sup>2</sup> and NS were computed for the increments, a parameter was empirically considered sensitive if its variation resulted in a change in R<sup>2</sup> and NS of more than zero.</p><p id="Par33">According to the above sensitivity analysis method of the snowmelt parameters, five snowmelt parameters (SFTMP, SMTMP, SMFMX, SMFMN, and TIMP) were considered sensitive and taken as calibration parameters while SNOCOVMX and SNO50COV were considered insensitive. According to the maximum values of R<sup>2</sup> and NS, the optimum value range of snowmelt parameters were determined for Dongliao River and Zhaosutai River, respectively.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC, 2013)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> has published new climate change scenarios based on four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with an indicator of the total radiative forcing values in 2100.

The RCP2.6 scenario limits the global warming range to less than 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, with lower greenhouse gas emissions, producing the maximum of atmospheric radiative forcing in the middle of this century, and slowly dropping to 2.6&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> by 2100. The RCP4.5 scenario represents countries of the world will make efforts to achieve targets of greenhouse gas emission reduction, stabilizing atmospheric radiative forcing at 4.5&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> by the end of this century. The RCP6.0 scenario represents countries of the world don&#x02019;t make full efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stabilizing atmospheric radiative forcing at 6.0&#x02009;W/m<sup>2</sup> by the end of this century.
