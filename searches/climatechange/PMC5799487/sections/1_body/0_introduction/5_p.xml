 </sup>. The watershed is located in China’s northeastern cold region, unique climate conditions lead particularly to nonpoint source pollution, and NPS will change due to global climate change. This study attempts to analyze the change of nonpoint source pollution loads during annual and snowmelt period in the source area of Liao River under different climate change scenarios using SWAT model, SDSM and GCM. After the SWAT model is established by carrying out sensitivity analysis on the snowmelt parameters, the model is applied to assess the impact of future climate change on the streamflow and the nutrients loads under two scenarios (HadGEM3 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5).
