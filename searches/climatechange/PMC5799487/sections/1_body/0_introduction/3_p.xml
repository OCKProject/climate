 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2006) investigated streamflow change of global main big rivers using the General Circulation Models (GCMs), the results show that the streamflow will increase in future under the SRES A1B scenario

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2010) simulated the climate change effects on snowmelt runoff under different climate scenarios in a large mountainous watershed in Northern Pakistan by employing the Snowmelt Runoff Model (SRM), which is based on a simple degree-day method for snowmelt simulation

 </sup>. Crossman (2013) applied the coupled model of HBV and INCA-P to forecast the impact of climate change on phosphorus migration and transformation in the Black River basin in Canada, the results show that the future precipitation and temperature will increase, so that the total phosphorus load shows an increasing trend, especially in winter
