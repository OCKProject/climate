<p id="Par2" class="p">Nonpoint source pollution (NPS) is a great concern due to its impacts on water environment pollution and water quality deterioration. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) has determined that NPS is the primary cause of water pollution in the United States in the 21st century

 </sup>. In China, with the increasing prevalence of NPS caused by agricultural activities, the earliest large-scale nonpoint source pollution in the warm southern regions have been extended to the cold northern regions. China’s northeast regions are affected by the geographical conditions, the climate is cold and precipitation is unevenly distributed, leading to the loss of nonpoint source pollution is special

 </sup>. Winter freezing phenomenon promotes the mineralization and denitrification of nitrogen and phosphorus, and a large amount of nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants are accumulated in the soil. The snowmelt by winter snowfalls contributes considerably to water resources in these cold areas, and supplies a concentrate amount of nonpoint source nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants during spring period

 </sup>. This shows that nonpoint source pollution is cumulative and sudden in the cold regions. However, it’s difficult to quantitative analysis of nonpoint source pollution in snowmelt period because of the insufficient spatial snow information and complexity of the physical snowmelt and runoff processes
