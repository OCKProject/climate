 </inline-formula>90 m. The types and spatial distribution of land use was obtained from Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) and ETM (Enhanced Thematic Mapper) image data in 2008. The soil data was obtained from the second soil survey in Jilin Province. Daily meteorological data such as 24 h daily precipitation, maximum/minimum temperatures, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity, required by the SWAT model was obtained from the China Meteorological data sharing service network

 </sup> and five meteorological stations. Runoff, sediment and nonpoint source pollution input data was provided by the three hydrological stations. Five meteorological stations and three hydrological stations were located at Changchun, Siping, Shuangliao, Liaoyuan, Erlongshan Reservoir, Quantai, Wangben, and Lishu as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>. The period of dataset in the weather stations was 1961–2010. The daily NCEP reanalysis data were used as the observed daily data of large-scale weather predictor factors to establish the statistical downscaling models during the period of 1961–2000. HadGEM3 RCP4.5 and HadGEM3 RCP8.5 were used to produce future climate change scenarios obtained from Global Climate Change Committee IPCC Data Center. Data is extracted for the current climate and future scenarios in the period of 1961–2100.
