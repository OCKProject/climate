<p id="Par38" class="p">The selection of large-scale weather predictor factors largely determines the character of the downscaled climate scenario when applying SDSM. Observed daily data of large-scale weather predictor factors derived from NCEP reanalysis dataset represent 500 hPa, 850 hPa and 1000 hPa atmospheric humidity, airflow intensity and radiation etc. In this paper, according to the actual climatic conditions and previous research results, all of the twenty-six factors and the selected factors are shown in the shadow part of TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>. Among of them, four large-scale precipitation predictor factors including mean sea level pressure, 500 hPa geostrophic airflow velocity, 500 hPa relative humidity and 850 hPa relative humidity, and four large-scale temperature predictor factors including mean sea level pressure, 500 hPa radiation, 850 hPa geopotential height and 1000 hPa vorticity were selected.
