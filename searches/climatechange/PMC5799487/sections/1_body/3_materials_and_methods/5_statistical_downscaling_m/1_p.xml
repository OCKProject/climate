<p id="Par36" class="p">GCMs were designed to predict large-scale atmospheric circulation changes in the future. The outputs of climate information were large in spatial and temporal scale and low resolution relatively, which couldnâ€™t provide a direct estimation of hydrological response to climate change. The GCM outputs need to be converted into a reliable precipitation and temperature data series at the watershed scale. The downscaling method is used to solve the problem of the spatial and temporal resolution gaps between GCMs and hydrological research. In this research, statistical downscaling model (SDSM) is used to generate precipitation and temperature series in future
