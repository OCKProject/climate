 </sup> has published new climate change scenarios based on four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) with an indicator of the total radiative forcing values in 2100. Among all RCPs scenarios, four scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) are commonly used. The RCP2.6 scenario limits the global warming range to less than 2 °C, with lower greenhouse gas emissions, producing the maximum of atmospheric radiative forcing in the middle of this century, and slowly dropping to 2.6 W/m
