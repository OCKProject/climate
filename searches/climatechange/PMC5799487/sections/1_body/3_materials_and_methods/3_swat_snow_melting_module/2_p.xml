<p id="Par32" class="p">In the SWAT snow melting module, seven snowmelt parameters (SFTMP, SMTMP, SMFMX, SMFMN, TIMP, SNOCOVMX, and SNO50COV) on snowmelt hydrology were changed with a certain range in order to determine model sensitivity in simulations. In this study, snowmelt parameters initial ranges were suggested by the SWAT-CUP software, and considered to be typical ranges in the source area of Liao River. The ranges of snowmelt parameters were divided into 10 increments, and each incremental value was then tested. When one parameter was varied, the others were fixed at the mean values of the corresponding ranges. The values for R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and NS were computed for the increments, a parameter was empirically considered sensitive if its variation resulted in a change in R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and NS of more than zero.
