<p id="Par33" class="p">According to the above sensitivity analysis method of the snowmelt parameters, five snowmelt parameters (SFTMP, SMTMP, SMFMX, SMFMN, and TIMP) were considered sensitive and taken as calibration parameters while SNOCOVMX and SNO50COV were considered insensitive. According to the maximum values of R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and NS, the optimum value range of snowmelt parameters were determined for Dongliao River and Zhaosutai River, respectively. The best range of both SMFMX and SMFMN varied from 18 to 20 mm H
