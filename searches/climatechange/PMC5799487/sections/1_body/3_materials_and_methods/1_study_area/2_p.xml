 </sup>. During the farming period, along with the use of fertilizers and pesticides concentrated, nonpoint source pollution is serious. In addition, due to the global warming and the temperature rising, leading to the snow melting in advance and rainfall increasing. Precipitation (rainfall and snowmelt) as the driving force, resulting in nitrogen and phosphorus pollutants migrate from soil to the surface water and groundwater, causing deterioration of water quality. As a consequence, the measured discharge and nonpoint source pollution is the result of climatic and human impacts. In order to address the water quality issues, it is necessary to assessment of future climate change impacts on NPS in the Liao River source area.
