<p id="Par25" class="p">Using HadGEM3 of GCMs, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate change scenarios were applied to the watershed and future progection results were arranged for the 2020 s (2021–2040), 2050 s (2041–2070) and 2080 s (2071–2100) using the baseline (1961–2000). The results show that the Liao River source area tends to become warmer in the future under two scenarios. Annual average temperature will rise by 2.1 °C in the 2080 s under scenario RCP8.5, and by 1.3 °C under scenario RCP4.5. At the same time, annual precipitation will increase by 67 mm and 33 mm under both scenarios. Seasonal temperature and precipitation increases are different for each time and scenario. The change in winter temperature and precipitation is most significant with an increase by 0.23 °C/10a (0.17 °C/10a) and 1.94 mm/10a (2.78 mm/10a) in the 2080 s under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5). This result is different from the response in south Korea
