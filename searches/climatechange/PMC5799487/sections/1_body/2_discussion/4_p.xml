<p id="Par27" class="p">In this study, a semi-distributed simulation and prediction model of nonpoint source pollution considering snow melting module was constructed compared with previous studies. Even though the results of this study give reasonable conclusion for the future climate change impact on hydrology and water quality, there may be other factors that need to be considered, such as the impact by the future landuse change and the changes of soil environment. In addition, snowmelt mechanism considering the litter fall and humus soil layer will also be improved, especially, the related snowmelt parameters will be obtained by remote sensing technology. These potential limitations of this study will be addressed in future studies. The results of this study have great potentials to aid watershed management, specifically to effective control of agricultural nonpoint source pollution, and improve the quality of water environment when under climate change scenarios. Research efforts will be conducted to save water and reduce nonpoint source pollution using river bank vegetation buffer belt under climate warming conditions.</p>
