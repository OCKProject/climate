<p id="Par24" class="p">In this study, projection of the potential climate change in temperature and precipitation and their impacts on nonpoint source pollution in snowmelt period were evaluated for the Liao River source area using SWAT. To improve the snow hydrology when incorporated in the snowmelt modeling process, seven snowmelt parameters in the SWAT snow melting module were selected for sensitivity analysis, and five snowmelt parameters (SFTMP, SMTMP, SMFMX, SMFMN, and TIMP) were considered sensitive. With the snow parameters, the SWAT model was calibrated and validated by monthly average flows, sediment, TN and TP data at Quantai and Lishu stations. The R

Downscaling is necessary when assessing the potential impacts of climate change in future at the regional scale using GCM simulations. To obtain reliable climate change series, the SDSM model was calibrated and validated by temperature and precipitation. The results show that downscaled precipitation and temperature series by SDSM can improve simulations of streamflow, TN and TP.
