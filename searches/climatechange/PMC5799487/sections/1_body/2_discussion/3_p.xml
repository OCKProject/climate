<p id="Par26" class="p">As a consequence of temperature and precipitation change, evaporation amounts will increase and result in streamflow decrease. while increasing the absorption rate on the nonpoint source nitrogen and phosphorus by vegetation, so that TN and TP loads will decrease. Relative to the baseline, annual average streamflow, TN and TP loads would decrease by 19.05%, 12.27% and 10.63% in the 2080â€‰s under scenario RCP8.5, and 10.59%, 8.81% and 6.11% under scenario RCP4.5, respectively. However, For monthly average streamflow, TN and TP loads will increase from December to February under both scenarios, earlier two or three months than baseline (March to May). The result is different from the response in northern USA and Canada
