<p id="Par22" class="p">To describe more clearly the change in seasonal average streamflow and nonpoint source pollution, the characteristics of future seasonal flow, TN and TP loads are analyzed by Mann-Kendall method as see in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>. During the baseline, under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) seasonal streamflow in spring, summer, autumn and winter are–0.77m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a (−0.56m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a),–0.81m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a (−0.62m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a),–0.67m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a (−0.41m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a), 0.53m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a (0.72m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/10a), respectively. It shows that the increase tendency of seasonal streamflow occurs in winter, and the decrease tendency are in spring, summer and autumn. This is due to the future temperature rising turn the snow to melt in advance and increase the snowmelt runoff in winter.
