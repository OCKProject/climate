<p id="Par19" class="p">The annual flow, TN and TP showed overall decreases in future, the reason was primarily increased evaporation caused by the increasing of temperature. In the future climate change, although the precipitation will be increasing, but the precipitation is mainly increased during the dry period, and the annual increase in precipitation is not significant. while the temperature will be rising, causing the evaporation intensified, which is the main reason for the decrease in streamflow. In addition, due to the increase of evaporation, the scouring ability of the surface runoff is weakened, and the loss of the nonpoint source nitrogen and phosphorus decreases with the surface runoff. At the same time, the increased temperature will promote the absorption rate of nitrogen and phosphorus in vegetation, which resulted in the decrease of TN and TP loads in the source area of Liao River.</p>
