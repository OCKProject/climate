<p id="Par17" class="p">In the cold area, rainfall and snowfall is part of the driving force of nonpoint source pollution, and the temperature has great influence on the migration and transformation of nonpoint source nitrogen and phosphorus. Therefore, climate change will affect nonpoint source pollution through changing the hydrological cycle process on the watershed scale. The precipitation and temperature generated by SDSM under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were used as input to the SWAT model to predict the future climate change impact on runoff and nonpoint source pollution. The results indicate that it is reasonable to research hydrological and contaminated impacts of climate change in the future using SWAT and SDSM. Therefore, this study only predicts possible hydrological and contaminated responses under climate change scenarios, without making deterministic predictions.</p>
