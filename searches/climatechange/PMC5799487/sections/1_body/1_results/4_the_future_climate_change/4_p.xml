A wide range of streamflow change in different months and under the two scenarios is anticipated. It shows that a downward trend of flow in most months, streamflow will decrease from March to November but increase from December to February in three time periods under both scenarios, and the most decreasing occur in March and July. This may due to the large increase of temperatures in winter, prompting the snow to melt earlier, resulting in the increasing trends of streamflow from December to February. So that the original streamflow generated by snowmelt flow will reduce in March, and the decreasing trend is very obvious.
