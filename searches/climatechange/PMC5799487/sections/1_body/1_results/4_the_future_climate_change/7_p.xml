<p id="Par23" class="p">During the baseline, under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) seasonal TN are–3.47t/10a (−2.97 t/10a),–4.19 t/10a (−3.02 t/10a),–2.21 t/10a (−1.58t/10a), 1.12 t/10a (1.81t/10a), and TP are–0.45t/10a (−0.39 t/10a),–0.51 t/10a (−0.42 t/10a),–0.24 t/10a (−0.15t/10a), 0.39 t/10a (0.5t/10a) in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. TN and TP loads will decrease in almost all seasons except an increase in winter. It shows that nonpoint source pollution will increase with the increasing of snowmelt runoff in winter.</p>
