<p id="Par18" class="p">After the evaluation of future precipitation and temperature, the impact of future climate change on water quality was evaluated in terms of Flow, TN and TP at the watershed outlet. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> summarizes the percent changes of future annual Flow, TN and TP loads for the two climate change scenarios. The results show that with a gradual increase in annual precipitation and temperature, annual average streamflow is likely to decrease about by 3.74% (1.70%), 10.76% (5.18%) and 19.05% (10.59%) in the 2020 s, 2050 s and 2080 s under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) relative to the baseline. In the same time slices, annual TN and TP loads decrease by 3.17% (1.82%), 6.84% (4.05%), 12.27% (8.81%), and by 2.32% (1.14%), 6.40% (3.79%), 10.63% (6.11%) under RCP8.5 (RCP4.5), respectively. Accordingly, the future Flow, TN and TP decreased for two scenarios as it goes to 2080 s compared to baseline, and RCP8.5 scenario decreased largely than RCP4.5 scenarios.
