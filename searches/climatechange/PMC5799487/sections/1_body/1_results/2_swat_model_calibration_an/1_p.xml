<p id="Par9" class="p">In order to evaluate the impact of future climatic change on nonpoint source pollution, The SWAT model was established for the three small watersheds in the source area of Liao River including the Dongliao, Zhaosutai and Tiaozi river watersheds. Usually, most studies use calibrated parameters based on the assumption that the change in processes will be small in comparison with the changes for climatic conditions. So the first step of this study was to calibrate and validate the SWAT model using the optimum value range of determined snowmelt parameters. The calibration period was 2006–2008 and the validation period was 2009–2010 for Quantai station (on the Dongliao River) and Lishu station (on the Zhaosutai River).</p>
