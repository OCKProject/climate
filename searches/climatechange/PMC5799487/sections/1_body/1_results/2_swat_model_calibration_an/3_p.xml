<p id="Par11" class="p">With the help of the snowmelt parameters sensitivity analysis, the snowmelt module is considered in the SWAT simulation. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> shows the value of R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and NS using the snowmelt parameters (SFTMP, MTMP, MFMX, SMFMN, TIMP) or not during the snowmelt period (November–April). Subsequently, the results of optimal range for snowmelt parameters, both R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and NS of flows, sediments and nonpoint source pollution simulation are higher than those of the defaulted snowmelt parameters. It shows that consider the snowmelt module can improve the accuracy of the SWAT model for the snowmelt process.
