 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, respectively. The correlation coefficient (R

 </sup>. It shows that the simulated results are satisfactory given the level of accuracy of the predicted monthly average daily flows, monthly total sediment discharge and monthly total nonpoint source nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) exports. It was considered that the established SWAT model can reflect the real pollutant output in the study area.
