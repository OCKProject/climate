<p id="Par14" class="p">The change of monthly precipitation is more complicated than the temperature. Precipitation increases significantly by 0.22 mm/d–0.39 mm/d during the dry period (from September to April) in the three time slices, and decreases by 0.08 mm/d–0.35 mm/d during the wet period (from May to August) for both scenarios. However, the largest decrease of precipitation occurred in July, except for the RCP8.5 scenarios in the 2080 s.</p>
