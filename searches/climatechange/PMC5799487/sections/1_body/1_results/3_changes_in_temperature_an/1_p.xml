<p id="Par12" class="p">Precipitation and temperature are the two dominant factors affecting runoff and nonpoint source pollution in the watershed scale when the climate changes. Based on the SDSM, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenarios provided by HadGEM3 were used as input to the model to predict the future trends of precipitation and temperature in the source area of Liaohe River. The results of climate changes are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. Under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) annual average temperature is likely to rise by 06 °C (0.3 °C) in the 2020 s (2021–2040), by 1.2 °C (0.7 °C) in the 2050 s (2041–2070), and by 2.1 °C (1.3 °C) in the 2080 s (2071–2100) relative to the baseline (1961–2000). Under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) and in the same time slices, annual precipitation increases by 20 mm (9 mm), 39 mm (−6 mm) and 67 mm (33 mm), respectively. Accordingly, the future precipitation and temperature increased for two scenarios as it goes to 2080 s compared to baseline, and RCP8.5 scenario increased largely than RCP4.5 scenarios.
