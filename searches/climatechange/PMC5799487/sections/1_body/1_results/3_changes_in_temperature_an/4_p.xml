<p id="Par15" class="p">The characteristics of future seasonal precipitation and temperature are analyzed by Mann-Kendall method as see in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. During the baseline, Under scenario RCP8.5 (RCP4.5) seasonal temperature rises by 0.08 °C/10a (0.07 °C/10a), 0.13 °C/10a (0.04 °C/10a), 0.12 °C/10a (0.06 °C/10a), 0.23 °C/10a (0.17 °C/10a) in spring, summer, autumn and winter respectively. Under both scenarios, seasonal temperature contributions are different, the descending order of seasonal temperature is winter, summer, autumn and spring, so winter temperature increase is the most obviously. In other words, the annual average temperature rises in the study area is mainly due to the increase in winter temperature.
