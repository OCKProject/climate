It shows that the trends of monthly temperature are similar to annual trends. Average temperature rise by 1.34 °C/d– 3 °C/d in most of the month under two scenarios, with the highest rise from December to February. However, only in April (2020 s) under RCP8.5 scenarios and in August and October (2020 s) under RCP4.5 scenarios, the average temperature drops down.
