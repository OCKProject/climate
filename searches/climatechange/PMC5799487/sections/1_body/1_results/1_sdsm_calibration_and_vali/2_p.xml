<p id="Par8" class="p">The calibration and validation of SDSM was provided in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> respectively. It shows that SDSM can generate precipitation and temperature monthly time-series under climate change scenarios, and monthly temperature is better generated by SDSM than monthly precipitation, because SDSM has certain limitations to downscale the precipitation regime. However, the simulation results of precipitation and temperature data is acceptable, and the simulations of Changchun and Shuangliao station is better than Siping station. Monthly and annual discharge change were simulated by SWAT.
