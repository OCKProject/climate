<p id="Par7" class="p">The statistical relationship between large-scale weather predictor factors and regional meteorological factors in the source area of Liao River was found by using SDSM. SDSM were established by utilizing the NCEP reanalysis data and the observed precipitation/temperature data of each meteorological station. To evaluate the performance of SDSM, the observations and simulations of monthly average precipitation, monthly average temperature, monthly maximum temperature and monthly minimum temperature in three meteorological stations were calculated and compared, including Changchun, Siping and Shuangliao stations. The series of 1961â€“2000 station data and NCEP data are used for model calibration and validation, the calibration period was from 1961 to 1990, and the validation period was from 1991 to 2000.</p>
