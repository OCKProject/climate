<p class="p">The new statistically defined palaeo-biomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) represent “snapshots” of land surface cover at a particular time during the Eocene and Oligocene. It is therefore possible that our Rupelian and Priabonian biome reconstructions could have missed climate change at the EOT, if it was not a major one-step change but rather a short-term cooling event that was followed by a return to warmer pre-EOT levels
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. In order to capture such a transient short term event, we focussed our analyses on selected samples with a sufficient time-resolution across the EOT and applied the Jaccard Similarity coefficient to compare the similarity between each sample

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). If the EOT caused a short term latitudinal shift in vegetation this will be reflected in the pollen assemblage at each of these sites through a decrease in the Jaccard Similarity coefficient. However, the Jaccard Similarity coefficient of pollen assemblages remains unchanged or increases, indicating equal or increased similarity of vegetation before, at and after the EOT in six out of eleven localities: southern Australia (N11), tropical South America (N9), the North Atlantic realm (N2, N3 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), southern North America (N7) and western Kamchatka (N4). In southern North America (N7) and North Atlantic (ODP 913, N3), the Jaccard Similarity of pollen assemblages decreases during the Late Eocene well before the EOT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Decreasing Jaccard Similarity of pollen assemblages at ca 33.5 Ma are recorded in the Paris Basin (N8), central Asia (N6), and in the Labrador Sea (N1, N5), suggesting a change in vegetation at the EOT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). In the Paris Basin this change in similarity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) also coincides with decreasing pollen preservation due to taphonomic factors related to sea-level changes
