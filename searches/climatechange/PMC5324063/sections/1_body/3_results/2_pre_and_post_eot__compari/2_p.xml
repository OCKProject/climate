 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. No changes in palaeo-biome distribution between the Priabonian and Rupelian can be detected in South America, Africa or Australia. In South America the tropical evergreen forest biomes have strongly varying confidence levels, which are related to the dating accuracy of these records. Whilst the cool-temperate forest and cool-temperate shrublands of southern South America and the Antarctic Peninsula have low to medium-confidence due to limited dating controls and/or purely biostratigraphical focus of the respective study (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). During the Rupelian there is evidence for cool-temperate mixed forest around the Weddell Sea and the first evidence for tundra (high to very high-confidence) in east Antarctica at 75°S. Palynological data from the Priabonian are restricted to 60–68°S and show the presence of cool-temperate mixed forest and cool-temperate shrubland in Prydz Bay and around the Weddell Sea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In North America, the geographical distribution of palaeo-biomes only changes in the high-latitudes, where in the Rupelian a southward shift of the northernmost limit of warm-temperate mixed forest of approximately 5 degrees is recorded from a single low-confidence site (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). A similar response, indicating a potential cooling at the EOT, can be reconstructed for the North Atlantic region where a low-confidence record of paratropical/subtropical mixed forest extended north to 65.8°N during the Priabonian, but only to 56.7°N in the Rupelian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In Europe, palaeo-biomes representative of seasonal climates are restricted to the Iberian Peninsula and western France during the Priabonian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>); by the Rupelian these had expanded eastwards along the Mediterranean coast of France and there was the first occurrence of xerophytic shrubland on the coast of the central Mediterranean (high-confidence locality). In central Asia vegetation changed from Priabonian warm-temperate mixed forests to paratropical/subtropical mixed forests in the Rupelian at 61–65°N; this is the only locality of the 59 with both a Priabonian and Rupelian pollen assemblage to show a change in palaeo-biome (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). Whereas the opposite change was recorded in East Asia at 49°N (medium-confidence localities due to low dating resolution).
