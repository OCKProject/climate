<p class="p">A climate cooling at the EOT can be reconstructed from Central Asia (N8) and Gulf Coast North America (N9). Pre-EOT reconstructed MATR in Central Asia (N8) was 17.0–22.2 °C, by 34 Ma this reconstructed MATR narrows to 19.7–21.9 °C, giving increased confidence to the climate reconstruction immediately before the EOT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). At the EOT the reconstructed MATR for Central Asia was 17.0–18.4 °C demonstrating a difference in MATR between the latest Priabonian and the EOT of −1.3 to −4.9 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Reconstructed MATR for the Rupelian of Central Asia returns to a wider reconstructed range of 16.5–21.7 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). The Gulf Coast North America region (N9) has pre-EOT MATR reconstructions of 17.4–23.9 °C and MATR reconstructions at the EOT of 17.0–19.4 °C and 17.0–20.8 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) suggesting a cooling in the region of 0.4–4.5 °C. Reconstructed MATRs for the Rupelian are 18.4–19.7 °C, with only one low-confidence record of 13.3–23.9 °C possibly suggesting a return to pre-EOT MATRs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Other regions which might show cooling across the EOT, but lack sufficient dating control, include northeast Asia (N6), western North America (N7), East Asia (N10) and southern West Atlantic (N12). In northeast Asia (N6) MATR appears to cool during the Priabonian from 18.3–19.7 °C to 13.8–14.0 °C, with temperatures at the EOT remaining at 13.8–14.0 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). However, all of these sites have low-confidence dating and as such it is difficult to know when the coldest MATR was reached (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). The northeast Asia region also shows a post-EOT warming with reconstructed MATR reaching 16.1–17.0 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Unfortunately, these sites continue to be low-confidence and as such it is unknown when exactly this warming occurred. Localities from western North America (N7) have a mixture of high to low-confidence dating, which makes identifying an interval of cooling complex (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Based on pollen assemblages with high-confidence dating it is possible to state that early Priabonian MATR was 16.4–20.8 °C, whilst MATR after 30 Ma is reconstructed as 11.6–18.4 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). In East Asia (N10) reconstructed MATRs for the Priabonian were 18.4–26.9 °C, whilst those for the Rupelian were 18.3–23.6 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Whilst there is considerable overlap of Priabonian and Rupelian MATRs from western North America and East Asia, both regions show a reduction in both the minimum and maximum value of the reconstructed CA range. This would suggest a climatic cooling, but uncertainty in dating prevents us from attributing it to the EOT. In southern West Atlantic (N12) MATR before 35 Ma is reconstructed as 15.5–18.4 °C; after 35 Ma, and for the remainder of the Priabonian, MATR was between 13.4–15.5 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). After the EOT, MATR reconstructions for southern West Atlantic (N12) are 11.7–13.7 °C and 15.5–23.4 °C demonstrating a degree of uncertainty in Rupelian climate in this region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Regions with a strong overlap of pre- and post EOT temperature ranges which do not allow identification of clear climate trends are northwest North America (N1), northwest Europe (N4) and the circum-Mediterranean (N5) (
