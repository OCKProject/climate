<p class="p">To identify potential seasonality changes across the EOT, we also reconstructed Cold Month Mean Temperature Ranges (CMMTR) and Warm Month Mean Temperature Ranges (WMMTR) for all regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref>). The CMMTR and WMMTR show a similar heterogeneous pattern to the MATRs. The CMMT declines at the EOT in Central Asia (N8) and Gulf Coast North America (N9), with possible EOT cooling (high uncertainty due to overlapping temporal ranges) in western North America (N7), East Asia (N10) and western South Atlantic (N13). Pre-EOT cooling of CMMTR are reconstructed for three regions: North Atlantic (N3), northeast Asia (N6) and southeast Australia (N15). No change in CMMTR is reconstructed for northeast North America (N2), the Mediterranean (N5), South America (N11, N13), Africa (N14), tropical Asia and India (N16). A post-EOT cooling of CMMTR occurred in the Mediterranean (N5) at around 31 Ma, which returned to preceding CMMTR levels by 29 Ma (

Only two regions have changes in CMMTR at the EOT and three regions have low-confidence changes in CMMTR at the EOT, our results contrast with previous studies suggesting a global-scale cooling of winter temperatures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. A decline of WMMTR at the EOT occurred in Central Asia (N8) and the Gulf Coast of North America (N9), whilst low-confidence EOT WMMTR cooling may have happened in western North America (N7) and western South Atlantic (N12) (

Pre-EOT decline in WMMTR are reconstructed for four regions: North Atlantic (N3), Mediterranean (N5), northeast Asia (N6) and southeast Australia (N15). Unchanging WMMTR is reconstructed for northeast North America (N2), east Asia (N10), South America (N11, N13), Africa (N14) and tropical Asia and India (N16) (
