<p class="p">Our terrestrial climate reconstructions are based upon 16 regional groupings of 186 individual pollen assemblages to produce temporal temperature plots (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figures S2 and S3</xref>). Our regional terrestrial climate reconstructions are characterised by a complex pattern of pre-EOT cooling (four regions), cooling across the EOT (two regions and another three possible regions) and regions with no reconstructed change (five regions) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Regions where Mean Annual Temperature Ranges (MATR) remain largely unchanged or do not show a clear cooling trend over the EOT include eastern North America (N2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), North Atlantic region (N3), South America (N11; N13), Africa (N14), southeast Australia (N15) and tropical Asia and India (N16). In north eastern North America (N2), pre-EOT MATR was 17.0–20.8 °C, following the EOT MATR remained 17.0–20.8 °C with one record reconstructing 13.3–14.0 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). The North Atlantic region (N3) was 14.0–16.5 °C until 34.7 Ma when the MATR cooled to 11.6–14.0 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). After 34.7 Ma, MATR remained constant across the EOT until 32–31 Ma when a warming to 14–16.5 °C is reconstructed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). In tropical South America (N11; N13), tropical Africa (N14) and tropical Asia and India (N16) reconstructed MATR throughout the studied time interval was 18.0–27.5 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). However, our method is based on Nearest Living Relatives (NLR) and therefore not able to reconstruct tropical temperatures above modern values. In southeast Australia (N15) Priabonian MATR was 13.4–20.6 °C until ~36 Ma, after which the reconstructed MATR cooled to 11.3–15.5 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). This MATR remained relatively constant until 32–31 Ma when MATR increases to 12.2–20.6 °C (
