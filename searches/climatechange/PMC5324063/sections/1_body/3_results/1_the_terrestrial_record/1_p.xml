<p class="p">For the terrestrial realm, the lack of long and well dated sediment records puts considerable constraints on a detailed spatial and temporal reconstruction of environmental change at the EOT. The terrestrial proxy dataset crossing the EOT is very sparse and evidence seems to be less clear than in the marine records with no consistent pattern of change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The palaeoecological evidence can be divided into three major groups (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) which show either 
 <bold class="bold">(a)</bold> no change across the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, (
 <bold class="bold">b)</bold> a pronounced cooling at the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, often associated with an increase in seasonality and lower winter temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, or (
 <bold class="bold">c)</bold> a gradual change that had already started before the EOT during the middle to late Eocene and continued into the Oligocene

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. Terrestrial oxygen isotopes have shown no change in South America
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>, but a strong cooling in North America and northwest Europe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Mammal faunal turnovers at the EOT are well documented on Eurasia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, but do not seem to have occurred in North America, where tooth mesowear from mammalian herbivores shows long-term change from the Middle Eocene rather than short-term change at the EOT
