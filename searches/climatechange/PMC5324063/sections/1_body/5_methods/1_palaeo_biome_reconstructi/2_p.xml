 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" class="xref">85</xref>. Beside palaeo-coordinates, TEVIS also includes data on the age of the pollen assemblage, sedimentology, method used to date the sample and a quality (Q) indicator to evaluate the dating uncertainties. The Q – indicator applies a qualitative classification to the dating of a pollen assemblage, preservation of the material and original purpose of the publication (palaeoclimate/palaeoenvironmental versus pure biostratigraphical study) where a Q-number of 1 would equal a pollen assemblage with excellent age constraint either through radiometric dating or multiple biostratigraphic frameworks combined with magnetostratigraphy that is well preserved and the original study had a focus on either palaeoenvironments or palaeoclimates; a Q-number of 3 would be a site with one or more biostratigrapical frameworks that are independent of palynology, with moderate to good preservation of the palynomorphs and, whilst the main focus may not have been palaeoenvironmental, some interpretations were made by the original authors and a Q-number of 5 is applied to localities that have been presented with little evidence for how they were dated, or have very poor fossil preservation or contained no information on the palaeoenvironment. 18.6% of the dataset has a quality Q1 or Q2 and only datasets with Q1 to Q4 dating quality were included in this study. Following the methodology of Salzmann 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>, we have translated the Q-numbers into a qualitative confidence ranking (low, medium, high or very high). Pollen assemblages had their taxonomic nomenclature standardised using published synonymies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" class="xref">86</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b87" class="xref">87</xref> and the John Williams Index of Palaeopalynology
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b88" class="xref">88</xref>. To avoid artificial similarity, “form genera” without a species diagnosis were excluded from the dataset, as these often have a wide range of botanical affinity (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">Triporopollenites</italic> sp. could originate from Betulaceae, Myricaceae or Proteaceae). Conversely to increase similarity between the pollen assemblages, taxa with different naming traditions, depending on the age of the work and the school of the original author
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b86" class="xref">86</xref>, were combined under a common pollen name (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> sp. or 
 <italic class="italic">Alnipollenites</italic> sp. as well as named species of these, combined under 
 <italic class="italic">Alnus</italic> – type). The pollen assemblages were then filtered to ensure that no pollen assemblage had dating uncertainty that could place it in more than one geological stage (e.g. no individual pollen assemblage was included in the analysis with an age range that covered the Late Eocene and the Early Oligocene). Then the synonymised pollen assemblage data were entered into PRIMER (Plymouth Routines in Multivariate Ecological Research version 6, PRIMER-E Ltd, Plymouth Marine Laboratory, UK

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b90" class="xref">90</xref>, pre-treated with the presence/absence function and the Jaccard Index Coefficient was applied to generate the resemblance matrix of the pollen assemblages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). The similarity of the pollen assemblages was ordinated as a cluster analysis and similarity profile (SIMPROF) tests were run with 9999 permutations to identify groups of pollen assemblages considered homologous (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). SIMPROF seeks to identify clusters within a hierarchical cluster analysis whereby no further structure (branching) can be identified with increasing similarity
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b91" class="xref">91</xref>. These grouped pollen assemblages were then assigned a palaeo-biome based on the interpretations of the original pollen assemblage’s authors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). In all palaeo-biomes with multiple pollen assemblages the different author’s interpretations did not disagree. The palaeo-biomes were then plotted in ArcGIS 10 using a palaeogeographic map from Markwick
