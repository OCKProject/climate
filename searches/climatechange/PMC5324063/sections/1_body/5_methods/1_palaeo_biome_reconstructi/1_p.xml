<p class="p">We synthesised 397 pollen assemblages from 216 localities with ages covering the Priabonian to the Rupelian into TEVIS
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" class="xref">82</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). In our analysis we only used plant microfossils (pollen and spores) rather than an approach integrating all plant fossil data (such as has been used in refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82" class="xref">82</xref>), due to the statistical grouping applied to the data. Fossil pollen and spore taxa and macrofossil taxa, do not share a common taxonomy and assigning a fossil pollen grain and a fossil leaf to a parent species is a difficult prospect, except in the rare instances that multiple articulated plant parts are preserved together
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83" class="xref">83</xref>. Therefore, if plant macrofossils had been included in the statistical analysis there would have been no shared similarity between the two. Whilst a workaround might have been to assign both micro- and macrofossils to genus or family level bins (e.g. all fossils related to 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> assigned to that genus-level bin), this would have artificially increased the similarity and ignored the biogeography of well documented pollen, spore and macrofossil taxa
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84" class="xref">84</xref>. As research on fossil pollen and spores is far more commonplace (their small size and utilisation for biostratigraphy make them more routinely studied than plant macrofossils), a focus on pollen and spores was determined as the best way of maximising the geographical area covered and producing a large dataset that would enable us address our hypotheses.
