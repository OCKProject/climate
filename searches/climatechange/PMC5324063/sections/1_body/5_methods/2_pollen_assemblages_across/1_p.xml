<p class="p">We utilised eleven sites from the TEVIS dataset with a continuous record covering the EOT to analyse pollen assemblage changes through time. These pollen assemblages are confidently tied to a chronostratigraphy that allows the position of the EOT to be known; number 2, 3, 8 &amp; 11 have a numerical chronology; 6 &amp; 7 have dated horizons at the top and bottom of the records; 1, 4, 5, 9 &amp; 10 do not have a numerical chronology, but the position of the EOT is known (

The Jaccard Similarity Index of each pollen assemblage, relative to the pollen assemblage that was immediately stratigraphically below it was then plotted for each site. The number of pollen taxa in the dataset was also plotted, as a significant increase or decrease in the number of pollen taxa would artificially lower the similarity of successive assemblages.
