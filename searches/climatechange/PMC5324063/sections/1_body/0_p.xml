<p class="p">The Eocene – Oligocene (EOT) transition (ca. 33.9–33.5 Ma) is widely considered to be the biggest step in Cenozoic climate evolution associated with a global cooling, disruption of marine ecosystems and the onset of Antarctic glaciation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. The tectonic opening of the ocean gateways in the Tasmanian Sea and Drake Passage establishing the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and thermal isolation of Antarctica have long been proposed as the major driver for global climate change at the EOT

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. However, geological evidence from marine proxies and climate model studies have challenged this hypothesis of a southern hemisphere driven, tectonically controlled global climate change on the grounds of a potential time lag between the onset of the ACC and palaeogeographic changes
