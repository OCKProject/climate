<p class="p">We minimized the potential uncertainty of using NLR to reconstruct biomes by applying a statistical approach to produce palaeo-biomes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This method used presence/absence data rather than abundance of individual pollen taxa. By focussing on presence/absence data we removed any noise in our reconstructions from habitat variation, landscape changes, shifts in depositional environment or the differences between palynologistâ€™s counting techniques
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>. Our approach is specifically designed to identify large changes in biome distribution primarily driven by climate changes and accompanied by distinct changes in taxa composition. However, for this reason our approach cannot detect smaller scale relative changes in abundance, which may explain some differences in our global scale reconstruction when compared to individual studies that found change at the EOT from fluctuations in the proportion of different pollen types
