<p class="p">Our study questions previous notions of a uniform, abrupt change of terrestrial vegetation and climate at the EOT and a rapid shift from a greenhouse to an icehouse world. The growth of an Antarctic ice sheet through the late Eocene

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. It has been shown that terrestrial sites proximal to the oceans have strong hydrological connections at the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>, which may mean these were sensitive to changes in ocean currents or sea level fall that were the result of the formation of the Antarctic ice sheet. A strong link between near-coastal and the marine realm explains why one of the regions where we identify an EOT cooling was around the Gulf Coast of North America (

Further work is required to fully understand the late Eocene evolution of the earth system that created the conditions necessary to cause substantial growth of the Antarctic ice sheet at the EOT, without causing significant change in global vegetation in unison with the oxygen isotope excursion.
