<p class="p">Much of our prior knowledge of vegetation at the EOT comes from macrofossil syntheses in North America that proposed equatorward shifts in palaeo-biomes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>. Reanalysis of these macrofossil sites has, however, revealed a more gradual cooling through the late Eocene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. Other regional reviews of the palaeobotanical evidence have demonstrated that the terrestrial record shows a high degree of heterogeneity in climate and vegetation before, during and after the EOT

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>. This is in agreement with our global reconstruction based on palynological data and suggests that the terrestrial realm may have undergone a long-term transitional interval that began at the end of the middle Eocene. However, terrestrial oxygen isotopes from North America and northwest Europe have reconstructed MAT decreases of ≤8 °C at the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>, which is not in agreement with our palynological results. However, the interpretation of these records is subject to controversy. Further work in North America found no change in MAT but a shift in precipitation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>, whilst those from northwest Europe may represent a change in the growing season temperature and hydrological source
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. The heterogeneity in the timing and scale of change in the vegetation record through the late Eocene–early Oligocene reported here and by others complicates the idea that mammalian turnovers in Europe and Asia were a direct result of vegetation change promoted by EOT cooling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The Mongolian Re-modelling (MR) in Asia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref> and the Grande Coupure (GC) in Europe are dated to around the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. The MR is related to increased aridity in central Asia
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref>, a result consistent with our palaeo-biome reconstructions showing an increase in xerophytic shrubland in central Asia during the Rupelian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The GC is associated with a shift to more seasonal vegetation types and the biogeographical spread of Asian mammalian lineages
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. Our reconstructions show some spread of more seasonal palaeo-biomes around the Mediterranean, but not in more northern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Elsewhere in the world, the fossil mammal record shows faunal changes at the end of the middle Eocene and sometimes no response to the EOT

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>. Overall the terrestrial realm shows a pronounced longer-term development from the end of the middle Eocene to the early Oligocene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>, this is particularly well demonstrated through our synthesis of global palynological records and requires a more complex mechanism than a rapid and large drawdown of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at the EOT to explain this global heterogeneity.
