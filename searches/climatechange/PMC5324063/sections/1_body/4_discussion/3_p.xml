<p class="p">In the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere our main palaeo-biome changes between the Priabonian and the Rupelian are associated with the distribution arid biomes in southwest Europe and Central to east Asia (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. Aridity in central Asia has been present since the early Eocene and is likely the result of tectonic uplift

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>, this has likely been present since the late Eocene as isotopic evidence from Spain shows no change through the late Eocene and early Oligocene
