<p class="p">Our data synthesis provides no evidence for a global-scale uniform terrestrial response to a rapid cooling at the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Instead our global palaeo-biome distributions and terrestrial temperature reconstructions point to a more complex pattern of pre-EOT change, isolated changes at the EOT and regions with no change. Our quality assessment indicates that many localities in the high-latitudes of the northern hemisphere showing palaeo-biome changes at the EOT are associated with low-confidence levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In the North Atlantic, several very high-confidence sites with temperate conifer forest are present in both the Priabonian and the Rupelian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) indicating no change, whereas only a single low-confidence paratropical/subtropical forest record in the Priabonian indicates a climatic change at the EOT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This record comes from DSDP 338 and has low-resolution dating based on palynomorph biostratigraphy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. Whereas at the very high-confidence site of ODP 913B, the Jaccard similarity shows a change in vegetation before the EOT at 36–35 Ma (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) resulting from the loss of pollen from thermophilic plants

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. At the high-latitudes of North America one low-confidence locality suggests a 5° southward shift of warm-temperate mixed forest by the Rupelian (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This is based upon a single sample and whilst this may indicate an EOT induced shift in high-latitude vegetation the confidence level is very low due to the poor age control
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>. The change from warm-temperate to paratropical/subtropical forest in Siberia is documented by medium-confidence localities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) These have excellent pollen preservation, but the dating resolution only assigns each locality to a geological stage without greater refinement
