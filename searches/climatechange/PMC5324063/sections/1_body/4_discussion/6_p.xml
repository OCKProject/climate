<p class="p">Insufficient age control and the lack of modern analogue vegetation are inherent to most deep-time geological studies and also put limitations on our approach that need to be considered before further discussing the wider implications of our findings. The low temporal resolution of our records may prevent the identification of a hypothesised “transitional” EOT with a short-term cooling and a subsequent return to near pre-EOT levels

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. However, neither the regional temperature reconstructions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) nor the 11 sediment records of our dataset which have sufficient age control and resolution to identify short term change at the EOT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), support the hypothesis a “transitional” EOT.
