<p class="p">Whilst our palaeo-biome and MAT reconstructions show no uniform global change across the EOT, there is a wealth of evidence for a marine realm disruption
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Some of these could be related to the impacts of a large sea-level fall on shallow marine ecosystems
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, which is also reflected in the reduction of mangrove palm diversity in Africa during the Rupelian
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref>. The Eocene - Oligocene appears to have seen a global scale reorganization of oceanic currents
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69" class="xref">69</xref>. Numerous geochemical proxies have recorded a global cooling of surface and deep waters across the EOT which was most pronounced at the high latitudes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Recent evidence from the North Atlantic indicates that bottom water formation could have begun during the middle Eocene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70" class="xref">70</xref> and northern component water entered the South Atlantic before the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71" class="xref">71</xref>. Tropical Pacific records show significant inputs of reworked material with erosional hiatuses during the EOT
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72" class="xref">72</xref> and deep sea gastropod diversification increases in response to more nutrients entering the deep sea at this time
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73" class="xref">73</xref>. Diatoms show their first global diversity peak
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74" class="xref">74</xref> during the EOT, possibly in response to large surface water productivity changes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" class="xref">75</xref> and an acceleration of the phosphorous cycle due to alterations in ocean circulation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" class="xref">76</xref>. This interval of changing oceanic currents is supported by model simulations that show an early Oligocene Antarctic ice sheet would have drastically altered Southern Ocean flow
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" class="xref">77</xref> and that deep ocean cooling can be achieved through ocean gateway changes without changing atmospheric pCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. The deep ocean oxygen isotope signal may therefore not necessarily reflect global surface temperature changes at the EOT
