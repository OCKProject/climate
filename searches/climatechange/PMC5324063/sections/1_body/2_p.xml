<p class="p">The discussion about forcing and timing of climate change at the EOT is primarily based on evidence from model simulations and geochemical proxies derived from marine sediment cores. Some terrestrial oxygen isotope records appear to support the marine evidence by showing up to 8 °C lower mean annual temperatures (MAT) in the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere after the EOT
