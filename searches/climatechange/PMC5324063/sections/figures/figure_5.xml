  <title class="title">Regional composite (multi-site) Mean Annual Temperature Ranges (MATR) for 16 regions from the beginning of the Priabonian, across the EOT and through the Rupelian.</title>
  <p class="p">The horizontal bars show the MATR based on the co-existence approach. Vertical bars present the uncertainty ranges for the dating of each pollen assemblage. Colour-shaded areas show the trend in the MATR. Grey bars show the accepted temporal range of the EOT (33.9–33.5 Ma). The MATR has been reconstructed using the co-existence approach, which reconstructs a range of equally possible temperatures within which a fossil floral assemblage could have co-existed
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b93" class="xref">93</xref> Where a range is narrow there is more confidence in the interpretation of climatic change, whereas a wide range provides lower confidence in our palaeoclimatic interpretations. Map generated in ArcMap 10.4.1.
