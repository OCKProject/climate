  <p class="p">The Jaccard Similarity (blue line) is a measure of similarity between a pollen assemblage and the assemblage that is immediately stratigraphically below it. The number of named pollen taxa (red line) provides a simple means to determine if taphonomic processes (preservation/identification of palynomorphs) might have influenced the similarity of pollen assemblages. Some locations have numerical chronologies, whilst others are dated to geological stages (full details of dating techniques applied at each site are presented in
