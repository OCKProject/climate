<p class="p">Young workers appear to be relatively at higher risk of heat-related injuries in the workplace [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>], however they may be underrepresented due to the aging workforce. Moreover, young workers were usually less inclined to participate in surveys due to various reasons. Therefore, apprentices at local TAFE (Technical and Further Education) colleges were also recruited to represent young workers, a large proportion of whom undertook their studies part time while working as apprentices. In total, 840 TAFE trainees and apprentices enrolled in the courses likely to lead to outdoor work in the “agriculture, forestry and fishing”, “construction”, “electricity, gas and water”, “manufacturing”, and “mining” industries were invited to participate in the survey. After initial contact and meeting with the TAFE College management team and relevant lecturers, questionnaires were distributed by the course lecturers.
