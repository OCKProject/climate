<p class="p">This study provides important insights and baseline information regarding workers’ perceptions and attitudes towards workplace heat exposure. Workers in South Australia were moderately concerned about heat exposure. Further heat educational programmes and training should focus on those undertaking physically demanding work outdoors, in particular young workers and those over 55 years with low education level. The high proportion of respondents unsatisfied with current heat prevention measures and supporting more heat-related regulations indicates the necessity to refine current workplace heat prevention policies in a warming climate. In addition, there is a need to develop local specific and clear enforceable heat regulations.</p>
