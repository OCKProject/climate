<p class="p">About 56.3 % of respondents replied that there was a need for more heat-related training for workers to reduce the risk of heat stress (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, workers aged 25–54 years showed more supportive attitudes towards heat-related trainings than younger (≤24 years) and older workers (≥55 years). In addition, workers with previous history of heat illness (OR = 1.58, 95 % 1.07-2.58) and injury during hot weather (OR = 1.44, 95 % 1.09-1.91) were more interested in heat-related trainings.
