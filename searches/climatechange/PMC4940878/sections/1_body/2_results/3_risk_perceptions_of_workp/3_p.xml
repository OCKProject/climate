<p class="p">Results showed that 63.8 % of respondents agreed that there should be more heat-related regulations and guidelines for working during very hot weather (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Regarding the reasons why the remaining 36.2 % held the opposite view, answers from a subsequent question (Question 20, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>) suggested that over half (52.3 %) thought “there are enough heat regulations”, while 21.5 % considered workplace heat exposure to not be a serious problem. Multiple logistic regression analyses suggested that very physically demanding work (OR = 2.38, 95 % CI 1.21-4.66) and heat illness experience (OR = 1.39, 95 % CI 1.05-1.83) were the two factors associated with workers’ attitudes toward more heat-related policy support (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
