<p class="p">Overall, 51.2 % of respondents were moderately or very much concerned about the risk of heat illness at work during very hot weather (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Results of stepwise logistic regression analyses indicated that workplace heat concern levels increased with the increasing age. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, workers in the three age groups (25–34, 35–54, and ≥55 years) were respectively 1.82 (95 % CI 1.18-2.80), 2.73 (95%CI 1.45-5.12), and 2.77 (95 % CI 1.73-4.43) times more concerned about heat stress than those aged ≤24 years. Other factors significantly associated with workers’ heat stress concerns include undertaking heavily physically demanding work (OR = 2.77, 95 % CI 1.73-4.43), wearing PPE (OR = 1.47, 95 % CI 1.13-1.91), having a history of heat illness (OR = 1.57, 95 % CI 1.01-2.45) and having experienced an injury during hot weather (OR = 2.05, 95 % CI 1.47-2.86).
