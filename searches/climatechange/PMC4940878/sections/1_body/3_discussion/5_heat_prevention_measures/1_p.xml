<p class="p">In this study about one-quarter of respondents claimed to have witnessed heat-related illnesses or injuries during extremely hot weather. This may indirectly reflect the high incidence of occupational heat illnesses despite only 306 heat-related compensation claims being identified in South Australia during the period of 2001â€“2010 with an incidence rate of 4.5 per 100 000 employees [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Fortunately, all heat-related illnesses, injuries and deaths are largely preventable. Heat prevention strategies mainly include regulations, administrative controls, and engineering modifications. Currently, there are systematic technical guidelines and manuals in place for heat stress monitoring, risk assessment, control and prevention, such as ISO (International Organization for Standardization) heat indices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>], ACGIH (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] and NIOSH (US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) heat standards [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Based on above heat standards, the Australian Institute of Occupational Hygienists (AIOH) has developed a heat stress management guideline for use in the Australian environment [
