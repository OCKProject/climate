<p class="p">There are several limitations in this study. First, the vast majority (96 %) of respondents were males. Caution should be used when generalizing the results to female workers. Moreover, as the participation of the survey was completely voluntary, those with previous heat illness and injury experience may have been more likely to participate in the survey, which may generate potential selection bias and therefore may overestimate workers’ heat concerns. Second, the level of workers’ heat-related knowledge was not specifically measured in this study. However, published papers have consistently found that most workers in both developing and developed countries have a good knowledge of heat illnesses [

Although there is not necessarily a relationship between response rates and bias, non-response bias may occur if respondents significantly differ from non-respondents [

Fourth, 68.2 % of participants were TAFE trainees rather than established workers, although the majority worked as apprentices on a part-time basis. Lastly, the survey was not conducted during the hottest part of the year, posing the opportunity for recall bias.
