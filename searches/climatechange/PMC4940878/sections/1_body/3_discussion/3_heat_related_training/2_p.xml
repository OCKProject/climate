<p class="p">The results indicated that heat training was the workers’ major source of information about heat stress prevention in Australia, and this is the case for occupational health and safety in general [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] and South Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] had a good knowledge of the symptoms and severe outcomes of excessive heat exposure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. Although workers’ average level of knowledge on heat stress wasn’t investigated in this study, 16 % of respondents said they only drank when they were thirsty. This indirectly reflects the necessity to reinforce messages about dehydration in the workplace. Relevant training and education should focus on young workers and those aged over 55 years, as these groups expressed less willingness to receive more heat training. Moreover, studies have shown they are at relatively higher risk of heat-related illness and injury [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. More supportive attitudes towards heat-related training in the age group of 25–54 years may account for their greater concerns over heat exposure. The reasons why workers aged ≥55 years did not show stronger willingness to support more heat-related training whilst being more concerned about heat compared to young workers, may include that they may be more satisfied with current preventive measures in place or they may undertake more sedentary jobs with less heat exposure. In addition to training in the workplace, the role of mass media in popularizing heat stress prevention knowledge should be strengthened, as up to 10 % of respondents in this study claimed to have had no sources of heat prevention information.
