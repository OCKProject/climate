<p class="p">Our results suggest that young workers were less concerned about heat exposure than older workers. Moreover, middle aged workers supported having more heat-related training compared to young and older workers. There are many concerns about Australian young workers’ attitudes towards occupational health and safety, of which heat stress is only one. According to the national “Motivations, Attitudes, Perceptions and Skills” survey, up to 28 % of Australian young workers reported resenting dealing with workplace health and safety requirements, and 42 % forgot about safety during working practice [

Further research is also needed to explore the paradoxical phenomena that young workers were less satisfied with heat prevention measures but expressed more negative attitudes towards heat prevention efforts, compared with older workers. Probably, it is because young workers were relatively more powerless than older workers in the workplace and held negative attitudes towards their management [
