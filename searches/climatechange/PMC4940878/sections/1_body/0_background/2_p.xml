<p class="p">Evidence shows that Australia would be at moderate to high risk of occupational heat strain for outdoor workers if temperatures increase by 3 °C [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], raising increased concerns over workplace heat exposure. The potential heat-related impact of climate change on workplaces may be even worse in South Australia (SA) than the Australian national average level, as the average maximum temperature has increased at a faster rate than the national average since 1950 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Adelaide, the capital of SA, has a Mediterranean climate, characterised with very limited rainfall during hot dry summers and maximum temperatures reaching as high as 46.1 °C. According to weather projections for Adelaide, the average number of days with temperatures over 35 °C will triple by 2070 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Some studies in Adelaide have found that heat stress levels were high in some occupations (e.g., miners, shearers, and road maintenance workers) [
