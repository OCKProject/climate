<p class="p">In this study, we consider 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> as a potential invasive species for all South American river basins since its barrier to dispersal has been broken by human activities, especially through fish farming in net cages [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Relying on correlations between climate and species occurrences our study simultaneously assesses the effects of climate change on the native distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> and on its invasiveness across river basins of South America, using an ecological niche modeling approach. First, we estimated the range expansion of the species through climatically suitable areas of the continent at the present time. Then, we assessed the effects of climate change projected for 2050 and 2080 on the geographical distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in native and invaded regions. Finally, we identified climate refugia in the native region, corresponding to strategic areas for implementing species conservation measures, as well as in the invaded regions, corresponding to areas in which native fish fauna should experience the negative effects of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> invasion in the face of climate change. In addition to conservation issues, we also addressed considerations on socio-economic issues due to the effect of climate change on distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic>. The model predictions indicated that favorable climatic conditions, abundant at the present time, would become scarce in the future, implying conservation and socio-economic concerns in the native region. Although the invasive potential of this species is predicted to decrease in the face of climate change, climate refugia will remain in the Paran√° River, the East Atlantic basins and the Southeast Atlantic basins, putting intense, negative pressures on native fish fauna.
