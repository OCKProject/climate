<p class="p">In South American basins, introduced fish species, both from South America itself (allochthonous invaders) and from other continents, are commonly used in fish farming. Many of these fish species have become invasive, and some are starting to colonize non-native areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Because there is no fully safe confinement in aquaculture, the flow of non-native propagules into different drainage basins is expected to be constant and intensive [

The widespread release and dispersion of non-native fish through climatically suitable areas into South American rivers are major concerns from a conservation viewpoint. Furthermore, global warming may expand the geographic areas with suitable temperatures for aquaculture, boosting the impacts of invasive species [
