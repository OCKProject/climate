 <italic class="italic">Colossoma macropomum</italic> Cuvier 1818, popularly known as tambaqui, is a native fish species from the Amazon and Orinoco River basins in northern South America [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Due to its large body size and highly appreciated meat for human consumption, tambaqui is among the most cultivated Neotropical fish species in fish farms [

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> is not systematically monitored, the frequency of such events is high in the face of its continuous and intensive farm production. To date, there is no record of

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> having formed large non-native populations, and their potential impacts are still not precisely known [

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> populations in non-native regions, increasing the probability of establishment in different South American river basins, potentially affecting the native fish fauna of such areas.
