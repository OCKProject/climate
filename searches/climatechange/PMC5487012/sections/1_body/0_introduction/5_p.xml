<p class="p">Additionally, climate change has complex effects on the potential distribution of freshwater fish, mainly by altering the environmental conditions where species find the bulk of requirements needed to complete their life cycle in the present-day. The multiple responses to climate change have involved the shift, expansion and contraction of geographical ranges. However, most of the evidences is geographically and taxonomically biased towards the temperate regions and salmonids, respectively [

Therefore, the scientific debate is restricted to a limited level in the face of worldwide extraordinarily high freshwater fish diversity worldwide. The gap in knowledge is still more critical when considering the responses of introduced species to climate change, with a scarcity of studies in tropical regions.
