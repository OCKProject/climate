 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in the future with consecutive range contraction is not a concern only for the speciesâ€™ conservation but also from a socio-economic point of view. It is expected that habitat unsuitability will decrease the intrinsic rate of population growth, leading to extinction scenarios over time, thus jeopardizing the species conservation. In addition, the population decline of the species in the native basins tends to cause strong damages to the economy due to its importance in the regional fishery (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]). This species has been exploited commercially in the Amazon Basin since at least the end of the nineteenth century, becoming the main species of fishery landings (see [
