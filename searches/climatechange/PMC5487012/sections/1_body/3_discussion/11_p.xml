 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in the Amazon and Orinoco River basins are a clear sign that actions for the conservation of the species are urgent. Thus, the maintenance of the original characteristics of climate refugia in the Amazon is crucial. In addition, an important step towards more effective conservation measures would be combining, with our findings, the results for other species in order to identify sub-regions in these watersheds that maximize species occupancy under future climate conditions, and then make them protected areas. It is also noteworthy that the purposes of the National Energy Expansion Plan reveal the intention of the Brazilian government to implement major hydroelectric projects in the Amazon [

The creation of basic specific criteria for the development of fish farming activities using native species, and the acquisition of specific information on the impacts of non-native species, are critical for the success of management measures in the future.
