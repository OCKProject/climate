<p class="p">In addition to the massive fish-culture in reservoirs, non-native species have been largely cultivated for either sale or recreational fishing in tanks excavated near the margin of water bodies, especially in densely populated areas [

Among the biological invasion hypotheses, the human activity hypothesis predicts that antropogenically altered ecosystems (here represented by highly populated river basins) or ecosystems with high propagule pressure (here represented by the water bodies supplying fish farms) make colonization and establishment easier for non-native species [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Thus, a positive relationship is expected between non-native species and variables linked to habitat alteration and propagule pressure [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Therefore, the human activity hypothesis can be used for the explanation of the invasion process of
