<p class="p">Farming non-native species is a potential cause of biological invasion, and therefore constitutes a significant threat to freshwater biodiversity. Our study suggests that managers and decision makers must carefully define more appropriate long-term strategies for conservation of freshwater biodiversity. These strategies should include preventive management actions and conservation policies that are specifically designed based on the biogeography of species and environmental characteristics of each river basin.</p>
