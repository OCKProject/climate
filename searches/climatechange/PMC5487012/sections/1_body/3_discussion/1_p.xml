<p class="p">It is agreed that climate change and species invasions independently cause serious ecological damage. Given that these two continuous phenomena are expected to interact in nature, we assessed the effects of environmental change drivers on the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in both native and non-native ranges, contributing to bridging the gap of knowledge on the responses of tropical fish species. We show that potential conservation conflicts in the native region are expected as a result of climate change due to extraordinarily large losses of suitable areas. In addition, we call attention to the need for effective strategies against the invasion of this species in climate refugia outside the native region.
