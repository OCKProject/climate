<p class="p">By projecting the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> for the years 2050 and 2080, under a low-moderate scenario, we observed that the species tends to drastically reduce its geographical distribution in the native region. In general, studies support the idea that the range contraction phenomenon is a response of cold-water fish species to climate change, whereas warm-water species tend to expand their ranges (see [
