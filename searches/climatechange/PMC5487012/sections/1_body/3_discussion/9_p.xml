Habitat suitability may lead to an increase in the population abundance at exceptional levels in the climate refuge regions. Thus, besides having address with restrictions imposed by climate change, the native fauna of such regions should also suffer with the intensification of impacts provided by the invasion of

Although the competition pressure of these allochthonous invaders might not be severe, omnivorous fish may have as much impact as predator species in native assemblages, as these species are capable of changing environmental quality and nutrient cycling, thus imposing impacts at the ecosystem level [
