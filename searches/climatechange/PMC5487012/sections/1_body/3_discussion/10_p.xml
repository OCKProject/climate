<p class="p">Common terminology used for invasive species (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]) has led to the feeling that only organisms relocated from great distances (e.g., other continents) can be considered as invaders [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This has led to the common belief that species translocated from the same country, such as

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic>, do not cause negative impacts on ecosystems. Thus, a great part of the efforts of scientific research, mitigative measures and public policy does not consider native South American species as invaders in different basins within the continent. This is a misconception, since the introduction of any species outside their natural habitat can cause major disturbances in the native communities [

 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Thus, there is a scientific challenge in making explicit the risks of cultivation of wrongly considered native species explicit.
