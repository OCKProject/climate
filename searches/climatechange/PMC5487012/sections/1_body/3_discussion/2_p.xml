<p class="p">Our results indicate low climatic suitability in stretches of the original basins, corresponding to the Venezuelan Amazon and upper Orinoco river regions. Previous studies suggest that a spatially irregular or low sampling effort can bias the distribution modeling results, in particular for sub-regions of the geographic space [
