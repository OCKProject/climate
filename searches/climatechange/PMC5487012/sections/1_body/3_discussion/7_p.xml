 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. However, some studies have shown that climate change can reduce invasion risks, especially in lower-latitude regions, which is consistent with our results. In South Africa, 30 invasive grass species should experience the loss of approximately 50% of their potential range by mid-century [
