<p class="p">By simulating the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> throughout South American basins, we showed that large areas are suitable for the species outside its native basins, especially in the North Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Tocantins-Araguaia and Paraná-Paraguay basins. Boosted by stocking and fish farming activities, this species has been successfully in occupying such areas. Since the first half of the twentieth century, stocking activities have been conducted in Northeast Brazil, aiming to increase the region’s fishery production [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Such practice was expanded to other non-native basins, and stocking programs were carried out by the Brazilian hydroelectric sector through legal constraints imposed by the organizations of fishery development. The first Fishery Code of Brazil (Decree-Law N° 794 from 19/10/1938), which made fish farming compulsory in reservoirs, is an example of such development policy [
