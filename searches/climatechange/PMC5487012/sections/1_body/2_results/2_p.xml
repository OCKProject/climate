<p class="p">The first two PCA axes represented a large proportion of variation between suitability maps generated by different ENMs. The accumulated proportion of variation represented by the two axes ranged from 69% to 84% in native region in 2080 and South America at the present time, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179684.g002" class="xref">Fig 2G</xref>). In the future, the predictions of CONS were more similar to those of EUCD (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179684.g002" class="xref">Fig 2H and 2I</xref>). In general, MAXE produced results markedly different from the other methods. The CONS model had the highest loadings for the first PCA axis for different times and data sets (
