 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179684.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>). Amazonian Rivers, especially those located in the southern portion (from southwestern to southeastern), hold the most suitable environmental conditions in the native region. When the model is extended to South America, a large portion of climatically suitable areas (CSAs) were identified outside the original basins, mainly in the North Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Tocantins-Araguaia and Paraná-Paraguay (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179684.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B</xref>). The species distribution in the native region was estimated to be 1,668 cells, corresponding to approximately 68.67% of the original basins (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179684.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). By transposing geographical barriers, it is expected that this species will expand its range by 999 cells (corresponding to approximately 59.9% of their native range), occupying approximately 24.6% of the invaded region. Our results show that the invasive potential of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> is greatly amplified when the locations of fish farms rearing the species are included in the modelling process. Because the regular introduction of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in contiguous aquatic bodies is just a matter of time, fish farming activity tends to exceptionally magnify the species invasion in the São Francisco (355.6%), East Atlantic (261.5%) and Southeast Atlantic (263.0%) basins. In general, the invasion potential of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> expands to 1,318 cells (approximately 32.5% of invaded region) when we consider the natural environment and fish farming occurrences together in the modeling process (
