This search was still supplemented with an extensive review in ISI (

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in non-native regions of the South America mostly originated from stocking and fish farming. Regarding the latter, fish farms are continuously putting juveniles and adults of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> into the natural environments of non-native areas mainly due to: i) the escape of individuals along with the effluent water; ii) their confinement breaking by natural flooding and iii) the inappropriate management of tanks. Thus, fish farming constitutes the main vector of

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> introduction in South America. Based on the assumptions that there is no fully safe confinement and that fish farms act as constant and effective propagule sources for the cultivated species [
