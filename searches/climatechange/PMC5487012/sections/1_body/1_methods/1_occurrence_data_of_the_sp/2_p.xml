<p class="p">The occurrence records from both the natural environment and fish farms were mapped on a regular geographical grid, containing 6,180 cells with spatial resolutions of latitude and longitude of 0.5Â°, representing the 14 major river basins of South America. The area of each cell grid corresponds to approximately 3025 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (55 x 55 km). The mapping of the occurrence records on the geographical grid resulted in 178 occupied cells. Thus, two binary matrices of presence and pseudo-absence were constructed: (1) South America considering occurrences from natural environments (104 occupied cells) and (2) South America considering occurrences from natural environment and fish farming together (178 occupied cells) (see
