<p class="p">Forecasts of future bioclimatic variables (projected for 2050 and 2080) were extracted from the model by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC-AR5) (

We used four Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs): CCSM (Community Climate System Model), CSIRO (Australia’s Common wealth Scientific and Industrial Research’s General Organization), MIROC (Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) and MRI (Meteorological Research Institute). The concentration trajectory for each AOGCMs was based on the Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 (RPC 4.5; moderate scenario of carbon emission within the optimistic context). We assumed the ALT, NR and UFL were temporally stationary to perform future predictions.
