<p class="p">We used four bioclimatic variables related to the environmental tolerance of the species as predictors of the species distribution: maximum temperature of the warmest month (
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C; TMAX), minimum temperature of coldest month (
 <sup class="sup">o</sup>C; TMIN), precipitation of the wettest month (mm; PMAX) and precipitation of the driest month (mm; PMIN) [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Temperature and precipitation are the major climatic parameters determining the distribution of organisms on Earth. The former is responsible for altering the metabolism (especially the enzymatic activity) of living organisms, and the latter determines the seasonal variations of droughts and floods, synchronizing biological events of the species, such as migration, spawning, home range and growth. We also used two hydrological variables as measures of water availability in each grid cell: the number of rivers (NR) and the upstream flow length (m; UFL, corresponding to distance from the headwater sources) (

In addition to bioclimatic and hydrological variables, we also used mean altitude (m; ALT) as a predictor variable to address distribution restrictions imposed by the Andes, Neblina Peak and Venezuelan Mountains in Northern Amazon and Serra do Mar Mountains in eastern Brazil [
