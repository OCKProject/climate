 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]), Mahalanobis distance (MAHD; [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]), Ecological Niche Factor Analysis (ENFA; [

 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]). Predictions vary among ENMs because of the different assumptions of each model. Because all models are biologically plausible, we treated the variation among predictions as statistical uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. To account for the statistical uncertainty and minimize inferential errors, we employed the 
 <italic class="italic">ensemble forecasting</italic> approach, which consists of calculating the “consensus” of multiple models (CONS, [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]). Assuming that distinct sources of errors affect each ENM in different ways, by obtaining a consensus model, the errors in each individual prediction tend to cancel each other out, therefore producing a more reliable prediction [
