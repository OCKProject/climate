<p class="p">Considering that broad scale patterns of species occurrence are determined by the responses of organisms to different environmental conditions (reflecting the Grinellian component of the ecological niche,

The two species occurrence matrices (South America considering occurrences in natural environments, and South America considering occurrences in natural and fish farming environments) were modeled with ENMs, using the layers of climatic-environmental variables. The fit of ENMs yield suitability matrices, from which the potential distribution of
