<p class="p">For each ENM, the extent of species occurrence was randomly divided into two subsets: 75% for calibration and 25% for evaluation. This procedure was repeated 50 times to avoid bias in the calibration and evaluation of the data sets. We converted the continuous predictions of suitability of each ENM into binary vectors of presences and absences in each cell (1/0) using the threshold that maximizes sensitivity and specificity values in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The ROC curve is generated by plotting the fraction of true positives versus the fraction of false positives at various threshold settings. The distribution of

 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in current climatic conditions was estimated using 300 predictions (6 ENMs x 50 randomizations) for each species occurrence matrix. The simulations for future climatic conditions were estimated obtaining 1200 predictions (6 ENMs x 50 randomizations x 4 GCMs) for each future time (2050 and 2080) and for each specie occurrence matrix. This procedure allowed us to generate a frequency of projections in the ensemble. We then generated the frequency of projections weighted by the TSS statistics for each region and time, i.e., better models have more weight in our consensus projections. The TSS range from -1 to +1, where values equal to +1 are a perfect prediction and values equal to or less than zero are a prediction no better than random [
