<p class="p">From the presence and absence outputs provided by ENMs reflecting the main direction of variation of the suitability data, we estimated the native range of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> and its expansion across climatically suitable areas of South America. We generated an occupancy matrix for the 14 major South American basins: the Amazon and Orinoco basins representing the native region, and the Pacific, Magdalena, North Atlantic, Northeast Atlantic, Eastern Atlantic, Tocantins-Araguaia, São Francisco, Paraná-Paraguay, Uruguay, Southeast Atlantic, Lake Titicaca and Colorado-Patagonian basins representing the non-native regions. Then, we computed the total number of occupied cells in native and non-native basins at the present time. We analyzed the effects of climate change on native distribution and the non-native regions by assessing the range shift, expansion and contraction phenomena, and performed the same protocol for the two future times. We also performed such analysis considering the natural environmental and fish farming occurrences together, to portray a more pessimistic scenario with respect to the invasion of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> into South America river basins. Then, we identified the basins in which the invasive process should be amplified by fish-farm activity over time. In addition, we finally identified the areas of South America serving as climate refugia for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> in 2050 and 2080. Climate refugia in the native region correspond to the areas of greatest interest for the conservation of the species and in the non-native regions correspond to the areas in which the native fish fauna has the most potential to experience the impacts of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> invasion in the face of climate change.
