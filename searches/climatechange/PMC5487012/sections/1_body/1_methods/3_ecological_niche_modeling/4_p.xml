<p class="p">Principal components analysis (PCA) [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] was used to compare the suitability outputs derived from alternative ENMs and their consensus at current and future times. This analysis allowed us to: i) evaluate the degree to which different ENMs converge in estimates of the climatic suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic>; and ii) determine which model reflects the main direction of variation among the suitability maps [
 <xref rid="pone.0179684.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. In our study, only the results of models reflecting the main direction of variation among the suitability maps were interpreted. The suitability of native region was obtained from results generated for 2.429 cells of South America, representing the Amazon and Orinoco basins. Given that in native basins the escapes of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macropomum</italic> from fish farms do not generate impact, the analyses covering the native region were focused only on natural occurrences, disregarding fish farms.
