<p id="Par55" class="p">We scored the variables of the three elements of vulnerability on an ordinal scale using two scoring schemes: unweighted and weighted (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In the unweighted scoring scheme, we considered the variables within each element as equally important and were awarded a maximum score of three points and a minimum score of one point following Gardali, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. In the weighted scheme, the variables within each element were ranked according to their perceived relative contribution to vulnerability as deemed by a panel of experts
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. Higher maximum scores were awarded to the variables that contributed more to climate vulnerability, with categories within variables awarded a minimum score of one and a median score of half the maximum score following Cabrelli, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. For example, of the 11 sensitivity traits used in this study, thermal tolerance was regarded the most important trait and so it was awarded the highest maximum score of 11 for species with narrow thermal tolerance, a score of 5.5 for species with moderate tolerance, and a score of one for species with wide tolerance. Life span was regarded the least important of the traits and was therefore awarded the lowest maximum score of three for short-lived species, a score of two for species with moderate life-spans, and a score of one for long-lived species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
