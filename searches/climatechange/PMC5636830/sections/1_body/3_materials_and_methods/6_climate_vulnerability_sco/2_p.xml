<p id="Par58" class="p">In the first classification, vulnerability categorization based on the raw continuous values produced similar results as categorization based on ranked values for exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The second classification however required that we first rank the species as either high, moderate or low exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity before determining their vulnerability status. We evaluated the relationship between the two assessment methods (i.e., with and without considering adaptive capacity) and scoring schemes (i.e., unweighted and weighted) using the Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient and analysed the difference between them using the Fisher’s exact test.</p>
