<p id="Par57" class="p">To generate a climate change vulnerability score, we first divided the sum of the scores for each of the three elements of vulnerability by their respective potential maximum score to generate exposure score (
 <italic class="italic">Es</italic>), sensitivity score (
 <italic class="italic">Ss</italic>) and adaptive capacity score (
 <italic class="italic">As</italic>). We then computed vulnerability score with adaptive capacity (ESA) as (
 <italic class="italic">Es</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Ss</italic>) − 
 <italic class="italic">As</italic> and without adaptive capacity (ES) as 
 <italic class="italic">Es</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Ss</italic>. Computing ESA as (
 <italic class="italic">Es</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">Ss</italic>)/
 <italic class="italic">As</italic> did not change the outcome of the vulnerability rankings. We applied two of the commonly used vulnerability ranking thresholds. Firstly, following Cabrelli, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, species with ESA/ES ≥67 were ranked as high vulnerability, those with ESA/ES from 33 to 66 were ranked as moderate vulnerability and those with ESA/ES &lt; 33 were classified as low vulnerability. Secondly, following Dawson, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup> and Foden, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>, we assigned species to four vulnerability categories: high, potential adapters, potential persisters and high latent risk. High vulnerability species are those that have high sensitivity, high exposure and low adaptive capacity to climate change. Potential adapters are the species that are highly exposed and sensitive to climate change, but have high capacity to adapt and tolerate the impacts of the change (Dawson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011; Foden 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2013). Potential persisters are species that are highly exposed and have low adaptive capacity, but are not sensitive to climate change, while species with high latent risk are those with low exposure, but high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity to climate change (Dawson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011; Foden 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2013).
