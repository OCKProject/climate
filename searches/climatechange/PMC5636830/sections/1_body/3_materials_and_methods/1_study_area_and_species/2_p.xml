<p id="Par31" class="p">To demonstrate the generality and transferability of our framework, we selected lizards with a broad spectrum of natural history traits (e.g., body size, reproductive mode, thermal tolerance, habitat association) and for which data on life-history traits, ecology, genetics and occurrence records are readily available. We restricted our analysis to species whose entire distributional range fell within the boundary of the climate data used in this study (approx. 135.7–153.7 °E, 23.6–39.5 °S). Overall, 17 species, belonging to the families Scincidae (88%), Agamidae (6%) and Varanidae (6%), were analyzed.</p>
