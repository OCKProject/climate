<p id="Par45" class="p">The nest temperature of many reptiles determines the sex of offspring (temperature-dependent sex determination, TSD). The correlation between temperature and offspring sex ratio implies that even modest increases in mean temperature may dramatically skew the sex ratio. High increases in temperature (&gt;4 °C) could potentially eliminate production of male offspring thereby reducing population viability
