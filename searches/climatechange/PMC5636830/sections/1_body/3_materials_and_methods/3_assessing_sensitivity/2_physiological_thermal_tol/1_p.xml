<p id="Par39" class="p">Changes in body temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">b</sub>) influences the physiological sensitivity and fitness of ectotherms. Very high Tb reduces an organisms’ fitness and can be lethal at the organism’s critical maximum temperature (CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>). An organism’s integrated fitness over some time is a function of its performance curve and the T
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> it experiences. Therefore, the physiological impact of climate change will depend on an organism’s field T
 <sub class="sub">b</sub> relative to its maximum performance temperature

The median temperature each species may be exposed to in the future was calculated by overlaying occurrence records with data describing future scenarios of mean annual temperature in southeastern Australia
