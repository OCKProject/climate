 </sup>, we used measures of genetic diversity as a proxy for adaptive potential. There are two type of genetic diversity: adaptive genetic diversity, which influences the fitness of individuals and populations and neutral genetic diversity, which confers no advantage, but may provide proxy for adaptive variation and means for monitoring gene flow and other demographic processes

 </sup>. Recent genomics analyses suggest that most adaptive genetic responses are based on small effect in many genes, rather than a few genes of large effect

 </sup>. These considerations suggest that evolutionary potential (a key component of adaptive capacity) is better predicted by overall genetic diversity than a focus on individual genes

 </sup>. Here we used neutral genetic variation (as measured by expected heterozygosity) as a proxy for adaptive potential. Expected heterozygosity (He) for the lizards (measured by microsatellite markers) were obtained from the published literature (for references see Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). In principle, species with relatively high genetic diversity are expected to have greater adaptive potential, hence we assigned higher adaptive capacity scores to species with mean He &gt; 0.8.
