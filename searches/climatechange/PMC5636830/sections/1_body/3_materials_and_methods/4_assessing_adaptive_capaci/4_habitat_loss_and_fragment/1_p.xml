 </sup>. To assess the availability of suitable habitat ant degree of habitat fragmentation for individual species, we overlaid speciesâ€™ current range maps with a GIS layer of the land use/land cover of Australia (Australian Land Use and Management [ALUM] Classification, version 7, May 2010, available at

For each species, we calculated the percentage of occupied grid cells that fell within pasture, crop and modified lands. We assigned a higher adaptive capacity score to species with more than 40% of their occupied grid cells within pasture, crop and modified lands, and a lower score to those with less than 10% of the occupied grid cells within these land cover types.
