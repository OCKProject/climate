<p id="Par37" class="p">For each GCM, we computed the change in climatically suitable habitat between the current and future projections as the percentage change in the number of suitable grid cells. We also calculated the percentage of overlap between current and future suitable habitat and the percentage of suitable habitat lost or gained within protected areas. For the latter, we obtained a GIS layer of the Australian protected area network from the Collaborative Australian Protected Area Database (CAPAD 2014; available at
