 </sup> to model the current and future distribution of suitable habitat for the 17 lizard species. Maxent is one of the most frequently used correlative SDMs because of its high predictive performance, computational efficiency and ease of use (Elith

We removed duplicate (points that occurred twice or more) and questionable records (i.e., records that had low positional accuracy and those fell outside the speciesâ€™ known range or known records outside the range) and those that were collected before 1950. Overall, we included more than 31,000 unique occurrence points (i.e., one point per the spatial resolution considered) for the 17 species.
