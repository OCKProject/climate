<p id="Par36" class="p">Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the True Skill Statistic (TSS) based on 10-fold cross-validation. AUC scores range from 0 to 1, with values of 1 indicating perfect binary classifier accuracy and 0.5 suggesting that model performance is no better than random. TSS scores range from −1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement between test data and model predictions, and scores of 0 or less indicate performance no better than random

 </sup>. Variables’ predictive ability and importance to the model were assessed by referring to their percentage contribution, and to the impacts of jack-knifing on model performance. A final model was fitted using all occurrence data, and habitat suitability maps were generated by projecting these models to current and future predictor data. The projected continuous habitat suitability maps were transformed into climatically suitable and unsuitable habitat using the equal training sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold
