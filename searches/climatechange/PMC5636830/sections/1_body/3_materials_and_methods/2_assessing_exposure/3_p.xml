<p id="Par34" class="p">We use a suite of five predictor climatic variables that have been shown to predict the distribution of reptiles very well

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>. These included annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, maximum temperature of the warmest month, minimum temperature of the coldest month and annual precipitation. Because microhabitats have been shown to play a significant role in thermal buffering and determining the presence of species at fine spatial resolutions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>
 </sup>, and given that the most of the study species dwell in crevices of granite rock outcrops, we included an index of rock cover (Weathering Intensity Index)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>
 </sup> as a static predictor variable. We consider this to be an important addition because the presence of rock outcrops with suitable crevices will largely determine range filling (i.e., colonization of suitable habitats within the species range) under climate change.
