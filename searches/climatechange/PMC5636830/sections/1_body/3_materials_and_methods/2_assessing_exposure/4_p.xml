<p id="Par35" class="p">We fitted the model using different combinations of Maxent features (i.e., linear, quadratic, product, threshold and hinge features), and varying levels of regularization, to control how tightly the model fitted the given occurrence points. The most realistic model settings as assessed by the smoothness of the response curves for our modelled species were linear, product, quadratic features, and a regularization multiplier of 1.5. To reduce over-prediction, background points were sampled from areas within 100 kilometres of occurrence localities. The fitted model was projected onto the current (20-year time period centred on 2000) and three future time slices (2030, 2050 and 2070). Future projections were constrained using a buffer of 300 km around the current distribution across all species to prevent the model predicting climatically suitable habitats in areas too far beyond the species’ range.</p>
