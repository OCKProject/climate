<p id="Par15" class="p">Although the vulnerability scores for individual species varied across the four climate scenarios and three time horizons (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>), membership within the three vulnerability categories remained relatively similar. Generally, there were no significant differences between the two scoring schemes or between the CCVA with (ES) and without (ESA) adaptive capacity (Fisher’s exact test: df = 32,

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). There was an exception, however. In the unweighted scoring scheme, under the warm/dry scenario for 2070, omitting adaptive capacity led to five additional species being classified as highly vulnerable, compared to the two (
