 <italic class="italic">Lissolepis coventryi</italic> was the only species projected to gain (26%-136%) climatically suitable habitat under all climate scenarios and time horizons considered (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The proportion of species assigned to the three exposure categories (low, moderate and high) also varied with climate trajectory and time horizon. In general, most species were assigned to the moderate and low exposure categories (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">Eulamprus leuraensis</italic> was the only species assigned to the high exposure category under all the climate trajectories and time horizons considered.
