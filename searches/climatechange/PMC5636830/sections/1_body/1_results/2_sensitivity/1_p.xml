<p id="Par13" class="p">Two species were categorised as having high sensitivity to climate change: 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">leuraensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coventryi</italic>, both of which are habitat specialists, have small population sizes and narrow geographic range sizes. The remaining species were assigned to the moderate sensitivity category, with scores between 55–66 for the unweighted score and 40–64 for the weighted score. Sensitivity scores for the two scoring schemes were strongly correlated (Spearman’s correlation, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 </sub> = 0.91, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 32, 
 <italic class="italic">p &lt; </italic>0.01), and although the unweighted scores were higher than the weighted scores (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) this had no effect on the proportion and identity of the species assigned to the various sensitivity categories.
