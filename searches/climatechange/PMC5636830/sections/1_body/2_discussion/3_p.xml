<p id="Par19" class="p">The species that are not currently at risk from climate change could also be categorized as being potential adapters, potential persisters, or as having high latent risk, depending on their exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity rankings. Each of these classes has particular implications for conservation management

Species with high latent risk are those with high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity, but are currently not highly exposed to climate change. These species are not of immediate management concern, but could become highly vulnerable if exposed beyond the modelled time frame or if the rate of change in exposure outpaces that in the GCMs that we used
