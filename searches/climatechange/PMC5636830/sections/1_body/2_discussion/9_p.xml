<p id="Par25" class="p">Majority of our study lizards have high neutral genetic diversity (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) and should this indeed be a good proxy for adaptive genetic variation, then it mean that they could adapt to climate change (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). However, it is still debated if neutral genetic diversity is a good proxy for variation under natural selection
