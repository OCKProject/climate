 </sup>. Therefore, different algorithms, and future changes in climate that do not conform to the climate trajectories used in the present study, could provide dramatically different exposure estimates and hence species vulnerability rankings. Other external stressors that were not accounted for, such as predation, competition and invasion, and potential disease outbreaks could substantially influence vulnerability to climate change
