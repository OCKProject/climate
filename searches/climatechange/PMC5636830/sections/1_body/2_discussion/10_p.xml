<p id="Par26" class="p">We ranked the dispersal capacity of lizards based on their body size, however, in general, lizards have limited dispersal capacity compared to large mammals and most birds. As yet, it is unclear if the localized mobility of lizards is sufficient to keep up with the pace of climate change
