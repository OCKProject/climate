 </sup>. Yet, we demonstrate that ignoring adaptive capacity can influence the results; more species were classified as highly vulnerable, especially under the weighted scheme. This may impede reliable identification of conservation priorities, leading to suboptimal use of limited conservation resources. This emphasizes the need to comprehensively assess all three elements of vulnerability where such data are available, as advocated by recent studies
