<p id="Par24" class="p">Like exposure and sensitivity, adaptive capacity scores are relative and are sensitive to the kind and number of variables used. Also, there is no consensus on how to assess the relative importance the components of adaptive capacity. However, using the same set of fundamental adaptive capacity variable, genetic diversity, dispersal and migratory capacity and phenotypic plasticity

 </sup> in the same order of importance across the 17 lizard species increases the level of confidence of the vulnerability rankings of these species. This can guide prioritization of the species for conservation, although future studies will be crucial to evaluate the actual contributions of each variable to adaptive capacity across species in space and time.
