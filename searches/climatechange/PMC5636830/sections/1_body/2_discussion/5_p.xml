<p id="Par21" class="p">The species assigned to the high exposure category are projected to experience greater losses in climatically suitable habitat than those assigned to the moderate and low categories. This supports the findings of other studies on Australian reptiles

 </sup> and suggests that loss in climatically suitable habitat will be a key driver of the vulnerability of lizards in Australia. For species with sufficient dispersal capabilities, creating and maintaining connectivity between current and future habitat may be necessary to facilitate their movement across the landscape
