 </sup>. Here, we applied a CCVA framework that integrates speciesâ€™ exposure, sensitivity and capacity for adapting to climate change, to 17 lizard species distributed across the Great Dividing Range of Australia. As hypothesized, we found that incorporating adaptive capacity into a CCVA influenced the composition of species assigned to the various vulnerability categories, although there were exceptions. Our results also highlighted how the degree of exposure to climate change is temporally dynamic, and ought to be assessed over multiple time horizons to facilitate informed, species-specific management decisions. Our findings provide relevant information to guide conservation strategies for Australian lizards under climate change.
