 </sup>. Although we used only correlative SDM, future studies will benefit from the inclusion of mechanistic models in the projection of species distributions under climate change. Also, given that vulnerability categorization is relative, it is crucial to validate the vulnerability index, from even a small geographical area. Although this was beyond the scope of this study, it can be done via laboratory experiment or long-term field studies.
