<p id="Par29" class="p">We have shown that the choice of CCVA frameworks and scoring schemes can influence the proportion and composition of species assigned to the different vulnerability categories. Sensitivity, exposure and adaptive capacity traits are unlikely to contribute equally to scores of species vulnerability to climate change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, and intuitively, weighted scores may provide a more realistic assessment. However, given the lack of empirical evidence to support vulnerability trait scores, it remains difficult to select an appropriate weighting scheme
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. This is further complicated by the large number of variables that may be relevant for different taxonomic groups. Furthermore, even within a relatively small clade such as that investigated here, different variables may vary dramatically in their importance, across the species. Our study indicates that there is greater congruence between weighted and unweighted speciesâ€™ vulnerability rankings when all three elements of vulnerability (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity) are integrated. Further studies are needed on other taxa, such as mammals and birds, and from various geographical areas to test the generality of our findings.
