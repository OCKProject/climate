 <italic class="italic">frerei</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">cunninghami</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kingii</italic> are highly exposed under at least one climate scenario and time slice, and have high adaptive capacity, but moderate sensitivity to climate change. These species are therefore borderline potential adapters and must be monitored to ensure they retain stable populations over time. Under both schemes, 
 <italic class="italic">Lissolepis coventryi</italic> has low exposure, high sensitivity and moderate adaptive capacity across all the climate scenarios and at least two time slices. This species lies at the border of high latent risk and not of immediate conservation concern. Species that are highly exposed, but have moderate sensitivity and adaptive capacity, such as 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">leuraensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tympanum</italic> are also not of immediate concern, but represent new priorities for conservation. Changes to external stressors, such as habitat degradation and high predation, competition and disease, which increase their sensitivity and decrease their adaptive capacity may result in these species becoming more vulnerable to climate change.
