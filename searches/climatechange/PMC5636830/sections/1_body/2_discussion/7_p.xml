<p id="Par23" class="p">Our study identified only two species as highly vulnerable to climate change. However, these results should be interpreted with caution, because we only considered 17 species in our analysis, and it is possible that we excluded several species that are highly vulnerable to climate change. For example, the montane specialist skink 
 <italic class="italic">Lampropholis robertsi</italic> and its congener 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">coggeri</italic> are endemic to rainforests of northeast Australia, have relatively narrow distributions, occur within a narrow climatic zone, and have relatively low dispersal capacity. These characteristics suggest they might be highly vulnerable to climate change, but they were not included in our analysis because their occurrence records were too few to allow for reliable models.
