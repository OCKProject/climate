<p id="Par18" class="p">When all three elements of vulnerability were integrated, the difference between the number of species within the various vulnerability categories under the weighted and unweighted schemes were not significant (Fisher’s exact test: df = 32; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The composition of species within the three vulnerability categories also did not change. The majority (≥59%) of lizard species were classified as moderately vulnerable under both schemes, with only one to two assigned to the high vulnerability category (weighted and unweighted schemes, respectively). The two species, 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">leuraensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kosciuskoi</italic>, were assigned to the high vulnerability category. The key contributors to their vulnerability were substantial losses in the spatial extent of climatically suitable habitat, narrow thermal tolerance, small geographic range, and low dispersal capacity. However, it has been suggested that species assigned to a high vulnerability category may persist if they are able to adapt to the novel future climate

 </sup>. Although both

 <italic class="italic">leuraensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">kosciuskoi</italic> have moderate adaptive capacity, this measure is relative and does not highlight a species’ true capacity to adapt to changes in climate

 </sup>. As such, active monitoring and management of these species might be necessary to prevent climate-driven extinction. Actions should be aimed at reducing their sensitivity to climate change; external stressors, such as habitat loss and degradation, predation by feral cats, and competition with invasive species should be managed. Where there is evidence that their populations are declining over time, assisted migration may be necessary to safeguard the species from extinction.
