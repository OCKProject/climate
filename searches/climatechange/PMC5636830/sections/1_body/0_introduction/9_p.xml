<p id="Par10" class="p">Another difference in the approach to CCVA is whether all traits incorporated into the analysis contribute equally to a species’ vulnerability score. Both unweighted and weighted scoring schemes (where the latter attempts to capture the perceived relative contribution of the various traits to vulnerability) have been used e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>, but the outcome of these scoring systems have been rarely compared.
