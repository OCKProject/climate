 </sup>. Most CCVAs have assessed sensitivity using life-history traits, including physiological, behavioural or ecological traits, such as tolerance to temperature or hydrological regimes, habitat specificity and dietary specialization, occupied area, population size, reproductive rate, temperature-dependent sex determination, clutch size, growth rate, generation length, and life span
