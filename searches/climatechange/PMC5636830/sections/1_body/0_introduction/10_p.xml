<p id="Par11" class="p">Here, we adopted and extended existing CCVA frameworks to include the capacity of species to adapt to climate change and explored the different approaches to undertaking CCVAs. Our main objective was to assess the relative vulnerability of 17 lizard species distributed partly or wholly along the Great Dividing Range of southeastern Australia, and the factors that make them susceptible to climate change. In doing so, we evaluated the extent to which the omission of adaptive capacity in CCVA, and the weighting of scoring schemes, influences the assessment outcome. Specifically, we asked the following questions: (i) Which species are most vulnerable to climate change and what factors are responsible for their vulnerability? (ii) Does the omission of adaptive capacity influence the outcome of CCVAs? (iii) What effect does unweighted and weighted systems have on the outcome of CCVAs? We hypothesize that the number and composition of species ranked as highly vulnerable could change when adaptive capacity is included in the CCVA. We also expect the weighted system to influence the composition and order of species listed under different vulnerability categories.</p>
