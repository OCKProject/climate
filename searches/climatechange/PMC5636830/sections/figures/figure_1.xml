  <p class="p">Weighted and unweighted exposure scores for 17 Australian lizards under projected climate change by 2050. Exposure was assessed using four contrasting future climate scenarios that are equally plausible: hot/wet; warm/dry; hot/similar precipitation; and warm/ wet scenarios. Score ≥0.67 is high, from 0.33 to 0.66 is moderate and &lt;0.33 is low. See Supporting Information Figures
