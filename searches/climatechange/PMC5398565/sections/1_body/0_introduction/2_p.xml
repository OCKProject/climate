<p class="p">Peatlands are categorized as ombrotrophic (bogs) or minerotrophic (fens) based on their hydrological, chemical, and biotic structure. Bogs are fed by atmospheric water sources and are acidic, nutrient poor, and dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species. Fens are fed by surface water (e.g. rivers and lakes) and are acidic or alkaline and composed of a mixture of mosses (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> and feather mosses) and vascular plants (e.g. sedges). Fens are further characterized as rich or poor. Poor fens are acidic, dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic>, and are considered one of the successional stages of bog development [
