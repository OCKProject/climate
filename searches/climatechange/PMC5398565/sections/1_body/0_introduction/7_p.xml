<p class="p">Here, we use a simple but novel data integration method to assess the environmental attributes and potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland under current and future climates. Specifically, we use 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species distributions as a proxy for predicting 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland distribution and ask how species coexistence and climate variables influence the spatial pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland distribution under current and projected climate conditions. We address these questions using single- and multi-species (integrated records) distribution models generated at 1-km resolution to evaluate the environmental attributes of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic>-peatland distributions in North America. We then use these correlates to assess how climate change might affect the future distribution of peatlands in North America.
