<p class="p">Northern peatlands are important for global carbon storage, holding ~30% of global soil carbon [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Peatlands develop under cool temperatures and high moisture and thus are tightly regulated by climate [

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Peatlands accumulate carbon when net primary productivity exceeds decomposition, with decomposition limited by both the waterlogged conditions that characterize peatlands [
