<p class="p">In nature, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species are distributed along a microtopographical moisture gradient whereby some species typically occur in wetter hollows while others occur on drier hummocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The water economy of a 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species, and thus its position along the hummock-hollow gradient, is mediated by its growth form. Hummock species maintain tighter stems and dense canopy integration that help prevent desiccation [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], whereas hollow species tend to maintain a loose canopy and robust physical structure. Hollow species tend to grow faster than hummock species, resulting in generally higher net primary productivity in hollows than on hummocks [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species lack roots or stomata [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], meaning that their water status, survival, and dispersal are more tightly regulated by the climate compared to vascular plants, which can regulate transpiration and carbon uptake through their roots and stomata.
