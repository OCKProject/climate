<p class="p">The lack of congruence between these findings can be explored by understanding the important environmental factors influencing 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> distributions and how changes in these factors might affect the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland. Peatlands are formed by two major processes: paludification (from poor drainage) and terrestrialization (infilling of a water body by organic and inorganic sources), with paludification being more common [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. While paludification is often initiated by stochastic events such as excessive precipitation, peatland formation through paludification likely occurs in regions where the prevailing climate can sustain the supply of water [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. That is, for peatland development to occur, the prevailing conditions must favour 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> growth and dispersal. Thus, the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species can be used as a proxy for understanding the environmental correlates of peatland distributions. This can be accomplished using bioclimatic species distribution models that integrate a species’ spatial occurrences with co-occurring environmental variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to model the species’ current distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The relevant environmental variables can then be combined with future climate projections to project the species’ future climate distribution.
