<p class="p">Although variants of bioclimatic models have been used previously to describe 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic>-peatland distributions, those models were generated at a low resolution (~50 x 50 km) using coarse environmental variables such as mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP) [

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. MAT and MAP can be poorly discriminating in terms of matching the spatial characteristics (or physiology) of species to their environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. For instance, Gunnarson [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] found that global productivity of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> increases with increasing MAT and MAP, but this is true for many species found in northern climates and is not necessarily informative for effectively linking 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species growth with their patterns of distribution. Although peatland typically occurs within a MAT of -12 to 5°C and a MAP of 200–1000 mm (which falls within the boreal axis), there is evidence that peatlands occupy a much broader and potentially drier climate extent [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Furthermore, MAT and MAP are often correlated with several other variables, and when incorporated into a model, could mask the effects of more physiologically important variables. Climate seasonality and local factors such as topography and geology also influence peatland formation and persistence [
