<p class="p">For comparison with individual species distributions, we generated two data sets of multi-species occurrence records: “peatland” and “all species”. Well-developed 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatlands are characterized by hummock-hollow microtopography, and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fuscum</italic> is typically found on hummocks. Thus, if 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fuscum</italic> occurs (i.e., shares the same coordinates) with one or more other typical 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species, there is a high probability that 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland occurs in that location and a low probability that the records were collected in non-peatland habitat. The peatland data set comprised all records where 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fuscum</italic> coincided with at least one of the other three species (34, 104 and 72 records of 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">angustifolium</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicum</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rubellum</italic>, respectively; total of 210 occurrences). We used 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">fuscum</italic> in this respect because it is one of the most common and abundant peat-forming 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species in northern peatlands (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]) and it is also easier to identify than most 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species. In contrast, the all-species data set comprised all unique records from all four 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species. The spatial distribution of these records across North America (
