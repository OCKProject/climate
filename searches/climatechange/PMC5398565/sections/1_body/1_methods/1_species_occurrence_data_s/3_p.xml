<p class="p">The models were limited to the spatial extent of North America, north of the 37th parallel for the following reasons. Although some 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species have circumboreal or cosmopolitan distributions (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">magellanicum</italic> also occurs in South America), peatland does not always occur where there is 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic>. Furthermore, the greatest individual abundances should occur within the optimal range of environmental tolerances, and 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species are mainly northern plants. Finally, the large latitudinal gradient and high climate differential covered by records from North America should be sufficient to include the climate envelope of most 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> species.
