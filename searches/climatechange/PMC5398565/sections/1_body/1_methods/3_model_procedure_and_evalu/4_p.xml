<p class="p">Finally, we divided the suitability scores into three classes to enable qualitative and quantitative assessments of the pattern of suitability between the models. We classified the model results such that a probability threshold of 0.2 = absence, 0.2–0.4 = low suitability, 0.4–0.6 = medium suitability, and 0.6–1 = high suitability locations. The 0.2 threshold represents the probability (to one decimal place) above which an environment is deemed suitable based on the 10th percentile training presence threshold that was applied to the models. We calculated the number of pixels in each suitability class &gt; 0.2 and compared current models and future projections for the amount of area in each suitability class. For this comparison, we averaged across the three GCMs for each model.</p>
