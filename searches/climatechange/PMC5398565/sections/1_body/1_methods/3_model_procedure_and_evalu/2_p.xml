<p class="p">Models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), where a score of 0.5 is random, between 0.8 and 0.9 is good, and &gt; 0.9 is excellent [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The importance of each environmental variable was evaluated using three indices: percent contribution of individual variables in explaining the variance in the model; a jackknife test, which indicates the modelâ€™s performance in the absence of a variable compared to that in its presence; and permutation importance, which estimates the decline in the model AUC as the variables are permutated randomly across the data set.
