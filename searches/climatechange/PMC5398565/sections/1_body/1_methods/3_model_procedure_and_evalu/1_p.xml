<p class="p">We first generated models using Maxent 3.3.3k [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], which is a presence-only modelling algorithm that incorporates the spatial attributes of a species with the environmental conditions that constrain its distribution to predict areas of suitability for that species [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Maxent models the distribution of a species as a logistic function of the environmental variables. Details of this method are discussed extensively elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. We generated 18 current models (3 GCMs x 6 data sets) and projected these models to 2050 for four single-species, one peatland, and one all-species data sets. We generated 10 replicates for each model using cross-validation by splitting the records into k = 10 folds (equal size subsamples), with k– 1 folds used to train the models and the remaining 1 fold used to test the models. Cross-validation limits spatial bias and model over-fitting. To allow model comparisons across species, we used the hinge feature, which generates easily interpreted non-linear models similar to generalized additive models [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. For comparison, we generated additional models using the “all features” default function, which allows fitting of combinations of different statistical features for the models. The results were similar and are not reported here. We also explored the effects of MAT and MAP on model performance by including these variables as additional predictors in the models for peatland and all-species records. We used a 10th percentile training presence threshold such that suitable locations excluded the 10% least suitable occurrence locations [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. This threshold was selected because some occurrence records may occur outside peatlands, and the threshold excludes locations that may be atypical for the species.
