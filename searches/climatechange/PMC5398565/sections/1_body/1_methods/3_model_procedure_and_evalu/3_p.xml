<p class="p">We investigated the disparities in the extent of suitable area between each current model and its future projection based on estimates of niche breadth calculated using ENMTools [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Niche breadth ranges from 0–1 and represents the range of environments that a species can inhabit [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]; it allows quantitative estimates of changes in peatland distribution between current and future models. We estimated the extent of spatial deviation between models by calculating pair-wise niche overlap (ranges from 0–1) using ENMTools. We determined the extent of agreement among the three future projections for each species distribution model by computing and mapping their coefficients of variation.
