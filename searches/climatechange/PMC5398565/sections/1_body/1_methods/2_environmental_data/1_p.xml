 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] for the current (1950–2000) climate and three general circulation models (GCMs) for the 2050 climate scenario based on representative concentration pathway +2.6. We used three GCMs because there is greater variability among GCMs than scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The GCMs were the Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model (HadGEM2-ES), the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies model (GISS-E2-R), and the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM1-1). We also derived two additional variables for current and future climate: growing season temperature (GST) and soil moisture deficit (SMD). GST was calculated as the mean of May–August temperature; SMD was calculated as the difference between annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (PET) such that higher values of SMD indicate wetter areas and lower values indicate drier areas. PET data were obtained from the Consortium for Spatial Information (

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]). In total, we screened 22 variables as potential predictors by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients within the environmental space of the study area in ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175978.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). After screening, five biologically relevant variables that had little correlation across the environmental space were retained for modelling: temperature of the driest quarter (TDQ), temperature of the wettest quarter (TWQ), precipitation of the warmest quarter (PWQ), GST, and SMD. All environmental variables were extracted at 30 arc seconds (~1 km
