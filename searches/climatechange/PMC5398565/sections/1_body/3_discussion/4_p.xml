<p class="p">Finally, because regional climates are strongly influenced by local geophysical factors such as large-scale orography (changes in air flow due to topographic interference), the pattern of

 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatlands in other regions, particularly those in Eurasia. For instance, Broccoli and Manabe [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] found that dryness in the continental interior of western North America is enhanced by the climate-modulating effect of the Rocky Mountains. Because excessive moisture is a prerequisite for
