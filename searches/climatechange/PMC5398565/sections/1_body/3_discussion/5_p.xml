<p class="p">In conclusion, all models indicate that there could be a future increase in suitable climate area for 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatlands, particularly in coastal regions. That is, at least in the immediate future, warming could be balanced by the projected increase in precipitation, which could enhance 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> productivity. Future experimental studies that investigate the response of peatlands to warming and moisture levels should consider future climate projections in the design of such studies, especially those that manipulate peatland hydrology (i.e., water table drawdown). Although warming is occurring, increased precipitation is also projected for much of North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Uncritically drawing down the peatland water table or not balancing a drawdown with the corresponding temperature projections could result in misleading inferences concerning the link between temperature and moisture effects on peatland vegetation.
