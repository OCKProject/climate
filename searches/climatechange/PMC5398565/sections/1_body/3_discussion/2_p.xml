<p class="p">Choosing among single-species models and these two types of multi-species models would depend on their end use. Because our two types of multi-species models incorporate the environmental tolerances of multiple species in different ways, they may over- or underestimate the distribution of any one species. Thus, these types of models might not be well suited for conservation applications focusing on a single species. However, for species that have similar physiological requirements, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic>, models generated from integrated records (i.e., co-occurrences) are likely more representative of a particular habitat distribution such as 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland. Therefore, this type of multi-species model is better suited to system-specific modelling. For instance, Oke et al., [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] used a system-specific query to retrieve occurrence records and model the distribution of nine plant species that typically co-exist in rock barrens, and the species were found to respond consistently to the same set of variables that characterizes rock barrens.
