<p class="p">Although the models vary somewhat in their coverage, the general patterns of climate suitability are consistent, and the estimates of niche breadth, niche overlap, and suitable space consistently support the claim that climate warming could enhance

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Indeed, 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> growth increases with warming and photoperiod [

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The models therefore suggest that warming would be effectively balanced by precipitation in places where 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatlands typically occur. Because peatlands are believed to exist mainly under cool boreal climate, suitable space for 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatlands might intuitively be expected to expand into the northern and north-central parts of North America with increased warming. However, these regions are characterized by cold, dry, arctic climate, and considering the stochastic nature of paludification, the prevailing conditions may not support frequent peatland initiation or

 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Furthermore, spore records indicate that the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">Sphagnum</italic> peatland distribution since the last glacial maximum (ca. 22â€“20 ka) has largely occurred in the eastern and western regions of North America, with limited north-central expansion [
 <xref rid="pone.0175978.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Despite the projected increase in precipitation for the northern region, there is little indication that
