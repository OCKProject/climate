<p class="p">Total suitable area was greatest for the all-species model and lowest for the peatland model for both current and future climate; this difference was mainly driven by differences in the areas of low and moderate suitability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175978.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Although all three GCMs projected increases in total suitable area, there were differences among suitability classes, species models, and climate models (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175978.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Changes in low-suitability area were negative in half of the cases and were generally small, whereas increases in area were greatest for moderate suitability for the

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175978.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For future projections, there were notable increases in high-suitability area on the coasts, but no to moderate increases in high-suitability area in the continental interior (
