<p class="p">Niche breadths for the all-species distributions were 9.7–33.4% and 9.7–33.1% broader than those of the other current models and future projections, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175978.s004" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). Compared to peatland, the all-species niche breadth was 33.4% and 30.1–33.1% broader for current and future models, respectively, and the niche overlap was 82% and 78–84% for current and future models, respectively. The niche overlap between the all-species and each of the single-species distributions was 83–93% for the current models and 77–93% for future projections; the niche overlap between the peatland and each of the single-species distributions was 80–88% for the current models and 77–89% for the future projections. The coefficients of variation for the future projections were generally low (&lt; 0.1) in areas predicted as suitable, indicating good agreement among the projections (
