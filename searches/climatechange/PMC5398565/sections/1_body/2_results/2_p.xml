<p class="p">The environmental variables SMD and TDQ explained the greatest amounts of model variance (30.4–63.1% and 26.9–49.8%, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175978.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In addition, SMD and TDQ were positively correlated (within the peatland data set: Spearman ρ = 0.71, N = 210, P &lt; 0.0001), with peatlands having low SMD (drier) at temperatures below approximately 5°C and a greater range of SMD at temperatures &gt; 5°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175978.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). GST explained moderate amounts of model variance (6.4–14.6%) and was uncorrelated with SMD (ρ = -0.05, N = 210, P = 0.5) and only weakly correlated with TDQ (ρ = 0.29, N = 210, P &lt; 0.0001). PWQ and TWQ explained relatively little model variance (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0175978.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Permutation importance and jackknife tests also indicated that SMD, TDQ and GST were the most important variables in the models (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175978.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). This was also consistent for the consensus models. Given that TDQ ranged from -26.3 to 18.8 whereas MAT ranged from -13.9 to 11.3 for the peatland records, we further explored the peatland records within this climate space. For TDQ, most of the records &lt; 0°C are located inland, whereas those &gt; 1°C are more coastal. This pattern is not observed for MAT. As expected, both TDQ and MAT, and SMD and MAP, were correlated (ρ = 0.84, N = 210, P &lt; 0.0001 and ρ = 0.95, N = 210, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). Furthermore, when MAP and MAT were included in the models, MAP masked the contribution of SMD, and the models were generally less interpretable because the model evaluation metrics contradicted one another (see
