<p class="p">Leaf phenology is a key adaptive trait that determines carbon balance (production and accumulation) and the overall growth of plant species, while also affecting ecosystem productivity (Kramer et al., 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>; Larcher, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). Bud burst, and leaf senescence are the most important leaf phenological traits used in studies, since they mark the onset, duration and ending of a species growth period. Bud burst reflects the transition phase from the winter dormancy to the onset of next year's growth period and requires a preceding chilling period (Heide, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Kramer et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Late bud burst can protect trees from late frosts but can also shorten their growth period (Lechowicz, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1984</xref>; Višnjić and Dohrenbusch, 
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). Bud burst is referred to be under genetic-provenance control (Robson et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), while it is can be also directly affected by environmental factors such as temperature and photoperiod (e.g., Heide, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>; Yan and Wallace, 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Basler and Körner, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Schüler and Liesebach, 
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Kramer et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, a limited number of studies exist on the possible effect of water availability on bud burst timing of temperate forest trees (e.g., Morin et al., 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Kuster et al., 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The time of leaf senescence determines the end of the growing period and the onset of winter dormancy and strongly depends on the environmental factors during the current year. For example, premature leaf senescence can be observed under low summer and autumn precipitation, to mobilize leaf nutrients (Sedigheh et al., 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Gill et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Tombesi et al., 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), while leaf senescence can be delayed by higher autumnal temperatures (Fu et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), as well as by an increased photoperiod (Way and Montgomery, 
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Gill et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Furthermore, it is also influenced by spring leaf phenology (Fu et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Keenan and Richardson, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Panchen et al., 
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) and at the same time it can affect leaf flushing in the next year (Heide, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>).
