<p class="p">The adaptive potential of tree populations can be described through various parameters such as growth, survival and shifts in phenology (Eckhart et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Seedling growth can be severely affected by abiotic stressors such as temperature and water deficiency. As climate becomes warmer and summer precipitation is expected to decline, beech populations may face intense drought periods (Geßler et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Under water stress, plants usually decrease growth in terms of both height and biomass accumulation because of minimization in carbon fixation through photosynthesis. In addition, low soil water potential affects hydraulic traits (e.g., conductivity) and can create xylem cavities leading to plant mortality (Bolte et al., 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). For this reason, survival under environmental stress is an important adaptive trait, since it reflects the regeneration dynamics of populations (Ngulube,
