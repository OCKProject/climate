<p class="p">The European beech (
 <italic class="italic">Fagus sylvatica</italic> L.) is one of the most important tree species in the continent, both economically and ecologically. Its geographical range extends from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean covering various habitats (Bolte et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Willner et al., 
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). It is generally considered as an oceanic species that can grow in areas with mild winters and moist summers, sensitive to intense drought periods in the growing season (Fotelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Leuschner et al., 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Bolte et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Granier et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Pšidová et al., 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Several studies report that beech populations in Southern Europe have faced strong selective pressures during the last decades (Jump et al., 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Piovesan et al., 
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>), which are expected to become more intense because of future changes in rainfall patterns and temperatures under the forthcoming climate change (Charru et al., 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Rita et al., 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), arising concerns about the survival dynamics of the European populations (Bréda et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Geßler et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Besides increased drought, climate change is expected to cause temporal shifts in the occurrence of cold events, too early or too late in respect to the winter period. To overcome these negative consequences on the future performance of beech forests in afforestation programs in Europe, several authors suggest testing and using beech ecotypes that are adapted to a less oceanic climate (Schraml and Rennenberg, 
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Nielsen and Jørgensen, 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Meier and Leuschner, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Rose et al., 
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), such as the refugial beech populations from Southern Europe (Rennenberg et al., 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Geßler et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) that are expected to be adapted both to cold events and extended periods of drought during their growing season (St Clair and Howe, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Fotelli et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Eilmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Thiel et al., 
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Dounavi et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>).
