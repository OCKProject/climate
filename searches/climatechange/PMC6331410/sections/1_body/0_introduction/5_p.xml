<p class="p">The aim of our study was to describe the adaptive potential of beech populations in the southeastern part of Europe (N.E. Greece) to climate change. Two hypotheses about the adaptive potential of beech were tested: (a) Beech provenances from sites with longer drought intervals in summer should be better adapted to the expected environmental conditions under climate change and (b) differences in temporal distribution patterns of precipitation should trigger different physiological responses in beech trees. In order to test these hypotheses, a provenance test was established in a growth chamber, where controlled climate change conditions of temperature and precipitation for the year 2050 were simulated. Seedling survival, growth, and leaf phenology were used as adaptive traits for 3 years. Seedling survival was also tested for the same provenances in a field trial under natural conditions allowing comparisons between the adaptability of provenances under both current environmental conditions and the ones anticipated under climate change.</p>
