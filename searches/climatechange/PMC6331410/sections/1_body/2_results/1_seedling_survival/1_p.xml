<p class="p">The direct comparison of survival percentages and the HLM model comparison produced similar results as far as seedling survival is concerned. The lowest survival rates were observed under field conditions for all populations, in comparison with the ones observed in the growth chamber (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Populations E1 and E2 showed the lowest and population D3 and the local population D4 the highest survival in the field (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). In the growth chamber, average survival was generally higher under frequent irrigation (scheme A2) than under less frequent irrigation (scheme A1). Besides E1 that demonstrated equal survival for both irrigation schemes, all populations showed lower survival percentages under A1 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). A clear provenance pattern was observed in the chamber, with populations from Evros surviving better under longer drought intervals (A1 scheme) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). No significant differences in seedling survival were found among populations under short drought intervals (scheme A2) (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
