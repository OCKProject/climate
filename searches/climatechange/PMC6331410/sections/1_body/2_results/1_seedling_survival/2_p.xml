<p class="p">When the results of both experiments were considered in total, the comparison of the HLM models showed that only the growing environment had a significant effect on seedling survival (Tables 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Separately for irrigation scheme A1 in the growth chamber, provenance demonstrated a significant effect on survival, while no effect was recorded under A2. In the field experiment, population was the only significant factor affecting seedling survival. Accordingly, the partition of variance for the overall survival in both experiments was explained to a great extent by the different growing environments (73%), while provenance and population had no effect at all (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">5D</xref>). A larger proportion of variance was explained by population than by provenance under field conditions and under the irrigation scheme A1 in the growth chamber, while under A2 both provenance and population accounted for a small fraction of the overall variance (10.8 and 10.3%, respectively).
