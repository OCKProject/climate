<p class="p">For leaf senescence, differences among populations in 2014 were found only under frequent irrigation (A2 scheme), in contrast to bud burst. No difference was recorded in 2015 for both schemes, while minor differences among populations were recorded in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). Under longer drought intervals (irrigation scheme A1), differences among populations occurred in the third year of the experiment (2016), with seedlings belonging to population E3 demonstrating a later leaf senescence than the remaining populations. Under A2, leaf senescence occurred the earliest in population E2 and the latest in D2 and D3 during 2014, while in 2016 only population D3 showed a significantly later leaf senescence.
