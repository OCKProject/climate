<p class="p">The comparison of the HLM models revealed a similar trend for the timing of bud burst, leaf senescence and the length of the growing period, during the 3 years of the experiment (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). The irrigation scheme had a significant influence on all traits in the first 2 years of the experiment (2014 and 2015), but not for the last year (2016). An opposite trend was observed for population and provenance that had significant effects on bud burst and growing period in 2015 and 2016, but not in 2014. Provenance showed a significant influence on the time of leaf senescence only in the first year and population only in the last year of the study. The frequency of irrigation (schemes A1 or A2) was the only fixed effect explaining a significant proportion of variance in 2014 for all traits, while in 2016, only (or mostly) provenance and population explained part of the variance. Provenance explained a larger proportion of variance (28.6%) than population (22.8%) for bud burst in the third year of the study, while an opposite trend was observed for leaf senescence (14.5% for population and 11.3% for provenance) and the growing period (28.3% for population and 18.6% for provenance).
