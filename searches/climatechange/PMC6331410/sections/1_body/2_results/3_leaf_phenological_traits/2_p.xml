<p class="p">Differences in leaf phenological traits were also observed among populations within each irrigation scheme. Under longer drought intervals (scheme A1), differences in bud burst among populations were recorded in all years of the experiment, while such differences were observed in 2015 and 2016 only, when irrigation was more frequent (scheme A2) (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In the first year of the experiment (2014), under A1, population E1 had the earliest bud burst and D4 the latest. This pattern largely changed in 2015, with E1 and E4 demonstrating the latest bud burst, while all Drama populations showed the earliest bud burst. In both 2015 and 2016, seedlings belonging to provenance Evros demonstrated a delay in bud burst in comparison to provenance Drama, under both irrigation schemes.
