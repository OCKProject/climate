<p class="p">In the growth chamber, beech seedlings demonstrated longer growing periods in all populations and during all years under frequent irrigation (scheme A2), in comparison to scheme A1, where irrigation was less frequent and drought intervals were longer. In the spring of 2014, bud burst occurred significantly earlier in the growth chamber under irrigation scheme A2, in comparison to A1, for seedlings belonging to all populations besides E1 and E4 (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). However, in 2015, only populations E2 and E3 continued to have significant differences in bud burst between A1 and A2, while in 2016, no significant differences could be observed between the two irrigation schemes. For leaf senescence, significant differences between the irrigation schemes were observed in all populations of Drama in 2014 and in some populations in 2015 (D3 and D4), but not in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In all cases for which significant differences were observed, leaf senescence under A2 occurred later than under A1. Significant differences in the length of the growing period between A1 and A2 schemes were present for all populations besides E1 and E4 in 2014 (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). In 2015, only population E3 did not differ significantly between A1 and A2 and finally in 2016 no difference between the two schemes was detected.
