<p class="p">Seedlings demonstrated plastic responses between subsequent years in this study (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). The greatest delay in bud burst between years 2014–2015 was found for population E1 (+19 days), while seedlings belonging to D3 and D4 flushed much earlier in the second year of the study (−21 and −20 days, respectively), under A1. Under irrigation scheme A2, populations E2 and E4 had a significantly delayed bud burst in 2016 as compared to 2015. For leaf senescence, all populations showed a similar plastic response trend for both irrigation schemes A1 and A2 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">7</xref>). Seedlings presented an earlier leaf senescence in 2015 as compared to 2014, and a later leaf senescence in 2016 as compared to 2015. However, results were more pronounced under scheme A1 and the populations showing the largest response were E1, D2 and D3. Finally, the two provenances (Evros-Drama) showed different plastic response trends for the length of the growing period. The largest plastic response was observed under A1, where the populations from Evros, especially E1 and E4, had a shorter growing period in 2014–2015 than in 2015–2016, while D3 and D4 had a longer one for the same year. In 2016, all populations demonstrated an increased growing period under A1. An opposite trend was observed under irrigation scheme A2, with all populations having a shorter growing period in 2015 and a longer one in 2016 (Figure
