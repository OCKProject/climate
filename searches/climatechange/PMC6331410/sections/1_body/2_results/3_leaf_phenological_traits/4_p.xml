<p class="p">Populations demonstrated significant differences among each other in the duration of the growing period for both irrigation schemes and for all years (Table 
 <xref rid="T6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>). Under less frequent irrigation (scheme A1), populations E1 and E4, contrary to E2 and E3, had the longest vegetation period in 2014, but the shortest in 2015 and 2016. On the contrary, under the same irrigation scheme, populations D3 and D4 had the shortest growing period in 2014, which gradually increased in 2015 and 2016, as compared to D2. Populations belonging to Drama provenance had a longer growing period during all years under frequent irrigation (scheme A2), especially during 2016.
