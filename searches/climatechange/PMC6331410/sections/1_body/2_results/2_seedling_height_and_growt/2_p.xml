<p class="p">Seedling height in the growth chamber was not influenced significantly by population or provenance, according to the HLM model comparison. A significant influence of provenance was detected for height increment between 2015 and 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>), since provenance Drama demonstrated lower height growth than Evros during the same period (Supplement Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">3</xref>). The irrigation scheme was a factor that significantly influenced seedling height in 2015 and growth between 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). A large proportion of the total variance in height and growth traits was explained by the irrigation schemes after the first (6.5%) and even more so after the second year (24.4%), but not after the third year of the study. Provenances and populations explained smaller proportions of the total variance in 2014 (3.0 and 5.0%, respectively), had no effect in 2015 and explained a higher proportion of the phenotypic variance in seedling height in 2016 (6.6 and 9.3%, respectively). Provenance and population had no influence on seedling height increment between 2014–2015 but accounted for a larger fraction of variance in height increment between 2015–2016 (10.1 and 15.0%, respectively) (Figures
