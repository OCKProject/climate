<p class="p">In the growth chamber, seedlings from most populations reached a greater height under longer drought intervals (scheme A1), but this trend was statistically significant only for populations E1 and D3 during the first 2 years of the study (2014 and 2015) and for E3 in the first year (2014) only (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and Supplement Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">3</xref>). All differences between irrigation schemes A1 and A2 observed in 2014 and 2015 disappeared in 2016. Height increment between years 2015–2016 was almost halved in comparison to years 2014–2015 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6A,B</xref>). Significant differences in seedling height among populations were found only under irrigation scheme A2 during years 2014 and 2015 but not in 2016 (Table 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>).
