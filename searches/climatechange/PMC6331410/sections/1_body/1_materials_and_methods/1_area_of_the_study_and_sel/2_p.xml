<p class="p">Two beech provenances were chosen in N.E. Greece, “Evros,” on the eastern side and “Drama” on the western side of the study area (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplement Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">1</xref>). Four populations were selected in each provenance (E1–E4 and D1–D4 respectively), representing different postglacial lineages, based on genetic studies (Hatziskakis et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Papageorgiou et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Due to the absence of long term meteorological data from the area of the selected populations, we used current climatic data available from worldclim.org in a 30-acr seconds resolution (version 1.4) (Hijmans et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Souto et al., 
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Four basic climatic and 19 bioclimatic variables were extracted for the coordinates of each sampled seed parent and the average values were used to describe each population (Supplement Tables

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">3</xref> and Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A,B</xref>). Provenance Evros represents a climatic environment with moist and cold winters, warm and dry summers with an intense (but not long) drought period. The climate in Drama provenance appears to be more continental with relatively moist and more severe winters as well as warm summers with less intense dry periods (Gouvas and Sakellariou,
