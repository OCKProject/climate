<p class="p">Northeastern Greece is a mountainous region, with a topographically diverse landscape covering various altitudes. Mt. Rodopi, a long massif shared between Greece and Bulgaria, dominates this region and extends from the east to the west. In the lowlands, the climate is subhumid and submediterranean, with harsh winters and dry summers, while it becomes more humid and temperate with harsh winters and no summer drought in higher altitudes (Mavromatis, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1980</xref>). Beech forests are present all over this region, covering habitats with a large variety of environmental conditions (Bergmeier and Dimopoulos, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Tsiripidis et al., 
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). According to genetic and ecological studies, beech populations in N.E. Greece have a complex biogeographic background, since they represent multiple postglacial lineages, originating from different glacial refugia (Hatziskakis et al., 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Papageorgiou et al., 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). At the same time, this region is suggested to be part of a possible introgression zone between two beech species
