<p class="p">Acknowledging the universal principle that no true model exists (Box and Draper, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>), we choose not to fit a unique model but instead fit several candidate (nested) models in terms of varying the number of covariates included as predictors, in order to select a final optimal model among these candidates, based on appropriately balancing goodness-of-fit with simplicity and utilizing the appropriate evaluation criterion. We did not opt for stepwise (either forward/backward) elimination methods for variable selection since the latter have been recognized to suffer from significant drawbacks (Hurvich and Tsai, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1990</xref>; Roecker, 
 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1991</xref>). Hence, model fit was assessed by initially fitting the null model (Model 1), which includes only the grand mean as predictor. One new predictor variable is added for each subsequent model. While Model 1 includes only the intercept, Model 2 introduces the factor of the populations and Model 3 adds the component of provenances. Finally, Model 4 additionally includes the factor of irrigation scheme and essentially corresponds to the full model presented in equations (1â€“3). Every next model is compared in terms of fit performance with the previous one. The overall significance of each model is then evaluated through the likelihood ratio statistic (LRT) (based on the likelihood of each model), which acts as a stand-alone measure of goodness-of-fit, as well as through the model comparisons. The LRT is only valid if used to compare hierarchically nested models, as applied in our research. LRT is calculated through the following likelihood ratio statistic:
