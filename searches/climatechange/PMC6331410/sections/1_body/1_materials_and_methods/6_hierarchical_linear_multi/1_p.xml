<p class="p">To assess the effect of provenance, population and irrigation scheme on the dependent variables (all traits used in this study), we utilized a three-level hierarchical linear modeling approach (HLM; Raudenbush and Bryk, 
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>), that considers the nested structure of the data in this study. The implementation of this modeling approach is standard in a variety of disciplines (Afshartous and Wolf, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) with varying terminology depending on discipline (the hierarchical model is also known as the mixed-effects model, the random-coefficient model, and in the context of panel data, the repeated-measures or growth-curve model). A major advantage in this type of model over the standard regression models, is the within group and between groups comparison and the improved accuracy of point estimates in model parameters (e.g., Katahira, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The framework of the model considers

 <italic class="italic">j</italic> = 1, 2). The last level of this nested modeling structure is completed with the inclusion of the two different irrigation schemes (
