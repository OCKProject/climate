<p class="p">Variables “population,” “provenance,” and “irrigation scheme” were the fixed effects in our models, whereas random effects terms were the corresponding errors not explained by the three fixed effects, i.e., 
 <bold class="bold">e</bold>
 <sub class="sub">
  <bold class="bold">ijk</bold>
 </sub>, 
 <bold class="bold">r</bold>
 <sub class="sub">
  <bold class="bold">jk</bold>
 </sub> and 
 <bold class="bold">u</bold>
 <sub class="sub">
  <bold class="bold">k</bold>
 </sub>. For the provenance factors, “Evros” was used as a reference category, while the first population within each provenance was used as a reference category for the population factors. Finally, we have used the irrigation scheme A1 as a reference category of the irrigation scheme.
