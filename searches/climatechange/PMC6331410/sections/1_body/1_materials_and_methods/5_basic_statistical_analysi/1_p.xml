<p class="p">A comparison of means among populations and between provenances, was performed for the variables measured in the seedlings growing in the growth chamber and in the field. Differences in seedling survival among populations were described through a repeated pairwise chi-square test, since survival was scored as a binary variable. The same test was also used to evaluate the differences between the irrigation schemes, separately for each population. Mean differences in seedling height and annual growth were tested for significance using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the LSD criterion, since normal distribution and homoscedasticity of data were proven. This comparison was performed separately for each irrigation scheme and year of the study. Pairwise differences in all phenological traits between populations for each irrigation scheme and year were tested for significance, using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, since normal distribution assumptions were not met. For all comparisons, the software STATISTICA v.10 (STATSOFT inc) was used.</p>
