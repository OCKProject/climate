<p class="p">For each month, the estimated maximum, minimum and mean temperatures, as well as the precipitation data were extracted from the above dataset (CSIRO MK3 CGM) using the DIVA-GIS software (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.diva-gis.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.diva-gis.org</ext-link>) (Supplement Table 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">2</xref>). Using these values, a different temperature schedule (change of daily values at 3-h intervals) for each month was created and applied in the growth chamber. Each separate monthly schedule was stable for all the days of each respective month. Light intensity during the day inside the chamber was set according to 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> observations that took place in the reference location under clear sky. Annual height growth between the experimental years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 was also calculated. Light intensity values inside the chamber were set to a range between 0.010 and 0.025 μmol x s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> following the course of natural daylight. The lengths of day and night for each month were adjusted to those under natural conditions in the reference area.
