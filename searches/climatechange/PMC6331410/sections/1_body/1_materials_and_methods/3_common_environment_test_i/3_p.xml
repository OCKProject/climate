<p class="p">The simulated monthly precipitation height (mm) was converted into water volume (ml) to regulate seedling irrigation, following Brouwer et al. (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1985</xref>). Besides precipitation height, we tested the effect of precipitation distribution within a month on seedlings, especially during the summer period, since climate change is expected to destabilize the current precipitation frequency and intensity and cause longer drought periods, as well as climate extremes in the Eastern Mediterranean region (Alpert et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>; Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>; Lelieveld et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). For this reason, precipitation was distributed within each month according to two different irrigation schemes: 
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Irrigation scheme A1 (non-frequent): irrigation of seedlings every 20 days with the relevant amount of water of the corresponding month (50% of monthly precipitation height when irrigation occurred twice a month, or 100% of monthly precipitation height when irrigation occurred once a month).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Irrigation scheme A2 (frequent): irrigation of seedlings every seven days with 25% of the simulated monthly precipitation height.</p>
