<p class="p">The growth chamber experiment lasted for 3 years (2013–2016). Measurements included seedling height, survival and leaf phenological traits (Madsen,

Seedling height was measured at the end of each growing season from October 2014 until October 2016. Annual height growth between the experimental years 2014–2015 and 2015–2016 was also calculated. Phenology measurements included bud burst (leaf emergence), leaf senescence and duration of the growing period. Both parameters were expressed in number of days. The beginning of bud burst was considered to occur when the bud scales opened in a way that the newly emerged leaves were visible. Individual plants were considered entering the senescence stage when at least 50% of their leaves were discolored (Gömöry et al., 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Measurements of phenological traits were conducted in 3 day–intervals. The plastic response between subsequent experimental years was expressed for all traits as the difference of the annual mean values between these years.
