<p class="p">One seedling per family and per irrigation scheme was included in the experiment. Seedlings representing population D1 were abnormal in a high ratio (66%), producing finally a limited number of viable normal seedlings that were not enough to represent D1 in both irrigation schemes. For this reason, D1 was excluded from the experiment in the growing chamber and the viable normal seedlings from this population were used only in the common garden test under field conditions.</p>
