<p class="p">In March 2013, the surviving containerized normal seedlings of both provenances were put in a growth chamber under simulated temperature and precipitation levels estimated from the CSIRO MK3 CGM model, according to the expected conditions in the year 2050 (downloaded from Climong.org) (Kriticos et al.,

The reference area for the climate simulation in the growth chamber was the location “Agios Georgios” (Drama, Greece) that corresponds to population D4 in this study. Climate change scenario A1 and storyline A1B were selected, with the assumption that the industrial development in the areas of the populations of this study will remain minimal and that there will be a balanced use of all energy sources until 2050 (IPCC,
