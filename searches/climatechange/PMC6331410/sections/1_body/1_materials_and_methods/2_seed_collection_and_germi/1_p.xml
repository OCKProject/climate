<p class="p">Seed collection occurred in autumn 2012, a non-mast production year for beech in the study area, since &lt;50% of the trees produced nuts. In each population, 60–80 seeds per seed tree were collected from 30 trees, totaling 240 families. We consider seeds and later seedlings originating from the same seed tree as a half-sib family. After their transfer to the laboratory, seeds were air-blown to remove the empty ones. The remaining seeds were immersed for 2 min in 35% H

Each dish contained 10 randomly selected seeds per family, totaling 300 seeds per population and 1,200 seeds per provenance. Germination was completed during the stratification stage. Seeds that germinated were transferred to plastic pots filled with turf, sand and perlite in a ratio of 4:2:1, respectively, for further development and evaluation. The emerging seedlings were evaluated as normal or abnormal according to ISTA (
