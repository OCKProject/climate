<p class="p">A common environment provenance test under natural field conditions was set up in Agios Georgios (Drama, Greece), the same location that was used as a reference for the climate simulation in the growth chamber. An area of 100 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> was fenced and a total number of 480 seedlings (two seedlings/family/population) were planted in a natural beech stand with dense crown closure (70â€“80%). Seedlings were planted with the soil substrate of their original pots (4 turf/2 sand/1 perlite). Survival measurements were taken two times per year during the months of October and April for 3 years. The survival percentage at the end of the 3 years experiment was used in this study. This experimental site was established in order to provide a direct comparison of seedling survival between the simulated future conditions applied in the growth chamber and the current natural forest conditions. Due to the absence of meteorological stations in the broader area and the lack of ecological studies for the specific site, the local environmental conditions were not described in detail and they were not monitored throughout the experiment.
