<p class="p">The results of our study reveal the existence of high genetic diversity in adaptive traits in the beech forests of N.E. Greece. These adaptive differences occur at multiple spatial levels, among distant and neighboring populations. There is a clear geographical and environmental trend in adaptation to climate. On the eastern side of the study area (provenance Evros), beech populations are better adapted to dry climatic conditions with longer intervals of drought during the summer and low probability of late frosts in the spring. As a result, seedlings from Evros demonstrate higher survival and earlier bud burst in the first year of the study than seedlings from Drama, under simulated climate change conditions, especially when irrigation is not frequent. At the same time, most of the Evros populations show a specific phenotypic pattern, as a response to the simulated climate change conditions in the growth chamber, with a shortening of the growth period during the second year of the study. Respectively, populations located on the western side of the study area (provenance Drama) seem to demonstrate adaptations to more temperate conditions, characterized mainly by long and cold winters and more humid summers. Seedlings originating from Drama showed lower survival under long drought intervals during the summer in the growth chamber and a late bud burst in the first year, but then shifted their growing season earlier and flushed earlier than the Evros seedlings in the second year of the study.</p>
