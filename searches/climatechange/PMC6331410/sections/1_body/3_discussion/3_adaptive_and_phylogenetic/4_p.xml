<p class="p">Despite the differences in the survival rate between E1 and E4, these two populations demonstrated similarities in their phenological profile, which was much different than E2 and E3 in the Evros provenance. According to a fine scale genetic analysis of chloroplast DNA haplotypes in beech populations in the region (Manolis et al.: unpublished data), both E1 and E4 seem to derive from the postglacial expansion of the same beech population in a local refugium, where beech survived during multiple glacial cycles and probably developed effective adaptive strategies. The origin of a local glacial refugium has been suggested as a possible explanation for late bud burst of the Slovenian beech provenance Idrija-II/2 in European field trials, as a possible adaptation to long cold winters during glaciation (Brus,

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Thus, adaptive differences between distant or close-by populations may derive from selective evolutionary responses to environmental conditions of past refugia, in parallel with the ongoing processes of adaptation to current environmental conditions. This seems to be especially true in the case of disjunct “rear edge” populations of forest trees that have not received any maladaptive gene flow from the core populations of the species and maintain the ability to evolutionary adjust themselves to local climate changes (Fady et al.,
