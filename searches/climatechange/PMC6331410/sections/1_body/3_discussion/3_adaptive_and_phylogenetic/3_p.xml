<p class="p">Adaptive differences were recorded within provenances as well, indicating that beech populations that belong to the same geographic region and are located within a small distance exhibit large genetic differences in adaptive traits. Differences in altitude, aspect and topographical connectivity between populations probably define an environmental mosaic with semi-isolated patches of beech forests, where natural selection can locally cause well-adapted ecotypes that differ at a small spatial scale. In Evros, population E1 was proven to be best adapted to warmer conditions and summers with prolonged periods without rain, as shown by the high survival rate of E1 in the growth chamber, the early bud burst in the first year of the study and the defensive phenological plasticity pattern in the next years. Indeed, E1 shows adaptive differences from the neighboring population E2 (only 682 m apart), probably because the environmental conditions at these sites are critically different. Population E1 is a marginal beech stand located on a south facing slope, while E2 is a dense forest on the north facing slope of the mountain, growing under much more favorable conditions. Furthermore, population E4 showed a different adaptive pattern in seedling survival than E1, which can be attributed to the more oceanic microclimate of the specific location, as explained above.</p>
