<p class="p">Besides the different environmental conditions that may have caused adaptive genetic differentiation between the two provenances of this study, another reason for the differences in adaptive traits that exist between Evros and Drama may be the presence of different levels of a possible admixture between two beech species, 
 <italic class="italic">F. sylvatica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">F. orientalis</italic> that presumably form a contact zone in the southeastern part of Europe (e.g., Paule, 
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Tsiripidis and Athanasiadis, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Papageorgiou et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Govaerts et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). In N.E, Greece, several authors suggest an increasing admixture trend toward the east (Moulopoulos, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1965</xref>; Tsiripidis and Athanasiadis, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Papageorgiou et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Hatziskakis et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), with provenance Evros being genetically and morphologically closer to 
 <italic class="italic">F. orientalis</italic> and provenance Drama to 
 <italic class="italic">F. sylvatica</italic>. Since the former species grows in warmer and drier climates than the latter, adaptive differentiation may exist between them, as suggested by earlier studies (Atalay, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>; Tsiripidis and Athanasiadis, 
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; Papageorgiou et al., 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
