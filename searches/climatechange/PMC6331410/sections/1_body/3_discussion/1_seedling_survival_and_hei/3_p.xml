<p class="p">In the field trial, survival results suggest the existence of a strong local adaptation pattern for beech seedlings, as other researchers also report (see Kreyling et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The highest survival rate was observed for the two populations with a geographical origin closest to the location of the test site (D3 and D4). On the contrary, the more distant populations E1 and E2, that demonstrated the highest survival rates under drought conditions in the growth chamber, had the highest mortality rates under field conditions, in agreement with other beech common garden trials (Banach et al., 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), although the opposite trend has been also reported (e.g., Sułkowska, 
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>; Hofmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Müller and Finkeldey, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). It is worth noting that adaptive differentiation to the colder conditions in the field experiment, as expressed in survival rates, was observed mainly among populations within provenances. Thus, seedlings from the distant Evros populations E3 and E4 survived as well as some populations of the local Drama provenance, indicating that environmental heterogeneity at a smaller geographical scale can create significant adaptive differentiation.
