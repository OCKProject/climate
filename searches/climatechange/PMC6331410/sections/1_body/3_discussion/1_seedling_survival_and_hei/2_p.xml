<p class="p">Seedlings from Evros provenance generally presented higher survival in the growth chamber, under drought conditions, indicating a possible adaptation to prolonged drought intervals, since summer drought in Evros lasts longer and temperatures are generally higher than in Drama. Among the Evros populations, E4 presented significantly lower seedling survival under less frequent irrigation, indicating sensitivity to longer periods without rain. Indeed, population E4 is located in an area covered with beech forests characterized as an “island” of oceanic climate. This is emphasized by the frequent occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">Galium rotundifolium</italic>, a plant species acting as good indicator of oceanic climate (Ellenberg et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>), which is absent in the Rodopi mountains, besides the area surrounding population E4. High variability in seedling survival and its response to irrigation frequency was also observed among populations within the Drama provenance, a possible indication of local adaptation of beech to the different microenvironments of each population.
