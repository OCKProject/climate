<p class="p">Seedling mortality in the growth chamber, for all populations and provenances, was observed exclusively during the first year of the experiment. In the environment of the growth chamber, irrigation frequency proved to be an important factor for seedling survival, since mortality increased when irrigation occurred after long intervals of drought (A1 scheme). In the field, the decisive factor for seedling survival proved to be the exposure to winter conditions. Frost events were not simulated in the growth chamber and seedlings survived better in the growth chamber than in the field, probably for this reason. This trend, where the largest differences in survival among populations occur when conditions are unfavorable, is common in provenance tests for beech (e.g., Banach et al.,
