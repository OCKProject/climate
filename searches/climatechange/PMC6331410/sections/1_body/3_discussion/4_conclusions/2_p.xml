<p class="p">Despite the existence of adaptive diversity among the populations of beech in N.E. Greece, the survival of beech and other temperate forest tree species in the future remains unknown, since the speed, the uniformity and the intensity of climate change are different in different climate models. We expect severe climate fluctuation in the near future, with an increased intensity in the forests of the Mediterranean ecoregion being most at risk. Beech populations in the rear edge of the distribution of the species have a large adaptive potential and their persistence seems to be of major importance for forests and forestry all over Europe, pressing for an adjustment of forest management and conservation policies (Mátyás et al.,
