<p class="p">Our findings reveal two different foliar phenology patterns followed by beech seedlings in this study. These patterns seem to depend on provenance and differ mainly in bud burst timing in spring and less significantly in the timing of leaf senescence in autumn. Seedlings from Evros provenance showed a delay in bud burst in 2015 and 2016 in respect to 2014. This pattern is apparent under both irrigation schemes, however it is more evident under A1, suggesting that Evros provenance is better adapted to prolonged intervals between irrigation events. On the other hand, populations of Drama showed earlier budburst in the respective years under both schemes. These observations reveal a different foliar phenology pattern, where beech populations initiate their growing period sooner in order to maximize total carbon gain, as it seems to be more prone to higher temperatures during summer, under non-frequent irrigation (scheme A1). Most reports from field provenance trials for beech show that, unlike in our study, bud burst timing remains constant and the order of provenances in this regard remains unchanged during years, without a strong interaction between provenance and test site (Robson et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). We assume that stressful environmental conditions, such as the ones simulated in the growth chamber in our study, may trigger certain physiological responses that will allow trees to survive. Since phenological traits are complex in nature and in their underlying mechanisms (Vitasse et al., 
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Fu et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Basler and KÃ¶rner, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), further studies of provenances and families of trees utilizing functional and anatomical traits are needed to understand these adaptation strategies better.
