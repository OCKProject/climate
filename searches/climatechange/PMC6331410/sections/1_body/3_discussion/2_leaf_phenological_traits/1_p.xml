<p class="p">In our experiment, the two irrigation frequency schemes produced different leaf phenological responses at all traits during the first 2 years of the study. In the third year, the differences in leaf phenological traits were influenced mainly by provenance and population. Considering the adaptive significance of the timing of bud burst and leaf senescence, which define the length of the growing period, we assume that seedlings probably needed a certain period of time until they were able to physiologically adapt to the growth chamber conditions and irrigation schemes. The results of our study imply that the duration of the growing period in beech seedlings was mostly determined by the timing of bud burst, while the differences between populations, provenances, and irrigation schemes in leaf senescence were less pronounced. Bud burst occurred earlier and leaves matured later under frequent irrigation (scheme A2) especially during the first years of the study, a trend that was consistent for all populations. Thus, the existence of longer drought intervals between irrigation events (scheme A1) has shortened the growing period of plants in the chamber, an expected response to stressful conditions.</p>
