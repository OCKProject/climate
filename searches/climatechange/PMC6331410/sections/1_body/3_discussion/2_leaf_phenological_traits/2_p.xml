<p class="p">Bud burst is considered to be under strong genetic control (Dittmar and Elling,

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Müller et al., 
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) and provenances often show adaptive differences in this trait in common environment experiments, that correspond to specific environmental conditions at the sites of origin (von Wühlisch et al., 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>; Schüler et al., 
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kramer et al., 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Provenance tests all over the continent describe a general trend of populations growing in warmer and less continental climates to have an earlier bud burst than populations from colder climates (Robson et al., 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Extrapolating this trend to the provenances and populations of our study, we would expect provenance Evros to have an earlier bud burst than Drama. While this was indeed the case in the first year of the study in the growth chamber, the phenological trend reversed during the next 2 years. Thus, in the first year of the growth chamber experiment, provenance Evros had an earlier bud burst and a longer growing period than Drama, while in the next years, bud burst had shifted to a later date for Evros and to an earlier date for Drama. These findings show that provenances initially demonstrated the expected genetic response matching the environmental conditions at their sites of origin, with Drama having a cooler and more temperate climate than Evros. However, the projected conditions of 2050 under climate change applied in the growth chamber, probably stimulated a differentiated plastic reaction for both provenances. We assume that the same environmental signals that trigger bud flush in plants, such as temperature and humidity, had a different effect on the provenances in this study. Indeed, in a temperature manipulation experiment, Fu et al. (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) report that artificial warming of beech seedlings significantly affected bud burst date in different provenances.
