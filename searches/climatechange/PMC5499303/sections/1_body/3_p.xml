<p class="p">It is possible that when one plant–pollinator interaction is lost through a spatial or temporal mismatch, a new interaction will take its place. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alarcón et al. (2008)</xref> found that a plant–pollinator network changed its topology year-by-year due to changes in climate, as well as other factors. Similarly, novel interactions accounted for almost half of the interactions remaining in sites resampled more than a century later by 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkle et al. (2013)</xref>; however, these novel interactions can entail reduced pollinator fidelity and effectiveness (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkle et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, data on fitness components such as pollen deposition and seed set may be needed to determine the plant reproductive consequences of novel interactions and potential mismatches.
