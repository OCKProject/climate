<p class="p">Given that climate change often takes many years to have detectable effects upon the phenologies and distributions of populations, experimental transplants offer a relatively rapid and controlled approach to further our understanding of how plantâ€“pollinator interactions will fare. However, experimental shifts do not allow time for adaptive evolution, as shifted populations do not have multiple generations to respond to gradually changing conditions. Experimental shifts in phenology or distribution may therefore predict more severe effects upon plants, pollinators, and their interactions than would occur under a real climatic change. Nevertheless, these manipulations can reveal how selection pressures could change under future climate conditions.</p>
