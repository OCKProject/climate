<p class="p">To understand and anticipate how climate change will affect plant–pollinator interactions, spatial and temporal transplants are valuable and underused approaches. So far, few studies have used transplants to examine how these interactions will be affected, and fewer still have focused on the effects of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Yet, experimental manipulations of phenology and distribution can provide ecological and evolutionary insight into the current and future effects of climate change on plant–pollinator interactions by generating novel contexts in which the responses of populations and individuals can be measured. These manipulations can be used to test for local adaptation and plasticity to changing conditions, which will inform researchers about persistence of populations and interactions under climate change. Moving populations outside of their current ranges in space and time provides a way to test how populations will fare in novel niche space, allowing a more predictive understanding of climate change effects. Models of range dynamics cannot anticipate how novel interactions or interactions in novel climates will shape species’ distributions; experiments are first required to determine the outcomes of such interactions (
