<p class="p">Despite drawbacks, experimental transplants provide a way to empirically test how plantâ€“pollinator interactions will be reshaped in novel environments and communities. General characteristics anticipated to influence how likely mutualisms are to develop mismatches, such as the specialization, obligacy, and seasonality of the interaction (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rafferty et al., 2015</xref>), could be tested by transplanting plants or pollinators that span the spectrum of these traits. Indeed, if several species in a community are studied, responses of transplanted plants and pollinators could be linked to functional traits, yielding more mechanistic information that can be used to predict the responses of additional species. The use of experimental transplants that explicitly consider shifts in both time and space should generate unique insight into the likelihood that plant and pollinator populations will adapt to a changing climate.
