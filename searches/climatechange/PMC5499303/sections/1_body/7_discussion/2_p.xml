<p class="p">For both spatial and temporal transplants, the use of historical data to inform experimental manipulations can be beneficial. Historical data can provide a preâ€“climate change baseline of phenology or range for comparison with observed and projected shifts (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rafferty et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pyke et al., 2016</xref>). In combination with contemporary data, historical data can be used to determine the rate of phenological or distributional response to climate change (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fitter and Fitter, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parmesan and Yohe, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bartomeus et al., 2011</xref>). This rate can be used to project the amount of time or the number of generations required for populations to shift into novel ranges or phenologies under further climate change.
