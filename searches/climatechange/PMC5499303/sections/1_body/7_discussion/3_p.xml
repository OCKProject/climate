<p class="p">In choosing taxa to manipulate, knowledge about the mechanisms underlying shifts in space or time is beneficial, both in ensuring that study designs have relevance and realism and that manipulations are feasible. Thus, understanding of phenological cues and triggers for focal species is useful, as is a recognition that historical correlations among cues could be altered by climate change (

Generation time of study taxa is another important consideration, especially if evolutionary responses are of interest or controlled genetic crosses are important. Likewise, choice of study area is a critical but often constrained decision. Environmental gradients can vary from coarse to fine in the same space depending on what abiotic variables and taxonomic perspectives are of interest. Temporal responses and trends can be confounded with spatial characteristics, making it important to consider placement of spatial transplant plots carefully (
