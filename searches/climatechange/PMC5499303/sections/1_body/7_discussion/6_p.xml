<p class="p">As noted, we are not aware of any studies that experimentally manipulate the phenologies of pollinators, but such work would provide important insight. Could earlier emergence times increase the risk of exposure to extreme cold and its associated impacts to survival and reproduction, in much the way that shifting plants earlier can increase their risk of frost damage? The responses of pollinators to climate warming may be more complex than a simple phenological advance, however. For example, diapause termination may be delayed by warmer winter temperatures, which may mitigate the effects of spring and summer warming on emergence time (
