<p class="p">Combining the study of spatial and temporal shifts should be especially useful, as many populations are responding across both axes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, the rates and directions of response may differ on each axis. For plantâ€“pollinator interactions, the sessile nature of one partner and the mobile nature of the other means that partners are likely to respond at different rates in both space and time, so it is important to study the effects of changes in both dimensions. In addition, spatial transplants often affect phenology due to altered abiotic conditions (e.g.,
