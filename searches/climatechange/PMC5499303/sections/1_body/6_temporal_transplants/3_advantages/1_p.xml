<p class="p">A merit of some experimental manipulations of phenology is that they can isolate the effects of phenology from other cues or confounding variables in the environment that would accompany spatial transplants. This can be achieved by altering phenology in a greenhouse before placing plants out in the field. Because plant or pollinator communities may be adapted for persistence at certain times of the year, approaches that manipulate phenology independently of other factors can provide information on how timing alone might influence patterns of pollen movement among conspecifics and heterospecifics, as well as competition and facilitation among coflowering species for pollinator visitation. Studying pollinator visitation may reveal if plants flowering at their “local” time are more likely to be visited than plants flowering earlier or later than usual. Controlling for plant density, adaptation and pre-adaptation to temporal niches can be tested for in this way.</p>
