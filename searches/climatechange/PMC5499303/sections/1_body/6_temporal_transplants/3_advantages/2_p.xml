<p class="p">Experimental shifts can be used to create phenological “mutants,” whose timing of developmental events occurs outside the current range (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gezon et al., 2016</xref>). These “mutants” have great utility for studying how future changes in phenology may affect plant–pollinator interactions, as plants and pollinators will likely undergo greater phenological shifts as climate change continues. Plants with experimentally advanced flowering could be used to detect pollinator availability at novel times, although as 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest (2015)</xref> points out, it is possible to fail to observe pollinators at experimental plants even though they are active elsewhere in the environment. Nevertheless, by shifting plants or pollinators forward in time, we can gain a more predictive understanding of whether plants and pollinators will be buffered by interaction network rewiring (
