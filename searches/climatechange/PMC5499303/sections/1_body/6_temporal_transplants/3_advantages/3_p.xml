<p class="p">The reasons for current shifts in phenology in response to climate change can also be determined using temporal transplants. Changing different abiotic conditions such as precipitation and carbon dioxide levels may differentially affect phenology (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cleland et al., 2007</xref>), and this may indicate which factors are the most important drivers of phenological shifts in response to climate change. In addition, such experiments can test how plastic plants or pollinators are in their phenological responses. Mechanistic understanding can then inform the experimental methods used to manipulate phenology of focal species.
