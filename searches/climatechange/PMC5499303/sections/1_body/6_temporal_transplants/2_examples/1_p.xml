 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rafferty and Ives (2011)</xref> compared current and historical dates of first bloom (DFB) for 14 plants of southern Wisconsin. They found that six of these were “historically advanced”; their DFBs had advanced 6–13 days since the historical observations were made. The others were “historically unchanged”; their modern DFBs were not significantly different from the historical data. The phenologies of these 14 species were then experimentally manipulated in a greenhouse to be advanced or delayed by increasing or decreasing (respectively) the temperature and lighting. Nectar quantity and sucrose content were measured in the plants before they were placed out into the field in arrays of potted plants. Focal observations of pollinator visitation were made, and it was found that changes in visitation differed among species. However, historically advanced species had higher visitation when flowering was advanced, perhaps suggesting pre-adaptation to earlier flowering times, while historically unchanged species had lower visitation when advanced, suggesting local adaptation to historical flowering times. Overall, these results suggest that plant–pollinator mismatches are not occurring in these species, possibly due to species tracking each other or the involvement of novel pollinators.
