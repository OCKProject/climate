They planted the seeds for the advanced-flowering treatment in early March and raised them under artificial long-day conditions, while the control plants were sown in mid-April and grown without supplemental heating or additional light. The advanced-flowering plants were established in the field in late April, and the control plants were established in late May, shortly before flowering. Pollinator visitation was observed in the plants over the flowering period. Visitation by wild bees and hoverflies was lower in the advanced-flowering plants. However, plants were successfully pollinated before the natural flowering time, mostly by generalist pollinators as few of the original pollinators were present, perhaps indicating pre-adaptation. There was increased reproductive output in earlier-flowering plants, possibly due to avoidance of herbivores or unfavorable weather conditions.
