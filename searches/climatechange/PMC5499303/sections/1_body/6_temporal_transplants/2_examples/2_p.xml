<p class="p">Snow removal was used by 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gezon et al. (2016)</xref> to manipulate the flowering phenology of 
 <italic class="italic">Claytonia lanceolata</italic> Pursh (Montiaceae), a spring-flowering forb. The number of plants in flower and the number of open flowers per plant were recorded every other day to determine phenology, and floral morphology, water potential, pollinator visitation, and seed and fruit set were also recorded. It was found that frost damage was more frequent in the plants with advanced phenology, and that this significantly reduced reproduction of the plants even with supplemental pollen. Plants that escaped frost damage had higher reproduction than control plants and also received more visits from pollinators. To control for effects of snow removal on water availability, a second experiment was carried out, with the flowering of plants being shifted using a greenhouse to create early-flowering, control, and late-flowering plants. The plants were then moved to an outdoor array and observed similarly to the plants in the initial experiment. There was no difference between pollinator visitation to the early and control plants, but visitation was much reduced in the late-phenology plants. This may have been due to a mismatch with the plantsâ€™ pollinators, suggesting local adaptation. Together, these results show that both abiotic conditions and phenological overlap with pollinators are important for plant fitness.
