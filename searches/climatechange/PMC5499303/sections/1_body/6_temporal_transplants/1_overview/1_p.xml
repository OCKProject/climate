<p class="p">Temporal transplants (
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest, 2015</xref>) involve experimental manipulation of plants or pollinators to change their phenology. Most experiments are performed on plants as they are relatively easy to manipulate, by removing snow to simulate conditions associated with a changing climate (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gezon et al., 2016</xref>), growing plants in open-top chambers that elevate temperature (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gezon et al., 2016</xref>). In the latter case, once experimental shifting has been carried out, the plants are placed into the field. Various aspects of plant performance, as well as interactions with pollinators (and other community members), can be measured and observed for experimental plants. For example, seed set of shifted plants can be compared to that of controls to see if changes in phenology confer a potential fitness advantage or are disadvantageous (

In this way, insight into the evolutionary consequences of phenological shifts can be gained, as response traits measured for experimental plants or pollinators can indicate not only potential fitness consequences but also how phenotypically plastic genotypes are. Like spatial transplants, temporal transplants can therefore be used to test for local adaptation, phenotypic plasticity, and pre-adaptation to novel niche space in the temporal axis.
