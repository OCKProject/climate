<p class="p">Ancillary traits, such as nectar levels, plant height, and floral odor, may be affected by the treatments used to shift the phenology of plants. For example, changes in light levels affect nectar production (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boose, 1997</xref>), and increasing temperature can increase plant height and aboveground productivity (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rustad et al., 2001</xref>). Changes in these and other traits may affect pollinator visitation (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aspi et al., 2003</xref>) and may not reflect the true effects of climate change on plant traits, as the changes in these traits may be an artifact of the shifting treatment.
