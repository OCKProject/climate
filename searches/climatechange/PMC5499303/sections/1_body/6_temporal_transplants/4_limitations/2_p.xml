<p class="p">As far as we are aware, no studies have been carried out involving experimental phenological shifts in pollinators. This means that studies are generally one-sided, with only the plants being shifted. Studies into the effects of changing pollinator phenology could be carried out by snow removal/addition on overwintering nests (

It may be more feasible to manipulate the phenologies of entire colonies of pollinators, using overwintering queen bumble bees in nest boxes, for example, and test if metrics of colony success are explained by weather variables, rather than to mark and/or track individual pollinators such that their emergence dates and fates could be documented.
