<p class="p">One drawback of temporal transplants is the small size of experimental populations of plants and/or pollinators and the small spatial scale of experimental arrays (

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest, 2015</xref>). For studies that aim to measure the effects of shifts in flowering onset (vs. peak flowering, for example), the small scale of temporal transplants might be less of an issue. This is because, at least for plant populations with normally distributed (or left-skewed) flowering curves, relatively few individuals flower initially. Additionally, if density is controlled for among treatment groups, results from such experiments could be interpreted in the context of the joint effects of phenological shifts and fragmentation of plant populations or declines in pollinator populations, both of which could lead to small populations in microclimates that produce aberrant phenologies.
