<p class="p">Equally, if there are mismatches between the spatial shifts of plants and their pollinators (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>), similar consequences could arise. As climate change occurs, the conditions at previously favorable sites may change, becoming less favorable for plants growing there. If plants are unable to migrate quickly enough to track shifting environmental conditions, they may fail to adapt to rapid changes in their surroundings (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jump and Peñuelas, 2005</xref>). In addition, pollinators might shift their distributions in response to changing climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pyke et al., 2016</xref>) at a faster rate than plants, potentially leaving plants at trailing edges with reduced visitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>). However, to date, spatial mismatches between plants and pollinators have not been observed (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hegland et al., 2009</xref>). Simulations suggest that plant–pollinator interaction network structure can be maintained under pollinator range shifts, assuming that all visitors, regardless of identity or interaction frequency, are equivalent pollinators, that no new interactions arise, and that species lacking interactions go extinct (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Devoto et al., 2007</xref>). Although extinctions of both plants and pollinators occurred in the simulations, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Devoto et al. (2007)</xref> attribute structural robustness to generalists and to nestedness. Of course, plant range limits may not be determined by interactions with pollinators, particularly if plants are autogamous (
