<p class="p">If phenological changes in plants and pollinators occur in parallel, the degree of synchronization between flowering and pollinator activity should be maintained, although pollination might occur earlier or later than it did prior to anthropogenic climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, if one species shifts more than the other or in the opposite direction, these changes in phenology could lead to mismatches between the timing of events such as flowering and pollinator emergence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). These mismatches could have significant detrimental effects upon the fitness of both the plants and pollinators, as the reduction in plant–pollinator interactions could lead to pollination depression in the plant or to pollinator starvation (
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Memmott et al., 2007</xref>). Using a simulation, 
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Memmott et al. (2007)</xref> found that between 17–50% of all pollinator species experienced a reduction in floral resources due to phenological mismatch, while 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkle et al. (2013)</xref> found that phenological shifts explained 14–44% of the plant–pollinator mismatches detected by resampling sites that had been studied 120 years earlier. Two bee-pollinated plant species flowering earlier than usual in a warm spring had reduced seed set compared to cooler years, suggesting asynchrony between bee emergence and flowering phenology with warming (
 <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kudo et al., 2004</xref>), and longer-term study of one of the two species further indicated a phenological mismatch (
