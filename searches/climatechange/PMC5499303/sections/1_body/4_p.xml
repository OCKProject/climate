<p class="p">Given that almost 88% of all plant species (

 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Klein et al., 2007</xref>) depend on pollination by animals, plant–pollinator interactions form an important component of ecological communities and provide a critical ecosystem service. Thus, powerful experimental approaches are needed to study the consequences of climate change–induced shifts in phenology and distribution, both for plants themselves and for their interactions with pollinators. This review considers the utility of experimental transplants for studying the effects of climate change–induced shifts on plants and pollinators and their interactions. We discuss the key insights gained from both approaches, as well as the challenges and drawbacks of each method.
