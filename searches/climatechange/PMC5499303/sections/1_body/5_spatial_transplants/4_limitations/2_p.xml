<p class="p">Spatial transplant experiments can require multiple years to establish. This is particularly true if perennial plants with slow life histories are used, multigeneration responses (e.g., recruitment, population dynamics) are of interest, or interannual environmental variation is significant. Maternal effects need to be considered, either by explicit study or by reducing their influence (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderson and Gezon, 2015</xref>), but controlled crosses and the creation of inbred lines may be impractical for some long-lived perennials. Similarly, studies of the effects of range shifts on interactions with pollinators may require long study periods, as plants must reach maturity if they are transplanted as seeds or seedlings. An alternative would be to create experimental arrays of mature plants in pots or cut flower stems at each “transplant” site (e.g.,

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogilvie and Thomson, 2016</xref>), although measures of fitness or other traits could be influenced by potting, and interaction frequencies could be affected by the potting and cutting treatments.
