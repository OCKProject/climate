<p class="p">When manipulating the distribution of plants or pollinators, the abiotic cues and environmental conditions that influence phenology are likely to be altered. Depending on the goal, the effects of spatial manipulation on phenology may not be a drawback but should be considered nonetheless (e.g.,

For instance, it may not be possible to isolate the effects of temperature on pollination success of plants transplanted from low to high elevation if the plants also flower for a much shorter time at high elevation, narrowing the window of time in which they could be pollinated.
