<p class="p">Because spatial transplants often involve relatively small population sizes and study areas, issues of scale can arise. If small numbers of plants are transplanted, low density can negatively influence pollinator visitation and seed set (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dauber et al., 2010</xref>). Such effects might be a deliberate aspect of the study if the goal is to study colonization of new areas under climate changeâ€“driven range shifts, as founding or leading-edge populations might be small. Nevertheless, in studies designed to test for local adaptation, consideration of how a small population size might influence response variables that rely on mate availability and interaction frequency is important. Similarly, it is usually feasible to transplant only a small number of species, rather than entire communities (but see 
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alexander et al., 2015</xref>). This means that transplants can fail to accurately capture the novel communities that are likely to result from range shifts under climate change.
