<p class="p">Another difficulty with spatial transplants is that they are often more feasible for plants than for pollinators, leading to taxonomic bias (but see 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest and Thomson, 2011</xref>). Even if mobile organisms, such as pollinators, can be transplanted, their mobility means it is challenging to maintain control of their locations, at least on smaller spatial scales. This limitation is irrelevant for studies of emergence or hatching phenology (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest and Thomson, 2011</xref>) but would be important for experiments that seek to study foraging, interactions with plants, or colony or nesting success. Large-scale transplants that exceed the flight ranges of the focal pollinators could be used to limit movement to within the transplant site, but the pollinators may not take to the new site, and such transplants are difficult for logistical, legal, and ethical reasons.
