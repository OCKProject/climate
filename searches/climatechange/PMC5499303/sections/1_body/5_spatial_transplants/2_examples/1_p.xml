 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gómez et al. (2009)</xref> suggested that populations of pollinator-generalist plants found in “evolutionary hotspots” (where pollinator-mediated selection is strong) would have phenotypes more attractive to pollinators than plant populations in “evolutionary coldspots” (with weak pollinator-mediated selective regimes). They performed reciprocal transplants on 
 <italic class="italic">Erysimum mediohispanicum</italic> Polatschek (Brassicaceae) plants from hotspots and coldspots and compared the attractiveness of the plants to pollinators. They found that hotspot plants were more attractive than coldspot plants, suggesting local adaptation for hotspot plants, but maladaptation in the coldspot plants. The plants from the hotspots have an advantage over the coldspot plants; they are both locally adapted to the hotspots and appear to have pre-adaptations for persistence in novel conditions, providing the pollinators remain the same in the new environment. This shows that local adaptation can occur in systems involving generalist interactions, and even on a very small spatial scale (with different sites only hundreds of meters apart). In the context of climate change, this could mean that maladapted populations from evolutionary coldspots would be unlikely to persist if plants from hotspots migrated into their environment, as the hotspot plants may outcompete them for pollinators. Similarly, if coldspot plants track climate change into areas with hotspot plants, they are less likely to persist than the locally adapted hotspot plants.
