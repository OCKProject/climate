 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest and Thomson (2011)</xref> carried out reciprocal transplants of solitary bees and wasps over an elevational gradient, exchanging trap nests at high and low elevations in late summer to allow the insects to experience overwintering and springtime conditions at the new sites. This experiment revealed that local adaptation to site of origin did not affect emergence times. Instead, local conditions at the emergence sites explained differences in emergence times, with insects at the high-elevation site emerging on average 18.2 days later than those at the low-elevation site. The lack of local adaptation suggests the pollinators are plastic in their emergence phenology, which might enable them to maintain consistent overlap with floral resources under climate change. The authors combined their transplant results with observational data on flowering phenology at each site and temperature data to develop models to predict the phenologies of emergence and flowering based on degree-days. Because some pollinators were found to need higher base temperatures to trigger emergence, these results revealed the possibility of temporal mismatches between plants and pollinators occurring in the future, with an increased possibility of plants flowering before pollinators are available. Such a mismatch could reduce pollinator visitation to early flowering species, but is unlikely to result in complete loss of overlap between flowers and trap-nesting pollinators.
