 <italic class="italic">Mimulus guttatus</italic> DC. (Phrymaceae) seeds into serpentine and nonserpentine soils to determine the effects of soil type on floral morphology and display size. The results of this common garden experiment showed that plants were phenotypically plastic: regardless of which soil type they originated in, plants of both populations had smaller floral displays when grown in serpentine soil. The authors also created arrays of inflorescences grown in serpentine and nonserpentine soils. They found that pollinators visited inflorescences at the nonserpentine sites more frequently than those at serpentine sites, but that there was no significant effect of source population soil type on pollinator visitation. The pollinator assemblages differed at the serpentine and nonserpentine sites, with a higher percentage of large bees and beetles observed on the inflorescences at the nonserpentine sites compared to the serpentine sites. If plant populations move to track changing climactic conditions, they may colonize different soil types than those at their historical sites. If populations are adapted to a soil type, they may be unable to persist in novel soil conditions; however, if they are phenotypically plastic, they may be able to persist despite the differing environment. Because pollinator assemblages may vary across a landscape, the migration of a plant population to a new environment to track climate change may alter plantâ€“pollinator interactions and, similarly, pollinators shifting across a landscape with varying soil types or another mosaic of differing abiotic environments may encounter different assemblages of plants and/or differing plant phenotypes within the same species.
