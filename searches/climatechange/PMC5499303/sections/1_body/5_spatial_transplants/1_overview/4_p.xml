<p class="p">Second, individuals with pre-adaptations to different environmental conditions may be more likely to survive under climate change. For example, it may be that pre-adapted individuals from the warmer part of a species’ range will aid the adaptation of a population to rising temperatures associated with climate change (

A transplant experiment could be used to identify these pre-adapted individuals, as their fitness at sites to which they are pre-adapted will be higher than the null expectation (i.e., reduced fitness at the transplant site in comparison to the site of origin).
