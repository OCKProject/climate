<p class="p">Plants or pollinators can be moved within their current ranges or beyond, and their fitness and interspecific interactions at different sites measured. To perform reciprocal transplants, individuals from sites across an elevational or latitudinal gradient are reared in common gardens at each study site. In this way, the fitness of individuals in novel environments can be determined, which will in turn demonstrate whether populations have the traits or plasticity required for persistence in novel conditions, or whether evolution would be required for persistence outside of their current range. For example, if the mean fitness of transplanted individuals is significantly lower beyond vs. within their home range, then this suggests that genetic change would be required for population persistence. Such inference could be strengthened by the use of demographic models, such as integral projection models, to determine how the performance of individuals will influence population dynamics (

Plasticity and standing variation can also be measured for many different traits, allowing various aspects of within-generation plant response to climate change to be considered. In addition to reciprocal spatial transplants along existing environmental gradients, individuals can be exposed to common conditions that simulate future conditions and their fitness measured and/or interactions studied. Such an approach could use environmental chambers, greenhouses, or larger-scale manipulations of carbon dioxide, temperature, and/or soil moisture (e.g., free air carbon dioxide enrichment facilities). Species invasions and colonizations, as well as assisted migrations, could also be viewed as spatial transplants, although low replication or lack of controls present challenges.
