<p class="p">Third, populations that experience multiple environments with differing biotic and abiotic conditions during their life cycles may be more likely to be phenotypically plastic, as will populations in which the progeny experience environments that differ from those experienced by parents (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nicotra et al., 2010</xref>), allowing the population to persist for long enough for adaptive evolution to occur (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forrest and Miller-Rushing, 2010</xref>). Plasticity may also allow populations to remain in their pre–climate change ranges despite novel conditions, allowing the persistence of plant–pollinator interactions, which may have otherwise been disrupted. This could be particularly important for populations with limited dispersal capacity (
