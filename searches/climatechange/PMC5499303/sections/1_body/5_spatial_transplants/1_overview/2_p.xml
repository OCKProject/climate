<p class="p">Spatial transplants can be used to recognize: (i) locally adapted genotypes, which in their site of origin are more highly adapted to the local conditions than genotypes transplanted from other sites (
 <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoban et al., 2016</xref>); (ii) genotypes with “pre-adaptations,” traits that are suited to other environmental conditions such as higher temperatures; and (iii) genotypes with high levels of phenotypic plasticity, allowing them to persist in novel environments or to survive under changing conditions (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderson and Gezon, 2015</xref>). It is important to identify these three (nonmutually exclusive) characteristics of plants and pollinators, as both plastic and evolutionary responses can influence persistence under climate change, and plasticity itself can be selected for (
