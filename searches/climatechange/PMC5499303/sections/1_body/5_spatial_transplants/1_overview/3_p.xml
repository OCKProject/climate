<p class="p">First, local adaptation can influence persistence in changing conditions as the fitness of locally adapted genotypes may be reduced when conditions change (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franks et al., 2014</xref>). This may influence migration rates of populations, because locally adapted genotypes are likely to shift with their climate optimum. However, if migration is constrained by poor dispersal or habitat fragmentation, local adaptation may increase the risk of extinction as the climate optimum shifts away from the species’ range (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jump and Peñuelas, 2005</xref>). On the other hand, local adaptation indicates that populations possessed adequate genetic variation to enable adaptation in the past, which could signify that they will be able to adapt to changing climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franks et al., 2014</xref>). It is also worth noting that factors other than climate, including photoperiod, soil characteristics, and interspecific interactions, could drive local adaptation and affect population colonization of, and persistence in, novel environments (
