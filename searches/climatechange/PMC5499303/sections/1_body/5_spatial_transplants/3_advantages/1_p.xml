<p class="p">By placing individuals in novel climates, spatial transplant experiments can test how plants and pollinators will respond to changing abiotic conditions and how this in turn might alter traits that influence interactions. Thus, with the appropriate controls, transplants into areas that represent likely future climate conditions can enable researchers to test for local adaptation, pre-adaptation, and plasticity. Spatial transplants can provide information that can also be used to test predictions of species distribution models that are based on observational correlational data (
