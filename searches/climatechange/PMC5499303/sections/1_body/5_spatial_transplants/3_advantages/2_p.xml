<p class="p">Another advantage of spatial transplants is that they allow researchers to create novel communities of species that are likely to co-occur under future climate conditions. Once individuals are transplanted, it is likely that the ranges of plants and pollinators will intersect in novel ways, providing an opportunity to study the ability of species to integrate into changing interaction networks, with novel pollinators or plants. Changes in interaction strength, partner identity, and effectiveness can be studied. Although the occurrence of novel interactions can be predicted based on an understanding of traits that shape plantâ€“pollinator interactions, such as flower and tongue length matching (
