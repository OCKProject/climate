<p class="p">Climate change is affecting the phenology and distribution of plants and animals, potentially altering demography, species interactions, and ecosystem processes (

 <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Walther, 2010</xref>). Of particular interest have been the effects of climate warming upon plants, pollinators, and their interactions via changes in phenology and range (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hegland et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Many plants are flowering significantly earlier than in the past, although some first flowering dates have not changed or have shifted to later dates (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">CaraDonna et al., 2014</xref>). There are fewer long-term records of pollinator phenology, but some butterfly species now appear earlier in the year than they did previously (

 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Forister and Shapiro, 2003</xref>) and several wild bee species have undergone a climate-associated shift, becoming active earlier in the season (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bartomeus et al., 2011</xref>), whereas the phenology of syrphid flies has not shifted significantly over two recent decades (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iler et al., 2013</xref>). At the same time, increasing evidence indicates that both plants and animals have shifted their distributions in response to climate change, by moving toward the poles and/or to higher elevations (
