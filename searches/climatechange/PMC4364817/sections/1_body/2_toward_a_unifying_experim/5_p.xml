<p class="p">The IPCC (
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) concluded that during the course of this century, the ability of many organisms and ecosystems to adapt naturally is likely to be surpassed by an unprecedented rate of climate change, an unprecedented combination of changes in climate, associated extreme events, and anthropogenic influences such as pollution, eutrophication, overexploitation, land use, and other disturbances. As a consequence, nearly 20–30% of biodiversity are at increasing risk of extinction as global mean temperatures increase by 2 to 3°C above preindustrial levels. Our proposal is that a solid and mechanistic foundation is required for developing projections of probable outcomes under climate change (Estay et al. 
 <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>; Pörtner et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Development of unifying concepts such as OCLTT is relevant for interpreting existing and future findings in a coherent way and for projecting the future ecological and evolutionary effects of climate change on whole-organism and ecosystem functioning (Bozinovic et al.
