<p class="p">An important shortcoming of previous approaches has been that experimental laboratory and field studies mostly tested one variable at a time. Additive or synergistic effects of various drivers, however, have occurred under climate change in the past and also characterize ongoing climate change (Pörtner et al. 
 <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), for example, in the ocean (e.g., Boyd and Hutchins 
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Pörtner 
 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Pörtner et al. 
 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). OCLTT illustrates a new way how to integrate different drivers and traits (Pörtner 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) or how to parameterize fundamental traits for the modeling of functional limits, diseases, species abundances, biogeographical range. Increased variability and frequency of extreme events under climate change require consideration (Rahmstorf and Coumou 
 <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Studies in thermal biology have often focused on the impact of shifting mean values on organisms but temperature variability may also act as a selective force (Pörtner and Knust 
 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Bozinovic et al. 
 <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013a</xref>; Clavijo-Baquet et al. 
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The development of a widely accepted theoretical basis should relate physiology to population processes and address the role of temperature means and variability at higher ecological levels and their potentially nonadditive interaction shaping performance.
