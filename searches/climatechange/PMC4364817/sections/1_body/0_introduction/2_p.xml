<p class="p">In several special volumes, ecological and evolutionary physiologists pointed out the increasing importance of studying the physiological basis of organism responses to climate change including their tolerance limits to environmental change (e.g., in, “Climate and Evolutionary Physiology,” Chown et al. 
 <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; “Effects of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems,” Browman et al. 
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; “Biological responses in an anthropogenically modified ocean,” Boyd and Hutchins 
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; “Survival in a Changing World,” Barnes et al. 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Physiological study requires identifying the differences in sublethal and lethal effects of climate change within and among species, as a precondition for the successful prediction of ecological effects which result from the success or failure of organisms, populations, and species to cope (e.g., Denny and Helmuth 
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Somero 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; Araujo et al. 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Indeed, individuals exposed to adverse climate change may reach a state that is beyond their capacity to maintain homeostasis and display performances such as growth, reproduction, and behaviors or to defend themselves against biotic and physicochemical stresses. Theoretical and experimental efforts not only need to improve our understanding of thermal limits to organisms, but also to consider effects of multiple drivers both on land (e.g., reduced water availability in warming terrestrial environments) and in the oceans (e.g., combined effect of ocean warming, acidification, and hypoxia). As a consequence of disturbances to organism functioning, fitness may be reduced, populations may lose genetic variation and collapse, and extinction becomes likely (Deutsch et al. 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Folguera et al. 
 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Understanding and explaining these phenomena must involve determining the combined and interactive effects of factors limiting the tolerances and distributions of species, by shaping the relevant physiological characteristics (Pörtner 
 <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>; Bozinovic et al. 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011a</xref>). They must also involve knowledge of the scope of individual plasticity to shift such limits over time as well as the rate and limits of evolutionary adaptation to do so over generations (e.g., Reusch 
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
