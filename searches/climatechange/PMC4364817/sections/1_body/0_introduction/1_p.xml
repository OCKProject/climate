<p class="p">Climate change occurs and becomes effective at global, regional, and local levels (IPCC 
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Presently, temperature changes are evident, yet not similar, on all continents and in the oceans, causing shifts in species phenologies, physiological and behavioral traits, geographic ranges, productivity, and the disruption of diverse species interactions. Thereby, climate change causes pervasive effects on ecosystems (Parmesan 
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Understanding the physiology of differential climate change effects on organisms is one of the many urgent challenges faced by contemporary science (PÃ¶rtner and Farrell 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). For instance, responses of endotherms likely differ from those of ectotherms, those of mobile species differ from those of sedentary ones. Here, we explore further how physiological ecology can contribute to a holistic view of climate change impacts on organisms and ecosystems.
