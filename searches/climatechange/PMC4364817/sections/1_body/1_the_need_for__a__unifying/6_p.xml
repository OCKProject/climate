<p class="p">From the point of view that the complexity principle underlying thermal specialization holds for all organisms in an ecosystem and defines differential, species-specific sensitivities, such specialization will also shape biotic interactions of coexisting species. Additional stressors such as ocean acidification may affect performances of interacting species differently due to divergent physiological ranges, optima, and sensitivities. This will change their fitness in predator prey or competitive interactions. Changes in performance thus produce changes in behaviors and phenologies, and thereby the balance and synchronization of trophic levels and species community structure (Pörtner and Farrell
