<p class="p">Further joint studies by physiologists and ecologists should thus look at species interactions across domains and climate zones, as well as in various, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Overarching mechanistic frameworks, such as OCLTT for animals, need to be developed for all organisms and complemented, for example, under scenarios of warming, hypoxia, and acidification in the ocean, or under drought and changing temperature means, extremes, and variability on land.</p>
