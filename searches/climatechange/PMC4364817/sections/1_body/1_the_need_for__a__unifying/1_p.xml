<p class="p">Various conceptual and modeling approaches address relevant questions, for instance, one in thermal biology on how thermal reaction norms (performance curves) of organisms indicate limits to thermal tolerance (Angilletta

However, these approaches usually do not identify the underlying physiological and biochemical mechanisms that are operative at various levels of biological organization. Recent efforts to understand climate sensitivity of marine ectotherms in the field led to the development of the concept of oxygen and capacity limited thermal tolerance (OCLTT) as a complex framework linking such levels from ecosystem to organism, tissue cell and molecular effects, and the effects of various drivers (PÃ¶rtner

 <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Essentially, the OCLTT concept aims to identify the mechanisms setting the shape and positioning of thermal reaction norms of species and their life stages on the temperature scale. The concept focuses on temperature as the key driving force in climate change impacts on biota, through temperature means, extremes, its changing variability as well as its interactions with other drivers. Here, we emphasize its ability to integrate thermal responses across levels of biological organization.
