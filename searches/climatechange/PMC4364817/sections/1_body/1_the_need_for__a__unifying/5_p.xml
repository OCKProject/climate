<p class="p">Lower complexity levels in most unicellular organisms thus support thermal limits higher than in animals. While the mechanisms causing limitations remain largely unexplored in this group, the complexity hypothesis leads to specific testable predictions: In archaea and bacteria, highest complexity levels may be found in molecular and/or membrane complexes with, for example, metabolic functions; in unicellular eukarya (heterotrophs), earliest functional limits may arise during coordination of mitochondria and cytosol. Eukaryotic phytoplankton with maximum thermal limits similarly low as in animals, possibly experience earliest limits during additional coordination of chloroplasts with mitochondria and the cytosol. This high cellular complexity may be an overarching constraint setting heat tolerance in plants (PÃ¶rtner 
 <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Within each domain, however, individual species and life stages display differential thermal ranges reflecting specialization on temperature regimes, habitat characteristics, and mode of life. Heat limits can be modified by acclimation or adaptation at temperatures below domain-specific limits, but acclimation or evolutionary adaptation cannot overcome the specific limits of the domain as complexity cannot be changed. The OCLTT concept can serve as a role model for studying these principles across organism domains as needed for comprehensively understanding ecosystem level changes. We also suggest that OCLTT may in the end and from an evolutionary point of view, be a key concept able to explain the limited thermal tolerance of metazoans compared to other organisms.
