<p class="p">In addition to identifying the specific vulnerabilities and their variability within and between species, a key issue in understanding ecosystem shifts involves addressing how biotic interactions are modulated by climate, for example, through shifts along temperature-dependent performance curves of interacting organisms (Pörtner and Farrell 
 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>; Storch et al. 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). As interactions involve organisms across all domains an overarching understanding of reaction norms is needed. It may build on the principle hypothesis that sublethal tolerance limits to temperature (influenced by other stressors) are set at the level of biological organization with the highest complexity. The associated limiting process(es) then involve(s) coordination of the largest number of body and cell compartments. In animals, the OCLTT concept proposes that the functional capacity of systems supplying and using oxygen sustains the aerobic performance capacity of the organism (Pörtner

 <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) and becomes limiting at high temperature extremes. This hypothesis is supported by laboratory and field observations of, for example, declining growth and abundance in benthic eelpout, due to oxygen-dependent capacity limitations under extreme summer temperatures (Pörtner and Knust 
 <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Declining exercise performance in migrating salmon sensitive to warming (Eliason et al. 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) also reflects a key limiting role of cardiocirculatory capacity in covering demand.
