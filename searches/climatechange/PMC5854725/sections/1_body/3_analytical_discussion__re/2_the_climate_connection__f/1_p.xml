<p id="Par33" class="p">India is already at high risk of excessive heat. In many places, the maximum temperatures during some parts of the year already exceed 40 °C. An additional 3–5 °C will make outdoor physical work very difficult during the hottest periods (Kjellstrom

WBGT levels are already close to or even above the limit values identified for brick kiln work in Chennai (specifically a WBGT of 28 °C), and that is without even accounting for solar radiation and the contribution of the urban heat island effect (Kleerekoper et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2012</xref>). Temperatures are projected to climb above the limit values of 33 °C for a resting acclimatized worker by the end of the century (Fig.
