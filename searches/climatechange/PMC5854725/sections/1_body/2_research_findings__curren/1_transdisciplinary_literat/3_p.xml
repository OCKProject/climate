<p id="Par11" class="p">While the technical side of brick manufacturing in India has been covered widely in scientific literature, this has not been the case to a similar extent as regards the human part of the industry. The situation for India’s brick kiln workers, however, gained international media coverage starting in 2014 through a number of spectacular articles and TV presentations. Headlines included “More than two million people work in the 
 <italic class="italic">brick kilns</italic> that supply the India’s booming construction sector, and many are held in conditions little better than slavery” (BBC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2014</xref>); “Blood Bricks: How Indian urban boom is built on slave labour” (The Guardian 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2014</xref>); and “India’s booming cities built from ‘blood bricks’ of bonded laborers” (Reuters 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2016</xref>). Media thus directly combined what they saw as slave-like conditions of brick laborers and their families with India’s growing economy and booming urban construction sector. Here we see a strong image combining the “new” and “old,” the hard and the soft India through the figure of the brick and the person producing it. They were, thus, put into new frames and while the industry is seen to look for hard solutions, the human side, as we argue in this article, needs soft solutions and structural change.
