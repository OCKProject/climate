<p id="Par10" class="p">The Central Pollution Control Board has identified brick making as one of the most polluting industries in the small-scale sector (Development for Alternatives 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2012</xref>).Bricks are commonly fired to a temperature of 700–1100 °C, requiring an enormous amount of energy for the firing operation, resulting in brick kiln owners sourcing fuel from many supply streams. The pollution generated as by-products of the combustion process can generate significant negative local health impacts from particulate matter, black carbon, sulfur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon monoxide (CO), and black carbon/soot that contribute to worsening of climate change globally (Menon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2002</xref>). Black carbon by itself is a major health hazard (Löndahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010</xref>), so even mitigating soot production alone could significantly reduce the rate of warming over the next decades (UNEP/WMO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2011</xref>). Brick kilns are estimated to consume roughly 25 million tons of coal per year, thus making them among the highest industrial consumers of coal in the country, which contributes to both climate change globally and local health risks arising from respiratory ailments (CATF 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2012</xref>; UNEP/WMO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition to the brick industry in India consuming an estimated 8% of the total coal consumption in the country, it also consumes a large amount of other fuels, mainly wood and agricultural waste. The industry also uses other available cheap and polluting waste such as rubber tires (Development for Alternatives
