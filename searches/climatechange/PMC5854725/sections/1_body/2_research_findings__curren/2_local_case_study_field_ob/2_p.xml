<p id="Par17" class="p">The field study focused on gathering occupational heat exposure in order to understand the health risks faced by people working at brick kilns. It confirmed that brick kilns are work sites where people are exposed to both extreme outdoor temperatures (maximum ranges between 40 and 45 °C in the hot months) and high radiant heat from brick kiln furnaces over many hours (globe temperatures of between 19 and 52 °C year-around). Additionally, high levels of heat stress are experienced by people working at the brick kilns due to the limited or non-existent cooling options provided on-site by brick kiln owners.</p>
