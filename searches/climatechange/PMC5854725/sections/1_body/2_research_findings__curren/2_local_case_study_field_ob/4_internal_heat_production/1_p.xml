 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>). From brickwork simulations with 1.7-kg bricks carried out by the authors in a climate-controlled chamber measuring oxygen consumption, the average metabolic rate was 133 W/m

From measurements from 114 brick kiln workers in the field of between 3 and 6 h, heart rate averaged 87 bpm in the cool season and 88 bpm in the warm season with a maximum of 116 bpm and a minimum of 60 bpm. Sweat rates averaged 0.4 l/h in the cool season and 0.8 l/h in the warm season with a maximum of 1.2 l/h.
