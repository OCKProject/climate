<p id="Par29" class="p">Clothing also affects the level of heat exposure for each person (ILO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2001</xref>). Traditional clothing such as churidars and saris are commonly worn at the kilns by women, with an average clothing basic insulation range of 0.58 clo for the churidar to 0.96 clo for a sari with a protective shirt and towel on the head. Men usually wear a shirt and trousers with an average clothing insulation of 0.61 clo (Lundgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>; Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2015</xref>). The sari has also proven to be a very effective garment to protect workers from heat (Indraganti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>); however, its effectiveness is hampered by the protective shirt (Lundgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>). Indirectly accounting for moderate metabolic rate, a work limit value for WBGT would be around 28 degrees for the acclimatized worker (ISO 7243
