<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref> indicates that household income had positive beta coefficient (β) suggesting that the variable has influence on adoption of adaptation strategies forest adjacent households developed. This indicates that, a unit change in this variable increases likelihood of increasing the number of adaptation strategies, which was statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05). It is assumed that households with higher income and greater assets are in better position to adopt new farming technologies than those with less. Findings in this study are similar to that of Deressa et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2009</xref>) and Tazeze et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2012</xref>) who found that household income had significant impact on increasing adaptation strategies which include, use of different crop varieties, irrigation technologies, early cultivation and changing planting dates.
