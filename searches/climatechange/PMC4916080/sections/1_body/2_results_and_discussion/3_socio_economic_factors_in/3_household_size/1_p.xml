<p class="p">It was revealed that, household size had positive beta coefficient (β) suggesting significant influence (P ≥ 0.05) on the number of adaptation strategies a household can contain. That implied a unit change in household size increases likelihood of increasing the number of adaptation strategies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). It is anticipated that, a household with large number of individuals increase adaptive capacity to climate change (Nhemachena and Hassan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2013</xref>) at Urumwa Forest Reserve in Tabora region showed that household sizes facilitated the contribution of the livelihoods of local people adjacent to forests resources. Similarly, Gbetibouo (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2009</xref>) in South Africa revealed that a large household is more willing to choose the adaptation options that are labour intensive such as soil conservation techniques, developing irrigation schemes and chemical treatments. Household size determines per capita livelihood diversification hence contribution to people’s adaptive capacity (Ellis
