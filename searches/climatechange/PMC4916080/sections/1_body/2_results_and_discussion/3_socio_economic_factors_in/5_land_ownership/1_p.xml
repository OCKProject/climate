<p class="p">Land ownership is about securing right to long term access to land and their benefits (Lutz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">1994</xref>). Results showed that land ownership had positive beta coefficient (β) suggesting that it influences the number of adaptation strategies especially when people decided to have more than three options (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab10" ref-type="table" class="xref">10</xref>). The variable was not significant (P ≥ 0.05) when people opted to have two to three adaptation strategies. This could probably be associated with the security on land ownership. Secured ownership enables people to have various adaptation strategies developed on the particular land. Farmers who own land are more likely to invest in various adaptation options, including crop and livestock management practices and water conservation. Studies show that land ownership encourages the adoption of various technologies linked to land including irrigation, drainage, tree planting and crop diversification (Lutz et al.
