<p class="p">The study has also revealed prevalence of a shift in use patterns of NTFPs from subsistence to trade for income generation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>). NTFPs were both consumed and traded to get income that was used for various human needs. According to Nkem et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2010</xref>), “NTFPs are fundamentally the niche for poor population, which make them important for addressing poverty, health problems and adaptation to external shocks and stresses”. The current study recorded relatively higher annual average of collected firewood that was traded than that used for subsistence which was 292.8 ± 14.3 and 116.5 ± 4.6 head loads, respectively. Similarly, annual average consumption per household of medicinal plants and thatch grasses were also high (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table" class="xref">8</xref>). This indicates that most of the forest adjacent households used NTFPs for trade in order to get immediate cash income that was used for various household needs including health services, food and shelter especially when main source of income (i.e. agriculture) is adversely affected by floods.
