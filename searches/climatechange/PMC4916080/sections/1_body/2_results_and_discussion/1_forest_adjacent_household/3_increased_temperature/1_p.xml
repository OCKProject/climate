<p class="p">Increased temperature was reported to cause moisture stress in crops as well as increase prevalence of both animal and plant pests and diseases. The majority (79Â %) of the respondents reported that crops have been wilting due to moisture stress, thus reducing crop yields. Moisture stress has also been related to an outbreak of army worms (pests) and rice yellow mottle virus (RYMV) disease in rice crops. These results concur with observations made by Akponikpe et al. (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2013</xref>) in Pangani River Basin and Pemba in Tanzania, where both reported moisture stress as a fundamental cause of increasing susceptibility of the crops to other stresses like pests and diseases, leading to reduced crop yield. According to Allarangaye et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2006</xref>) and Michel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2008</xref>), RYMV is the most important virus disease for rice in Africa which reduces paddy productivity.
