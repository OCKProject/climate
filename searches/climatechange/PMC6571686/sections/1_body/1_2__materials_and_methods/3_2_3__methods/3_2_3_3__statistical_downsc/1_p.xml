The SDSM screens the predictors closely related to the predictands and builds an empirical statistical relationship between the predictands (climate variables of the observed meteorological stations) and the predictors (ERA-40 reanalysis data) based on multiple linear regression. In summary, the SDSM assumes that the empirical statistical relationship is constant in the case of future changes in climatic conditions.
