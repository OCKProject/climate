 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Actual evaporation and transpiration rates were respectively obtained as a function of the available soil water in the surface soil and the root zone. Crop growth and yield were calculated using the modified EPIC crop growth model [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-01706" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. This module described the crop growth based on accumulated temperature. It can simulate the leaf area development, light interception, and the conversion of intercepted light into biomass and yield together with effects of temperature, water and salt stress.
