 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, compared with the precipitation during the baseline period at the 17 stations (excepting the Tuole and Qilian stations), the mean annual precipitation over the next 30 years showed a decreasing trend under all three RCP scenarios. The mean annual precipitation of the Tuole station had an increasing trend under all three RCP scenarios, while that of the Qilian station decreased under RCP2.6, but increased under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Among the 15 stations with decreasing precipitation in the future, the decreasing magnitude of the future precipitation in Jikede, Guazihu, Yumen Town, Alxa Right Banner, Yongchang, and Menyuan declined with the concentration increase of RCP, i.e., RCP2.6 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP8.5, while there was no clear pattern for the amount of decrease in precipitation at the other stations. From the whole basin perspective, the precipitation of stations in the upper reaches of the HRB under three future climate scenarios decreased only slightly or even increased (e.g., Qilian area), while the precipitation in the border areas of the middle and lower reaches decreased by more than 15%. According to the 
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01706-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the mean annual precipitation in the future period under the three RCP scenarios would all decline with the decrease being the most obvious under the RCP4.5 scenario, up to 5.22%.
