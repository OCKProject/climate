 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>, compared with the field experiment period of 2012–2015, the mean annual yield of maize in the Gaotai area under the three RCP scenarios all showed a decreasing trend. Meanwhile, the decreasing magnitude of the future mean annual yield in Gaotai area declined with the CO

Although temperatures were projected to keep rising in the next 30 years, the mean annual CWC exhibited a decreasing trend due to unchanged irrigation schedule and projected decreases of precipitation. The decreases of CWC under different RCP scenarios all exceeded −12%, with the largest decline being −14.73% under the RCP4.5 scenario. In addition, Xu et al. [

In this study, from the perspective of elevated CO
