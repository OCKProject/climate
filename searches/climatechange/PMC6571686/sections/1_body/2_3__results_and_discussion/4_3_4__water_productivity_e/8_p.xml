 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01706-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> illustrated the inter-decadal water productivities under the historical period and three future climate scenarios in the Gaotai and Ganzhou areas. Driven by the projected climate change scenarios including the increases of the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, and T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub>, and the decreases of the wind speed and precipitation, the water productivities displayed an increase under all three RCP scenarios. The water productivities during the next three decades under all RCP scenarios were greater than those of the historical period from 2012â€“2015. Interestingly, the WP reached the greatest in both Gaotai and Ganzhou areas under the medium emission scenario (RCP4.5) instead of the extreme emission scenario (RCP8.5) with the most significant temperature rising, implying that water, heat, and carbon projected under the RCP4.5 scenario in the middle irrigated areas of the HRB synergized the best for the crop growth. As time went on, the WP became higher under all RCP scenarios, which was consistent with the increase of temperature.
