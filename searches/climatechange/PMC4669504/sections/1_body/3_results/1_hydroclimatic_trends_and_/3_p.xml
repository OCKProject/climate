<p class="p">Change-points of annual precipitation (PET) occurred in about 1955 (1950) and 1992 (1989) for non-RHBN and RHBN watersheds, respectively. Annual precipitation has increased 5–35% in southern Canada over 1990–1998
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, and abrupt changes often happened earlier in western than in eastern watersheds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). For non-RHBN watersheds, differences in detected change-points between streamflow and climate data can be attributed to human activities. From periods-1 to -2, changes to the mean annual precipitation range from -44 to 158 mm, with a significant decrease in central CR and northern Canada but a significant increase in southern Canada. Most British Columbia (BC) and northern Canada showed an increase (0–30 mm) in the mean annual PET, but southern Canada generally a decrease (0–18 mm) (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> had generally increased in southern but some had decreased in northern watersheds of Canada (
