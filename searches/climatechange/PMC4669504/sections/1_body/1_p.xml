<p class="p">It is a challenge to quantify human contribution to changes in streamflow
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> partly because human disturbances incur changes to many subsystems such as atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, land surface and biosphere
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Instead of using deterministic rainfall-runoff models to assess the impacts of climate change or human activities on runoff for each watershed, in this study we used observed precipitation, streamflow and estimated PET data to separate direct impacts of human activities from impacts of climate change (even though the latter is related to human impacts) to changes in Canadian streamflow based on the Budyko Framework
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The Budyko Framework assumes that the long-term water balance of a watershed based on the dryness index of actual evaporation to precipitation,

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>, is primarily a function of the atmospheric supply and demand of water, expressed as the ratio of PET to precipitation,

In other words, the Budyko Framework enables us to predict hydrologic responses of a watershed to a wide range of climatic conditions with respect to the characteristics of the watershed, such as land properties, terrain features and others.
