 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Methods</xref>) offers another explanation to streamflow responding to effects of climate change and human activities based on the Budyko framework. This method also assumes no indirect human-induced streamflow change resulted from human influence on the climate change. Unlike the elasticity method which uses a first-order approximation of the Budyko equation (Equation

The streamflow change is divided into two parts, so that Budyko-based methods can separately account for direct human-induced and climate-induced streamflow changes due to changes in both precipitation and PET.
