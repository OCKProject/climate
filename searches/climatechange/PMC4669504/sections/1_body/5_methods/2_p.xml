<p class="p">Since available streamflow data is less complete than precipitation and temperature data, only watersheds with long-term streamflow data were selected in this study. The RHBN streamflow data of WSC have been extensively used for climate change studies, since RHBN data are characterized by relatively pristine and stable land-use conditions (&lt;5% of the land surface modified) with at least 20 years of record. A total of 36 RHBN watersheds with daily streamflow data of 1971–2010 were selected for this study. Further, daily streamflow data of 60 non-RHBN stations that began no later than 1960 were also selected for this study (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">S2</xref>). In this study, the total annual depth of streamflow was estimated for station drainage areas while the total annual values of other hydroclimatic variables were estimated for actual watershed areas. Next, the gridded, monthly precipitation dataset
