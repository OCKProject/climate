<p class="p">The AC speleothem δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C record reproduces the DO pacing of the Greenland ice core record during the MUPT (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The TC δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record reproduces some aspects of the Greenland record. The climatic meaning of the AC δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C data may be constrained within context of other records from the region, particularly the Black Sea (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The coherency of the AC δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C record with southern Black Sea IRDc (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>) implies that speleothem δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C responded to changes in the length of the sea ice and winter frost season. Chemically, speleothem δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C depends on the proportion of low δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C aqueous CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> derived from microbial respiration of soil organic matter above the cave (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). Extended frost and shorter plant growth seasons reduces the supply of fresh soil organic matter (SOM) and increases the proportion of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from old SOM in drip water, which has up to 8‰ higher δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C than fresh SOM under comparable conditions (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Other potential controls are insufficient to explain the 6‰ amplitude of DO cycles in the speleothem. For example, the effect of a seasonally variable CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> degassing rate from drip water may add a kinetic fractionation effect on the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C of precipitating speleothem calcite (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). However, recent monitoring showed that interannual variability in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C of precipitating calcite in AC is less than 1.5‰ (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Similarity between the AC δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O records is limited (

 </ext-link>)—another qualitative argument against major kinetic isotope fractionation. Also, a compositional change in SOM δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C can be ruled out as variability in Central European paleosol profiles does not exceed 1‰ during the MUPT (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>). Finally, variable moisture availability may have influenced soil formation above the cave and speleothem δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C. The Danube loess record suggests such an interval of enhanced moisture availability after GI8 (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). The AC-speleothem δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record does indeed suggest some change to that effect between GS8 and GI7, but the overall pacing across the MUPT resembles that of southeastern Mediterranean records and shows little coherency with DO cycles (see below). In general, soil formation intervals recorded by low values in AC-δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C are coeval with the range of ages obtained for paleosols in the upper Danube Willendorf II profile (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). This suggests that the entire Danube region was inside the same climate zone and responded coherently to temperature change during DO cycles of the MUPT.
