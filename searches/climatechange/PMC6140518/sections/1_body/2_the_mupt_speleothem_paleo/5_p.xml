 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O and the other paleoclimate record. After ∼60 ka, the δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record shows low-amplitude variability with a few pronounced minima of ∼0.5‰ that are coeval with some of the Greenland stadials (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). These include GS3-H2, GS5-H3, and GS13-H5. Other minima just after 34 ka and at 41 ka correspond to GS7 and GS10 (

 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>). Although there may be a few centuries of overlap with GS9-H4, the measured age interval of 40.7–39.8 ka
 <sub class="sub">U-Th</sub>, ±0.47 to ±0.3 uncertainty, matches GS10 (40.80–40.16 ka

 <sub class="sub">U-Th</sub> and a subsequent broad relative δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O minimum in the TC record appear to be coeval with GI9 and GS9-H4, which apparently had a lesser impact on Central European climate. The TC δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record thus responded to stadial cooling in the Atlantic but with a regionally controlled amplitude. Similarity with the northern Black Sea paleotemperature archive suggests this response is temperature driven (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For two reasons, TC δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O likely records the local summer temperature signal. First, the northern Black Sea record shows that summer sea surface temperature between 40 and 20 ka cal BP dropped by ∼2 °C during stadials from a MIS3 average of 4–5 °C (

 <sub class="sub">w</sub>/Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> = 0.58 (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>)—the 0.4–0.6‰ δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O amplitude in the TC speleothem would correspond to a comparable 1.0–1.5 °C temperature change. Second, palynologic, geomorphologic, and geochemical studies support this interpretation as follows. During the last glacial, the lowlands north of the East Carpathians were situated inside the tundra biome, where field evidence of ice wedges indicates permafrost conditions (
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Deep winter frost or even discontinuous permafrost is a likely scenario for the &gt;1,000-m altitude of the ground above TC in the East Carpathians. At 20–40 ka, the average ground temperature of the northern Black Sea drainage basin—comprising the Danube, Dniestr, Dniepr, and Don Lowlands—was ∼4 °C (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Common adiabatic gradients of 6–10 °C per km of altitude imply that annual average ground temperatures above TC were lower than −2 °C. This suggests an alpine near-permafrost environment. Permafrost conditions may have been continuous during extreme stadials, thus preventing groundwater recharge to the cave and interrupting speleothem growth. During GS12—the coldest of all stadials in the Greenland record—the TC speleothem shows a hiatus coeval with the most pronounced δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C maximum in the AC speleothem further south. In the Willendorf II loess profile, this interval correlates with tundra gley horizon C9 with evidence of permafrost (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). C9 is constrained in time by paleosols C8-3 above and D1 underneath with dating ranges similar to GI11 and GI12, respectively. The Willendorf II profile is located at the same latitude as the TC speleothem, but only at 230-m altitude. Continuous permafrost conditions at 950-m altitude in the East Carpathians were thus likely during GS12. Seasonally permeable frost or discontinuous permafrost at other times would restrict speleothem growth to the summer season. Unlike the hydrologically dominated AC δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O record, TC δ
 <sup class="sup">18</sup>O-only records regional summer temperature change.
