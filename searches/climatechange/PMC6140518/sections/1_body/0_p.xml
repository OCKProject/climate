<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">The replacement of Neanderthals by modern humans is recorded across Europe in a diachronous and culturally complex succession of distinct stone tool assemblages from the Middle–Upper Paleolithic transition (MUPT) roughly between 48 and 36 ka cal BP [calendar years before present (1950)] (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). The succession often includes a regionally distinct “transitional” assemblage of local origin, or an intrusive Initial Upper Paleolithic assemblage between the Neanderthal Mousterian and modern human Aurignacian. The oldest anatomically modern human remains from Europe—found in East-Central Europe and radiocarbon dated to 40.6–38.6 ka cal BP (68% probability) toward the time of Neanderthals’ disappearance from most of continental Europe—carry genetic evidence for species interbreeding four to six generations earlier (

 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>), and the archeologic record provides no site with indication of local coexistence. Within a few millennia after the MUPT, at least two other genetically distinct modern human populations came to subsequently dominate Middle Pleniglacial Europe. During the entire interval, northern hemispheric climate went through several millennial-scale Dansgaard–Oeschger (DO) cold cycles (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). A causality between climate change, the archeologic succession, and modern humans’ genetic makeup has been tentatively suggested but not demonstrated (

 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). Below, we present the climatic history of continental Europe during the MUPT and derive the impact of climate change on MUPT demography, which may have led to the apparent repetitive genome turnover reported for Europe’s human population during the middle pleniglacial.
