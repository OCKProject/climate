 <xref rid="r57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>). Increasing cold and aridity around the onset of GS12 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) appears to mark transitions in the archeologic sequence attributable to Neanderthals that suggest some adaptation as well. GS12 is coeval with the transition from Mousterian to archaic Uluzzian, and then to evolved Uluzzian in northern Italy (
 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>), and from Mousterian to Châtelperronian in Western Europe (
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>). However, late Neanderthals may have had a less diverse diet than modern humans (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>). In open grasslands, Neanderthals’ exclusive diet was meat from terrestrial animals, whereas modern human Aurignacian also exploited plant and aquatic foods (
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>). The frequently observed cultural hiatuses, however, do not suggest a direct competitive displacement of Neanderthals, but rather a higher vulnerability to rapid environmental change and ecologic stress in the open landscape during cold and arid GS12–GS10. While Neanderthals did not survive GS12 in most of the Danube steppe and tundra, modern humans may have been more capable to adapt and habitat track the expanding steppe in Central Europe. GS10 likely caused a repeat of that process in Western Europe.
