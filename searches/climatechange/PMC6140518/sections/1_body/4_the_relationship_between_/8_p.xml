<p class="p">The Moravian record suggests contemporaneity of modern humans—the Bohunician—and Neanderthals—the Szeletian—at close geographic proximity during GI12 and perhaps later but with some chronologic uncertainty (
 <xref rid="r63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>). During GI11-10, the situation is comparable for the Aurignacian and Mousterian on the upper Danube—at Keilberg-Kirche and Sesselfelsgrotte (see above)—and for Aurignacian and Szeletian on the middle Danube—at Pes-kὅ Cave and Szeleta Cave (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>) principally confirms true contemporaneity along the northern fringe of the steppe landscape in the Danube Valley. Nonetheless, in the subsequent ∼6 millennia after GS10, the modern human genome in Europe was replaced twice with a different genetic lineage harboring a much older Neanderthal ancestry (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). One modern European genetic branch found inside Goyet Cave (Belgium), was attributed to the late Aurignacian and dated to ∼35 ka cal BP—coeval with GI7. This interval of modern human repopulation may have followed the extended cold interval from GS10 to GS9-H4, over 4,000 y long and only interrupted briefly by the 250-y-long GI9 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). A different genetic branch then dominated Europe after ∼34 ka cal BP—coeval to the end of the severe and 1,000-y-long GS7 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). This lineage was attributed to the Gravettian (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>), who repopulated Europe during yet another time of low population density (
 <xref rid="r68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>). The discussion above lays out a general scenario of depopulation–repopulation cycles associated with steppe landscape expansion following extreme or long stadials. The comparable timing of stadials and population changes seen in the archeologic and genetic record suggests that millennial-scale climate cycles may have been the pacesetter for Europe’s demographic history during the Middle Pleniglacial.
