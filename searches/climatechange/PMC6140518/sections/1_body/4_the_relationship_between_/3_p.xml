<p class="p">Circumstantial evidence points to a similar impact of GS12 in northern Italy, where two sites, Riparo Mochi on the Ligurian Mediterranean coast—layer H—and at Grotta di Fumane in the Venetian Pre-Alps—layer A7—contain sterile layers probably coeval with GS12. However, reliable dating is only available for the base of the subsequent archeologic layer (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>) and age uncertainty is large (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). A muted response to GS12 may be inferred for the site of Grotte Mandrin, Rhone Valley, where sterile layers separate strata C, B3, and B2 with post-Neronian-II artifacts (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). Layers B3–B1 of this latest regional Mousterian expression were dated in the range between 42.7 and 45.0 ka BP (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>). These layers may indicate environmental change but do not appear to reflect longer breaks in the site’s occupation. No such layers associated with GS12 are reported from archeologic sites further west. This suggests that the environmental impact of GS12 may have been less severe in Western Europe.
