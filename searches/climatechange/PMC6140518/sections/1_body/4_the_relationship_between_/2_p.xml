<p class="p">A number of chronologically well-constrained archeologic records allow for testing directly the feasibility of a regional depopulation scenario during severe stadials. Culturally (nearly) sterile layers have been reported—directly 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C dated or constrained by 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C-dated cultural layers above and below—in some regions and mark an archeological hiatus of several centuries duration. While such layers in some places represent short-term sedimentologic events without apparent discontinuity of habitation (
 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>), at many sites their time span is multicentennial. These layers mostly relate chronologically to the time of GS12 and GS10, and suggest regionally widespread depopulation for many centuries between two subsequent cultures. (

 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>) and is directly dated to 44.4–42.7 and 43.5–42.0 ka cal BP by two samples, with a Bayesian model age of 42.9–42.1 ka cal BP (
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). At Sesselfelsgrotte, sterile layer F is directly constrained by Mousterian layer G1, 45.8–44.3 ka cal BP, and the late Mousterian layer E3, 42.2–40.5 ka cal BP, both recalibrated (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). At Willendorf II, sterile layer C9 and subsequent layer C8-3 containing Aurignacian artifacts are constrained between two dated paleosols D1 and C8-2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Mousterian Neanderthal presence in the middle Danube region has been redated to until ∼45 ka cal BP, just before GS12 (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). Two sites with Aurignacian finds, at Keilberg-Kirche (
 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>), 43.6–41.7 ka cal BP recalibrated (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>), and at Pes-kὅ Cave, 43.8–41.2 ka cal BP (
 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>), immediately postdate GS12. These fit the scenario of a cultural hiatus but lack local constraint by older assemblages. All of the above suggest widespread Mousterian Neanderthal depopulation of the upper and middle Danube Valley and—except for the tributary Altmühl Valley (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>)—repopulation by Aurignacian after GS12.
