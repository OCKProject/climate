 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Major steps in the evolution of African hominids and other vertebrates at 2.8 Ma, 1.7 Ma, and 1.0 Ma coincided with climatic shifts to more arid and open conditions, suggesting that some Plio-Pleistocene speciation events may have been climatically mediated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. In southwest Asia, the climatic impact of the Younger Dryas (about 12,900 to 11,600 years before the present, BP) changed the developmental trajectory of the Natufians, who replaced seasonally nomadic hunting and gathering activities with new labor-intensive subsistence strategies of plant cultivation and animal husbandry

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. The collapse of the classic Mayan Empire was connected to the abrupt shift to arid conditions in the Yucatan Peninsula between 1,300–1,100 calendar yr BP, as recorded by several lake sediment records
