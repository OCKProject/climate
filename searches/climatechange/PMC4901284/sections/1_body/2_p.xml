<p class="p">In this study, we obtained a paleoclimatic record from a 460-cm-long sediment record from the largest and most integrated archaeological site in Yuchisi, Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, eastern China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Based on the archaeological evidence, the Yuchisi site was an important geographical location: a rudimentary city with flourishing architecture and an important Neolithic cultural centre that attracted a significant population during the Neolithic period

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. As identified by the archaeological analysis, the Yuchisi site recorded two important Chinese prehistoric cultures: the Late Dawenkou Culture (5,050–4,400 yr BP) and the Longshan Culture (4,400–4,000 yr BP)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The location of the studied sediment profile (YC1) was carefully selected in order to avoid possible disturbance by human activity. It was located in an open area which apparently had not been used for habitation, cultivation, or metalworking. It is the least disturbed site in the vicinity. The linear age-depth relationship confirms that no significant human disturbance occurred at the location

In the present study, we analyzed organic biomarkers in the sediments and use the results to consider how the near-simultaneous climate changes and cultural transition at the Yuchisi site are reflected in similar occurrences on a global basis.
