<p class="p">The length of the time lag depends upon the amplitude, abruptness, and duration of the climate change, and the stability of human societies. A less abrupt or lower amplitude change is more likely to enable the adaptation of both ecosystems and economies, and is thus may be less disruptive. In contrast, changes can be more devastating when they are abrupt and unpredictable

However, the changes in paleotemperature biomarkers and the cultural transition at Yuchisi took place abruptly and simultaneously, and the human societal response was direct, with no time lag. This suggests the possibility that the Holocene IRD Event 3 may have been sufficiently intense in central China to have induced an almost immediate cultural response.
