<p class="p">Several studies have pointed out that the chronologies of palaeoclimatic records and of archaeological material from different sites, even those in close proximity, could result in an apparent time lag between the climatic change and the vegetation response of up to 300 years

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> may have commenced as early as 4,500 yr BP, although the Neolithic cultural transformations occurred at about 4,200–4,000 yr BP, a lag of several hundred years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. In Egypt, the mid- to late Holocene climatic transition also occurred at around 4,500 calendar yr BP, several hundred years earlier than the collapse of Egyptian civilization at around 4,000 yr BP
