<p class="p">The period from 4,400–4,000 yr BP was important for both cultural evolution and climate change in China. In China, other fiefdom-like cultures, such as the Liangzhu, Shijiahe, Qijia, and Laohushan, had the potential to evolve into more complex societies, but they all collapsed from about 4,400–4,200 yr BP

On a global scale, many notable prehistoric cultures such as the Akkadian empire of Mesopotamia; the pyramid-constructing Old Kingdom civilization of Egypt; the Harappan 3B civilization of the Indus valley; and the Early Bronze III civilizations of Palestine, Greece, and Crete; all reached their economic peaks around 4,300 yr BP. They then terminated abruptly before 4,200 yr BP as a result of catastrophic drought and cooling
