<p class="p">Numerous studies have considered the mechanism behind these climatic changes, including the role of the triggering of changes in the thermo- and hydrodynamic- circulation of the Earth caused by changes in solar irradiation, ocean variability, changes in atmospheric composition, and/or environmental threshold events

Solar irradiation is the major energy input to the Earth’s climate system, and increases in solar irradiation enhance easterly winds, leading to poleward shifts in the positions of the subtropical westerly jets, broadening of the tropical Hadley circulations, and poleward shifts in storm tracks, and vice versa
