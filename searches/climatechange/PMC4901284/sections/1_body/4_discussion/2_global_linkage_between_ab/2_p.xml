<p class="p">Numerous (over one hundred) natural archives from around the world record a remarkable climatic shift involving the sharply increased occurrence of drought, wetter conditions or floods, major dust storms, and possibly other climatic anomalies, at this time. The distribution of some of these events is illustrated in
