<p class="p">In China, records from mountain glaciers and lacustrine sediments document the occurrence of drought in the north and flooding in the south at around the same time, a situation linked theoretically with the collapse of prehistoric cultures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" class="xref">49</xref>. In North America during the interval from 4300–4100 yr BP, a pronounced drought, with large and widespread ecological effects, impacted the region from the Great Lakes to the Central Plains, while the largest floods occurred in Arizona and Utah
