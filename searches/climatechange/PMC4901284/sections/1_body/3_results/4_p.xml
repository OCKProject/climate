<p class="p">Within the YC1 profile, TOC and the Chenopodiaceae/total pollen ratio remain relatively stable during the Late Dawenkou Culture and the Longshan Culture. However, during the cultural transition layers, no pollen grains could be recovered, suggesting the occurrence of an extremely dry climatic event
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Although the total pollen did not vary significantly before and after the climatic transition at around 4,400 yr BP, the Chenopodiaceae/total pollen ratio increased from 2% to 22%. This finding is consistent with an increase in the alkane ratio 2C
