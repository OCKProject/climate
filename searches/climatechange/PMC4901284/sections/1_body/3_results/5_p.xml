<p class="p">The YC1 profile reveals abrupt changes in the concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanols at around 4,400 yr BP. A significant change in 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>-ol occurs in the layer corresponding to the transition between the Dawenkou and Longshan cultures; however, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-C
 <sub class="sub">30</sub>-ol exhibits only a small amount of variation. The concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-C
 <sub class="sub">18</sub>-ol and n-C
 <sub class="sub">30</sub>-ol exhibit respective increases from 0.68–4.78 μg/g, and from 0.28–0.47 μg/g, between 214 cm and 210 cm; followed by respective decreases to 0.83 μg/g and 0.19 μg/g at 206 cm. In general, the epicuticular waxes of higher plants contain even carbon number 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanols from C
 <sub class="sub">26</sub> to C
 <sub class="sub">30</sub>, while lower plants (e.g., aquatic algae) have 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanol distributions dominated by C
 <sub class="sub">16</sub> to C
 <sub class="sub">22</sub> components
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. The profiles of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>-alkanols in profile YC1 suggest that the lower plants underwent more dramatic changes than did the higher plants.
