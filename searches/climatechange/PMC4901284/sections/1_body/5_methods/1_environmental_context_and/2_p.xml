<p class="p">We sampled a sediment profile, named YC1, from the south wall of the central excavation pit above the moat water level. This pit was 4.6-m-deep, and its cultural layers and its chronology have been studied in detail; 230 samples were collected from the south wall at an interval of 2â€‰cm. From top to bottom, the pit was divided into eight layers or strata (
