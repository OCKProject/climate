 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. Charcoal fragments from the profile were dated at the Key Laboratory of Heavy Ion Physics, Peking University, in the Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) Facility. The correlation coefficient between age and depth is 0.986 (p &lt; 0.01), and the average sediment accumulation rate is close to 0.38 cm/yr. There are no age reversals and no obvious change in the accumulation rates of different layers, indicating the absence of significant disturbance occurred during the deposition history of YC1 (see detailed information in
