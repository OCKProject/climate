<p class="p">The Yuchisi archeological site is located between the Yellow and Huai Rivers, in Mengcheng County (32°55′-33°29′N, 116°16′-116°46′E), Anhui Province, eastern China (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). It was excavated by the Archeological Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (AI-CASS). With an area about 100,000 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, it is the largest and most integrated site with abundant prehistoric architectural remains in eastern China. A number of building foundations, with room numbers from 1 to 5, have been excavated. Since 1990, archeologists from AI-CASS have explored the site 13 times and discovered numerous bones, porcelain shards, and mortuary objects. The Yuchisi site is exposed roughly at the center of a hill and 2–3 m above ground; it is bounded on its western and southern sides by small unsurfaced roads, and on its eastern side by a modern artificial canal. The hill approximates a square with dimensions of 370 m (east-west) by 250 m (north-south). The remains of an ancient moat, which surrounds the architectural complex of the late Dawenkou Culture, are evident at the site. The moat has a north-south span of 230~240 m, an east-west span of 220 m, a width of 25–30 m, and a depth of 4.5 m. The moat forms a circle with an outlet in the south-west corner. Along the north-south axis of the moat and in its center are three archaeological excavation pits.
