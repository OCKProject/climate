<p class="p">The alkanes and the derivatives of the alcohol and acidic fraction were analyzed using an HP 5890 gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer with a DB-5 ms (50 m × 0.32 mm and 0.25 μm film thickness) capillary column (J&amp;W). Helium was used as the carrier gas. The mass spectrometer was operated in EI mode at 70 eV. The MS data was acquired in the full mode and processed with the Chemstation data system.</p>
