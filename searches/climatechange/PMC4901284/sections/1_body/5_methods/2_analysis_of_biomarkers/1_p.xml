<p class="p">The sediment samples were collected and stored in pre-cleaned brown glass jars. For organic biomarker analysis, freeze-dried sediment samples were Soxhlet extracted for 72 h with a 2:1 dichloromethane/methanol mix. The extracts were concentrated by rotary evaporation and then saponified using 0.5 M KOH/MeOH. Neutral lipids were partitioned out of the basic solution with hexane. The pH of the saponified extract was then brought to 2 using 6 N HCl, and acidic lipids were extracted with 20% methylene chloride in hexane. The acidic lipids were kept in anhydrous Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>SO
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> overnight to remove ant traces of water. The neutral lipids were further separated using (5% deactivated) silica gel column chromatography using solvents of increasing polarity from hexane to methylene chloride. The alcohol and acid fractions were treated with 
 <italic class="italic">N,O</italic>-bistrimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (BSTFA) to form trimethylsilyl (TMS)-ether and ester derivatives.
