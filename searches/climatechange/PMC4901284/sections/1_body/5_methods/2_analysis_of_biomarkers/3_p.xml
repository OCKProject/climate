<p class="p">The GC oven for alkanes, alcohols and acid fractions was programmed as follows. Alkanes: hold 2 min at 60 °C, increase to 200 °C at 7 °C/min, and then increase to 280 °C at 3 °C/min, and hold 30 min at 280 °C. Alcohols: hold 2 min at 60 °C, increase to 200 °C at 10 °C/min, increase to 280 °C at 3.5 °C/min, hold 15 min at 280°C, increase to 300 °C at 1.5 °C/min, and hold 30 min at 300 °C. Acids: hold 2 min at 60 °C, increase to 150 °C at 10 °C/min, increase to 300 °C at 2.5 °C/min, hold 30 min.</p>
