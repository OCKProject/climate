 <p class="p">We thank the many hikers on Vancouver Island who submitted ptarmigan sightings to K. Martin at the University of British Columbia. We also thank Krista Kaptein and staff at the Strathcona Wilderness Institute for their partnership and dedication to the citizen science ptarmigan program on Vancouver Island. Thomas Edwards provided valuable suggestions and guidance on the species distribution modeling. Several field assistants and laboratory technicians provided organizational assistance for the public records from 1995 to the present.</p>
