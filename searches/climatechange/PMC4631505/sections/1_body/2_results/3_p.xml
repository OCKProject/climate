<p class="p">Habitat suitability under baseline climate was greatest at high elevations inside Strathcona Provincial Park in the center of Vancouver Island, with small patches of highly suitable habitat in the northern and southern mountains (
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Habitat suitability declined across all of Vancouver Island by the 2080s under both RCP scenarios. Most of ptarmigan baseline range is predicted to contain only low suitability habitat by the 2080s under the highest greenhouse gas scenario (RCP 8.5). Habitat suitability is predicted to remain highest within the Forbidden Plateau region in the southeast corner of Strathcona Provincial Park, with a fairly large patch of moderately to highly suitable habitat remaining by 2085 under the lower greenhouse gas scenario but only a few small patches of moderately suitable habitat remaining under the high greenhouse gas scenario.
