<p class="p">The threshold-independent area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC) measure of model accuracy revealed high predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.94 ± 0.008). The threshold habitat suitability chosen to maximize model sensitivity at 0.90 was 0.36; all pixels with habitat suitability above the threshold were considered “suitable” and those below the threshold were considered “unsuitable.” Specificity (% of pseudo-absences correctly classified) was 0.86, and the RF model performed within the ‘excellent’ range of the kappa index (kappa = 0.73; [
