 <xref rid="pone.0142110.g007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). This increase in number of patches corresponds with a 52% reduction in mean patch size from 6.6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> to 3.2 (± 0.03) km

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.g005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), are predicted to become fragmented into several smaller patches. In particular, the three currently largest patches of suitable habitat are predicted to become fragmented into several smaller patches by the 2080s (
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.g008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). The largest patch by the 2080s accounts for 25–29% of the predicted remaining habitat area under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 5–9% of predicted remaining habitat area under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The Can GCM and RCP 8.5 greenhouse gas scenario depict the most dire predictions of habitat change for White-tailed Ptarmigan, with total loss of all habitat patches larger than 6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 97% of all remaining habitat patches &lt; 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Average elevation of suitable habitat patches is predicted to increase from 1,350 m (± 84) under the baseline climate to 1,459–1,472 m under the RCP 4.5 scenario and 1,501–1,508 m under the RCP 8.5 scenario by the 2080s (
