<p class="p">From this field survey dataset, we extracted summer (Juneâ€“October) observations and eliminated sightings of juveniles, since they were usually found at or near the same GPS coordinate as their parent during the summer period. We then eliminated duplicates at the same GPS point (i.e., if a flock of several birds was recorded at one point, only one observation was included in the final dataset). To minimize bias due to certain individuals being observed more than others, we first eliminated records from the same individual that were &lt; 1 day apart, and then randomly selected two records per individual. Lastly, we randomly selected one observation within each 100-m grid cell of the environmental predictor GIS layers. All filtering of the original ptarmigan data was carried out using R 3.1.2.</p>
