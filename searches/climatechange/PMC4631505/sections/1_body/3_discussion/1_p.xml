<p class="p">Our approach predicts that Vancouver Island White-tailed Ptarmigan may lose a substantial portion of their habitat as early as the 2020s, as patches become smaller and increasingly fragmented. The GCMs differed very little in their estimates of habitat loss and configuration, whereas greenhouse gas concentration scenarios depicted very different futures for VIWTP habitat. By the 2080s, we predict VIWTP will lose at least 53%, or as high as 77%, of their habitat under the low and high greenhouse gas scenarios, respectively. Our predictions are consistent with predictions of significant range contractions for other high elevation specialist species as a consequence of global climate change [
