<p class="p">After elevation, mean summer temperature and precipitation as snow were the second and third most important variables for predicting VIWTP distributions. Changes in these climate variables will likely drive habitat loss. Increased annual mean summer temperature will likely correspond with increased frequency of extreme heat days, which may stress birds and lead to reduced fecundity or survival [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Warmer summers and reduced snowfall will also lead to the loss of permanent snow fields, which are important for ptarmigan thermoregulation and for providing sufficient moisture for ptarmigan forage [

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. As the number of snow-free days during the year increase, birds with white plumage against a dark background may be at increased risk of predation, especially independent but naive juveniles. Birds may adapt to changing conditions through evolutionary changes in their molt response to photoperiod and increased ability to tolerate heat, but such selective responses are likely to be slow [
