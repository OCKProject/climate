<p class="p">Even if ptarmigan can utilize microrefugia, it is unlikely that populations will be able to persist in their current numbers. Extinction probability increases with reduced range size and connectivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], and climate change will increase the variability of extreme temperatures and weather events in high elevation habitats [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Ptarmigan must be able to live and reproduce through these extreme episodes if they are to persist. Alpine birds tend to exhibit slower life histories than low elevation populations of the same or similar species, where high elevation individuals have the lowest breeding success but higher survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. More frequent episodes of extreme conditions may alter the fitness consequences of alternative life-history strategies and exceed the coping abilities of alpine-breeding birds.
