<p class="p">The persistence of populations in the central and northern regions of Vancouver Island will depend partially on the ability of birds to utilize smaller areas at higher densities. Alpine ibex (

 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], which also may be the case for ptarmigan especially if the quality of “suitable” habitat declines. For instance, ptarmigan may encounter more competition from lower elevation competitors such as Sooty Grouse (
 <italic class="italic">Dendragapus fuliginosus</italic>) and increased predation pressure from generalist predators such as ravens, particularly around nest sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. This potential replacement of an alpine specialist with generalist competitors and increased predators corresponds to recent findings in Europe, where local species assemblages are increasingly composed of native habitat generalists [
