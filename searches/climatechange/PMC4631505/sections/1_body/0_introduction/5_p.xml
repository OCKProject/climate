 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] modeled the relationships between 44 climate variables and the distribution of 16 biogeoclimatic zones in British Columbia. They found that the Coastal Mountain-heather Alpine zone, upon which VIWTP primarily depend, is predicted to decline by nearly 50% by the 2080s based on a single consensus map that incorporated 20 climate change scenarios, with near total loss predicted for Vancouver Island. They predict alpine ecosystems will be replaced by Coastal Western Hemlock forests, potentially resulting in increased forest productivity and carbon sequestration at the expense of habitat for alpine specialist species [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Survey efforts combined with museum records and other historic sources revealed that VIWTP still occupied the same mountains on Vancouver Island in 2004 as they had occupied historically (early to mid-1900s; [
 <xref rid="pone.0142110.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]). However, this study was coarse in scale and did not examine the effects of climate or topography on ptarmigan habitat. As climate change accelerates, adequate conservation of VIWTP will ultimately depend on detailed knowledge of the amount and configuration of suitable breeding habitat predicted under current and future climates.
