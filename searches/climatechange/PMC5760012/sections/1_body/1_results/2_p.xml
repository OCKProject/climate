<p class="p">The individual functional groups at trophic level 2 and trophic level 3 showed variable responses to warming and acidification. For example, functional groups such as meiobenthos, copepods, small epifaunal invertebrates, and filter feeders experienced significantly lower energy flow from trophic level 1 to trophic level 2 under warming (

Furthermore, warming significantly reduced the capacity of transferring energy flows of omnivorous, filter feeding, and benthic carnivorous fish, while benthic carnivorous and carnivorous fish experienced an increase in flow under acidification from trophic level 2 to trophic level 3 (
