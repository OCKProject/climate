<p class="p">Energy flows were calculated for different trophic levels following [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>], where—for example—if a group obtains 40% of its food as an herbivore and 60% as a carnivore, the corresponding fractions of the flow through the group are attributed to the herbivore level and the carnivore level, respectively. The relative flows (these are proportions adding up to 1) were converted to absolute amounts and shown as the net amount of energy that flows to higher trophic levels through consumption (g/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/month). The ‘transfer efficiency’ is the percentage of trophic flows at trophic level 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> that is converted into flows at level 
 <italic class="italic">n + 1</italic>. The transfer efficiency of a given trophic level (trophic level = 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>) not only depends on the available energy at a given trophic level (trophic level = n) but also the standing biomass at the next trophic level (trophic level = 
 <italic class="italic">n + 1</italic>). The transfer efficiencies between successive discrete trophic levels were calculated as the sum of the flow that is transferred from any given level to the next higher level, plus exports from the original level relative to the throughput (or input) of the given (originating) trophic level [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. The throughput is the sum of all flows (such as consumption, export, respiration, and flows to detritus) in a given trophic level and represents the ‘size of the trophic level in terms of flow’ [
