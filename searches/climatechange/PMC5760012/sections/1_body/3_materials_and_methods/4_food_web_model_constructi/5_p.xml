 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. We measured net productivity and respiration in each mesocosm and used them to estimate the transfer efficiency between trophic level 1 and 2 for each mesocosm food web [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. The initial output for both energy flow and transfer efficiency was obtained for discrete trophic levels I to V. However, for the simplicity of the model output and better visualization, we pooled the data for trophic levels III to Vand showed this as 1 integrated trophic level (i.e., trophic level 3).
