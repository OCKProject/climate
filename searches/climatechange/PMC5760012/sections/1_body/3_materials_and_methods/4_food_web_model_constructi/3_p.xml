<p class="p">Flow and transfer efficiency were based on the trophic aggregation routine [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] that aggregates the entire system into discrete trophic levels sensu [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The discrete trophic levels start with level I, corresponding to the primary producers and the nonliving, detrital compartments. Strict herbivores or detritivores consequently occupy a position of level II. This is followed by higher-order consumers that are allocated to several discrete trophic positions according to the type and amounts of food that reach them along feeding pathways.
