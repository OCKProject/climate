<p class="p">We built mass-balanced food web models. Trophic links were weighted by material fluxes among functional groups using Ecopath [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. We modelled energy or mass flow over a 4 month time step based on local summer conditions today and in the future. We then converted and expressed the model produced energy flow results from the experimental period to values/month to make it more comparable to other systems.
