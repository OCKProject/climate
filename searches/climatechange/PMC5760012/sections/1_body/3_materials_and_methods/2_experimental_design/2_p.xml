<p class="p">Rocky reefs consisted of natural rocks collected in situ and included attached macrophytes dominated by an assemblage of fucoids (Order Fucales; mainly species belonging to the families Fucaceae and Sargassaceae) and benthic invertebrates. Rocks were selected to be as similar as possible in terms of presence and cover of major fucoid species. Seagrass habitat was mimicked by artificial green polypropylene ribbon harbouring epiphytes and planted into fine silica sand at a depth of 6 cm. The seagrass habitat resembled the most abundant local seagrass

The circular ‘rocky reef' patches and ‘artificial seagrass’ patches were of equal size (0.42 m diameter). The space in between and around these patches was ‘open sand’ habitat, comprising fine silica sand with a depth range between 6–25 cm. The open sand and sand within the seagrass patches were additionally seeded with 0.025 m
