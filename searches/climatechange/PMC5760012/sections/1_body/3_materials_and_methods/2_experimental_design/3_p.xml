<p class="p">Fish and invertebrates were introduced into the mesocosm and represented different feeding guilds (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003446.s015" class="xref">S6 Table</xref> for a list of species associated with the mesocosms, their stocking density, and mean sizes). The fishes were selected based on their high local juvenile abundances in shallow coastal waters during summer, while the gastropods came from the rocks used to build the rocky reef patches and were redistributed evenly among all mesocosms. In the flow-through system, unfiltered seawater from 1.5 km off-shore and 8 m depth continuously supplied nutrients and planktonic propagules to each mesocosm at 2,300 L day
