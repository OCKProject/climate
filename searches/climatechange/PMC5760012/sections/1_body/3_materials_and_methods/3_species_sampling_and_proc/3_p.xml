<p class="p">Phytobenthos biomass was measured using the same benthic samplers as above. Two samplers were placed in each mesocosm for biomass measurements. A micro-spatula was used to carefully scrape the thin phytobenthic layer from the upper surface (approximately 1 mm thick) of the sand. The remaining sand was filtered through a pre-combusted and pre-weighed Whatman GF/C glass fiber filters to determine the detritus biomass. In the laboratory, photosynthetic pigments were extracted from freeze-dried sand samples (0.3–0.6 g) with 10 ml 90% acetone. After 48 hours of darkness at –20°C, the samples were stirred in a vortex, centrifuged at 3,500 rpm for 15 minutes, and extracts were analyzed in a 6,405 UV/Vis, Jenway spectrophotometer and their concentration calculated [
