<p class="p">The effects of warming and ocean acidification on food web properties (response variables: absolute energy flow, transfer efficiency, and standing biomass) were analysed using two-way ANOVAs. Both climate factors were treated as fixed and orthogonal. Before analysis, normality was checked for all response variables using the Shapiro-Wilk test, and homogeneity of variances was assessed using a Leveneâ€™s test as well as by evaluating plots of residuals against predicted values. Response variables were log
