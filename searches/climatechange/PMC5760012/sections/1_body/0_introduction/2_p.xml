<p class="p">Marine ecosystem functioning is maintained by the flow of energy from primary producers at the base of food webs through intermediate consumers to top predators, as well as via cycling of materials such as nutrients within the ecosystem [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Disturbances such as habitat modification can decouple, alter, or concentrate energy flows towards a smaller number of species and erode resilience by removing alternative feeding pathways in the food web [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. This can drive trophic food webs to shift states and potentially collapse [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In this context, climate change can independently affect, or synergistically amplify, the effect of other disturbances such as habitat degradation, species overexploitation, and species invasions [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This can reconfigure future food webs through major structural changes, like shifts in the number of trophic groups and links that connect species at the top of the food chain to basal species, which can result in altered flows of energy and shifts in the biomass of key functional groups, leading to biodiversity loss, with potentially serious implications for ecosystem functioning [
