<p class="p">We did a community-level manipulation of a temperate marine food web, consisting of 17 functional groups (ranging from primary producers to herbivores to carnivores across 3 broad trophic levels). We maintained these groups in an indoor mesocosm experiment divided into 4 treatments: elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">OA</italic>), elevated temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>), elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature (
 <italic class="italic">OAT</italic>), and ambient controls (present-day levels of 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature), each with 3 replicate mesocosms per treatment. We achieved an elevated 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> of approximately 900 ppm (pH = 7.89) and warming of +2.8Â°C, which represent the conditions predicted for the end of this century, following a business-as-usual emission scenario (RCP8.5) [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The Ecopath model is built on a system of linear equations and creates a static mass-balanced snapshot of the resources in a given ecosystem according to biomass estimates and food consumption relationships of functional groups that represent the organisms in a food web. The quantitative description of food web properties is essential to advance our understanding of ecosystem structure and functioning at a community level [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Using the Ecopath approach, we tested whether: (1) global warming and ocean acidification enhance energy fluxes through bottom-up effects that stimulate primary productivity, or (2) global warming and ocean acidification allow opportunistc groups to proliferate and divert productivity into alternative pathways, as well as (3) biomass of lower trophic levels and detritus will dominate the future structure of marine food webs due to reduced energy transfer efficiencies to higher trophic levels. We also test whether synergies between ocean acidification and increasing temperature are likely to amplify the effect of global warming on marine ecosystems. Thus, through a combination of experimental and modelling approaches, we provide new evidence for altered energy flow (biomass fluxes) and transfer efficiency through food webs due to global change stressors, which is crucial for understanding the potential effects of climate change on marine food web structure and functioning.
