<p class="p">The survival of a species or a group of species in an ecosystem depends on how well they respond to dynamic changes in productivity, in terms of direction (i.e., positive or negative) and strength. However, the responses of species to global change are not individual-based; they are connected through biotic interactions within and across trophic levels [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Importantly, the energy flow (biomass fluxes) to higher trophic levels is determined by various biological interactions (e.g., predatorâ€“prey relationships, competition, facilitation, and mutualism) of species that are directly or indirectly linked to proximate trophic levels [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. For example, climate change can weaken the energy transfer efficiency between primary producers and consumers by reducing feeding performance with potential impacts further up the food chain [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Although ocean warming and acidification can boost basal productivity [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], it does not necessarily result in an increase in secondary productivity [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The propagation of production through trophic levels could be modified by food chain length [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] or with an increase in the dominance of herbivory-resistant primary producers [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Cyanobacteria, in the form of toxin-producing deleterious phytoplankton, can potentially divert productivity into alternate food web pathways, which are unavailable to higher trophic levels. Cyanobacteria have been forecast to increase in dominance as a result of global warming [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Conversely, in line with metabolic theory [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], increased food demand in predators can intensify top-down control of their prey populations [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], influencing body size-driven metabolic differences in food web structure [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Thus, a dichotomy between enhanced bottom up control through an increase in herbivory-resistant primary producers and enhanced top-down control due to higher metabolism-driven energetic demand in predators can jeopardise intermediate trophic levels and weaken food web stability. Such a mismatch can alter trophic energy flow dynamics [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], with the consequences expected to be greater in food webs with three trophic levels or more [
