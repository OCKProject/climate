<p class="p">Forecasting the effect of global change on ecosystem functioning is a major challenge in ecology [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], partly because future climate shifts are likely to reorganize complex food webs, generating novel communities composed of new combinations of species [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. In marine ecosystems, multiple anthropogenic stressors are already eroding biodiversity by changing the composition of species [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and affecting rates of biomass transfer through ecological networks, resulting in altered food web organisation and dynamics [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. While overexploitation is largely responsible for altering the structure and functioning of many ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], global warming is forecast to amplify these effects, having serious consequences for the health and sustainability of marine ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Despite many studies showing a potential detrimental effect of climate change on biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], we still lack a strong and coherent theoretical and empirical foundation for understanding how species communities are likely to respond to global change [
