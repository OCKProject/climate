<p class="p">One of the weaknesses of earlier applications of the Ecopath model were assumptions of ‘steady-state’ or equilibrium conditions, meaning that the model outputs should only be considered for the period across which the model input parameters are deemed valid [

Ecopath modelling approaches now no longer assume steady-state conditions but instead the model parameterizations are based on a mass-balance assumption over a chosen arbitrary period. The mass-balance approach in Ecopath filters for mutually incompatible estimates of flow [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Moreover, under the Ecopath modelling approach, we assumed that mortality for a prey equals consumption of a predator and that all prey are equal in terms of energetic content. Additional care needs to be taken when inferences are drawn from ecosystem models built for highly dynamic systems due to likely nonlinearities in important food web properties of some functional groups, operating at fine temporal scales. Nevertheless, since we used multiple sampling points through time and averages based on multiple replicates for our model input, especially for taxonomic groups that have the potential to show large oscillations with environmental fluctuations, the model outputs are likely to be indicative of near-future ecological states. Lastly, model outputs were tested using the PREBAL diagnostic and pedigree index (see Supplementary Methods for details on model and data quality), and confirmed a stable model that is ecologically robust.
