<p class="p">Metabolic theory suggests that consumers will show a greater response to temperature than producers [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesised a priori that warming would drive an increase in metabolic and consumption rates for macroinvertebrates in our experiment. However, reduced food availability, brought about by palatable types of turf algae being replaced by unpalatable cyanobacteria, caused food limitation, preventing increased metabolic rates for macroinvertebrates at higher temperatures, suppressing the flow of energy to the second trophic level [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Furthermore, biomass of major prey groups such as copepods, small epifaunal invertebrates, and filter feeders, which largely form the diet of consumers at the third trophic level, collapsed under the warming treatments, resulting in significantly less energy available for the third trophic level. One of the reasons for this collapse is an excessive predation pressure on primary consumers by species at the third trophic level (i.e., predators) due to their higher energetic demand [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], which was not matched by any increase in productivity rates of primary consumers under warming. Alternatively, under warming, the consumer–producer relationship at the base of the food web could be nonsynchronous if consumption rates of herbivores peak earlier than the growth rates of producers, creating a mismatch between production and consumption [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This means that under certain conditions, even in the absence of herbivory-resistant primary producers, warming-induced metabolic stress of organisms can effectively decouple the consumer–producer relationship if consumer metabolism and consumption cannot keep pace with increasing production.
