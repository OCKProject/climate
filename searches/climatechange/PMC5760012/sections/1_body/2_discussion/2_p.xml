<p class="p">Our current inability to capture more realistic features of food web responses to global climate change is mostly due to a reliance on short-term, small-scale experiments harbouring single species and lower trophic levels, which provide an ambiguous approximation of naturally complex food webs [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Moreover, few studies of ecological responses to climate change include predatorâ€“prey dynamics and competitive interactions or allow for the potential proliferation of opportunistic groups of species, all of which can greatly influence or reverse many of the predicted responses of species and communities to climate change [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In contrast, our experimental results account for complex multispecies interactions and biotic processes, providing an improved representation of natural systems and how these are likely to respond to global warming [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Our experimental data provide insights into how anthropogenic climate change can potentially affect food web dynamics for relatively short-lived taxa. This is because large scale mesocosm experiments such as ours bridge the gap between simplified experimental conditions and the real world [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], providing important opportunities to better understand the likely mechanisms by which primary productivity under certain future climate conditions propagates through the food web.
