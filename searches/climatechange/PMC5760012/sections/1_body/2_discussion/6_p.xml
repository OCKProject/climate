<p class="p">The replacement of turf algae by cyanobacteria further resulted in a more detritus-based food web under warming. Detritus can be very important for sustaining food webs and ecosystem stability [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. We show (based on the Finn's cycling index) that warming significantly reduced the detritus recycling capacity of the system. The inability of herbivores to consume enhanced primary producer biomass and the simultaneous failure of detritivores to transfer excessive detritus production to the successive trophic levels resulted in an accumulation of detrital biomass at the base of the food chain. Therefore, warming-induced detritus accumulation, as observed in our study, might have far-reaching ecosystem consequences for future oceans, such as the spreading of ‘dead zones’ through increased microbial activity and consumption of dissolved oxygen in bottom waters [
