<p class="p">In summary, our results suggest that warming has the capacity to drive an energetic collapse at the base of marine food webs, and this effect can propagate to higher trophic levelsâ€”subsequently leading to a collapse in species biomass of the entire food web. The underlying mechanism for this collapse is the replacement of preferred turf algae by cyanobacterial biomass that drives the system towards food limitation for herbivores, with detrimental effects on their predators, combined with a switch towards a less efficient detritus-driven system. Several studies have reported an apparent increase in the occurrence of cyanobacteria in marine waters globally as a result of increasing temperatures [

Thus, these findings are particularly important in the context of climate change, as mismatches in trophic dynamics can decouple linkages between trophic levels driving ecosystems towards simplified, less productive systems, with cascading effects on ecosystem resilience and functioning.
