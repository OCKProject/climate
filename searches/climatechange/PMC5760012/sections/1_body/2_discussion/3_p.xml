<p class="p">Increased standing biomass in our benthic mesocosm experiment was most evident for cyanobacteria under warming (irrespective of acidification). Warming is known to enhance the primary productivity of some taxa, particularly of weedy species such as turf algae [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Cyanobacteria form a major component of turf algae [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] and are predicted to proliferate and expand under eutrophication and climate change [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The potential for cyanobacterial dominance in turf algal assemblages under future warming and acidification has been demonstrated previously using experimental approaches [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. The effect of warming sea temperatures is expected to be greater in areas that are shallow and nutrient rich [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], providing ideal environmental conditions for cyanobacteria to invade other benthic primary producer groups [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Some cyanobacteria are known to be toxic and cause localized anoxia and mortality in marine organisms [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Cyanobacteria also produce potent allelochemicals that deter feeding and are difficult to control by grazers [
 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Herbivores like macroinvertebrates and small epifaunal invertebrates predominantly feed on mat-forming turf algae rather than cyanobacteria.
