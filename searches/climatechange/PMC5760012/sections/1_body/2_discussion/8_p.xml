<p class="p">Although we used one of the most complex benthic mesocosm experiments to date, our approach is not devoid of caveats. For example, difficulties in separating the functional roles of turf and cyanobacteria meant that they were modelled as one functional group ‘mat-forming algae’. In our model, we did not consider regular bacteria (other than cyanobacteria) as a separate functional group, but rather considered them under detritus. Thus, detritivores are considered to mainly feed on detritus and its associated bacteria. We opted for not using an extra bacterial compartment because bacteria would largely overshadow any other trophic flows of the system [

Our study showed a relatively larger biomass flux between trophic levels 1 to 2 compared to between trophic levels 2 and 3 due to the presence of relatively large-bodied primary consumers (such as herbivorous macroinvertebrates:

The presence of a wider range of higher-order invertebrate predators, as is the case in natural ecosystems, would have reduced this disproportionally high flux between primary producers and primary consumers by stronger top-down control. However, since the focus of our study was to show relative difference among the climate treatments, the results still provide a valuable quantitative insight into the potential future of some benthic marine ecosystem under two co-occurring global climate stressors.
