<p class="p">Our study provides strong empirical evidence that global warming has the capacity to drive a collapse in marine food webs by altering energy flows between successive trophic levels. In our ecologically complex benthic mesocosm experiment, the combination of warming and acidification enhanced the biomass of primary producers, but reduced energy flow to herbivores, while warming (irrespective of acidification) reduced energy flow to carnivores at higher trophic levels. Warming also decreased the trophic transfer efficiency between primary producers and herbivores, consequently reducing standing biomass of herbivores and carnivores. Other studies based on the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE) [

 <xref rid="pbio.2003446.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In our case, the combination of warming and acidification decoupled increased basal productivity from herbivore production, while warming in isolation reduced predator production, making most of the primary production unavailable further up the food chain. Thus, energy from enhanced primary producer biomass under future climate conditions may not always transfer through to successive trophic levels, but instead can decouple food demand and supply. Such a decoupling may alter dietary preferences of consumers, modifying consumerâ€“prey relationships within food webs.
