  <title class="title">PREBAL of the control and acidification models plotting (a) biomass estimates (gWWm
   <sup class="sup">âˆ’2</sup>), (b) production/biomass ratio (per 4 months), and (c) consumption/biomass (per 4 months) on a log scale versus functional groups ranked by their trophic level, from lowest to highest trophic level.
  </title>
  <p class="p">A constant of 1 was added to all response variables to avoid some negative values (Log
   <sub class="sub">10</sub> [
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> + 1]) prior to PREBAL plotting. For specific functional group name, refer to the legend. Herb. = herbivorous. PREBAL is shown only for base models that are built on the average of all the input parameters (B, P/B, Q/B) across mesocosms within each climate treatment. B, biomass; P/B, production per unit of biomass; Q/B, consumption per unit of biomass.
