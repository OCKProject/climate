  <title class="title">The different structural components of the mesocosm used for this experiment.</title>
  <p class="p">Each mesocosm comprises 4 ‘rocky reef’ patches (A) and 4 ‘artificial seagrass’ patches (B). The space in between and around these patches was considered ‘open sand’ habitat (C). The incoming seawater was led into 2 header tanks (800 L) at the beginning of the flow-through facilities, and from there gravity-fed into each mesocosm (D). The header tank was preconditioned to future

In addition, continuous water circulation (approximately 1,800 L per hour) was maintained between each mesocosm and a 60-L supporting bin positioned next to each mesocosm that was bubbled heavily with enriched air at 1,000 ppm

A diffuser pipe was used to generate a mild circular current inside the mesocosms using the water exchange between supporting bin and mesocosm and alternating direction every 6 hours (E). A filter column (approximately 20 μm) allowed water to flow back into the 60-L bin by gravity (F) and ensured that larger organisms were always retained within the mesocosms. In summary, this technically complex set-up ensured a mesocosm environment without unnatural disturbances such as pump noise, air bubbles, or electrical currents. A 250W metal halide lamp (Osram Powerstar HQI-T 250/D/PRO) mounted just above the mesocosm (G) ensured an irradiance that corresponded to approximately 6–7 m water depth in Gulf St. Vincent (Phillips et al. 1981).
