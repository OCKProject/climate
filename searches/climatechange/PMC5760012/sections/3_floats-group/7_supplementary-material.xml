  <title class="title">Variability in pH and temperature over the 5-month study period.</title>
  <p class="p">This includes 3 phases: 1) the first week of the acclimation period, 2) the progressive elevation to treatment levels, and 3) at maintained treatment levels. Mean Â± SD are shown based on 3 mesocosms for each treatment. pH and temperature were both measured once daily in each mesocosm around midday.</p>
