  <title class="title">Living biomass of primary producers (trophic level 1), primary consumers (level 2), and secondary consumers (level 3) across functional groups within the mesocosms.</title>
  <p class="p">The biomass of functional groups with intermediate trophic levels (e.g., trophic level of filter feeders = 2.4) was assigned to the levels 2 and 3 according to their relative contribution to trophic flow (e.g., 60% to level 2 and 40% to level 3). At the third trophic level, the decrease in biomass under T and OAT is primarily driven by filter feeders, while a negative effect was not apparent in most other functional groups such as the fishes (see 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003446.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Living biomass includes 16 functional groups excluding detritus. Values are means Â± SE across mesocosms (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3). Significant interactions or main effects (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) within trophic levels are based on two-way ANOVAs (df = 1,8) and are indicated with asterisks. See 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003446.s011" class="xref">S2 Table</xref> for statistical test outcomes. Means with different lowercase letters indicate significant difference among treatments based on posthoc tests corrected for false discovery rate and done separately for different trophic levels. C, control; OA, elevated CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, OAT, elevated CO
