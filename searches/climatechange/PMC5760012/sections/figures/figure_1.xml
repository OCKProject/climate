  <title class="title">The effects of future climate on absolute flows and transfer efficiency between successive trophic levels of the mesocosm food web.</title>
  <p class="p">Absolute flows, shown as line diagrams, refer to the total amount of energy that flows to higher trophic levels through consumption (log10 g Wet Weight/m
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>/month) aggregated by trophic level. The first trophic level shows flows originating from both the primary producers and detritus, which are transferred to the second and third trophic level through consumption by herbivores and carnivores, respectively. Transfer efficiency, presented as bar charts, refer to the ratio at which absolute flows are transferred from one trophic level to the next. Mean Â± SE are based on 
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3 mesocosms. Significant effects (
   <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) within trophic levels are based on two-way ANOVAs (df = 1,8) and are indicated with asterisks. See 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003446.s010" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> for statistical test outcomes. Means with different lower-case letters indicate significant differences among treatments based on posthoc tests corrected for false discovery rate and done separately for different trophic levels. The distribution of organisms within the mesocosms is reflected as their vertical position inside the graph (ranging from the bottom of the mesocosm to the surface of the water column). Species cliparts were obtained or modified from Openclipart (
