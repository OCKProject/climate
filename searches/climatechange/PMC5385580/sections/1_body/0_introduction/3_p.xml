<p class="p">The EU funded Urban Reduction in Greenhouse Gas Emissions in China and Europe (URGENCHE) project's incorporation of city policy makers, as well as leading academics, enabled the development of our understanding of how greenhouse gas reduction policies impact living conditions. Via expert opinion and extensive literature review, the following mitigation policies were identified: raising buildings' energy efficiency to reduce need for heating (
