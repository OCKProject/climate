<p class="p">Outdoor transport, air pollution and greenspace were explored. Main transport mode was established by asking whether respondents made most of their journeys by car/motorbike/moped, public transport, bike, walk or other in winter and in summer. Opinion on air quality was established by asking whether respondents agreed or disagreed with the following statements: ‘some air quality should be sacrificed for faster economic development’, ‘GHG should be reduced in Kuopio’, ‘Kuopio should promote renewable energy for heating of buildings’, ‘district heating is the greenest domestic heating’, ‘increase biofuels for district heating for environmental reasons, even though it is more expensive’, ‘increase wood domestic heating to reduce GHG ‘, ‘wood burning causes air pollution so don't increase’, ‘biofuels for cars reduce greenhouse gas emissions’, ‘biofuels cause problems in the countries where they are grown’, ‘Kuopio should encourage use of biofuels in traffic’ and ‘air pollution has not been noticeable in the past 2 weeks’. Respondents were asked how often on average they spent their free time in nature.</p>
