<p class="p">We approached resilience chiefly through the concept of ontological security: a long term sense of feeling secure in oneself which allows oneself to deal with life's challenges (

 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hiscock et al., 2001</xref>). All items are answered on a 5 part Likert scale. The items linked to protection are ‘I can deal with stress’ and ‘I feel safe’; the items linked to control are ‘I feel in control’ and ‘I can do what I want, when I want’; the items linked to being valued are ‘most people would like a life like mine’ and ‘I feel I'm doing well in life’ and items linked to response to change are ‘my life has a sense of routine’, ‘I worry about things going wrong’ (reversed), ‘I enjoy a challenge’ and ‘I'm frightened of change’ (reversed).
