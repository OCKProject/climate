<p id="Par33" class="p">An effective naming strategy hinges on the 
 <italic class="italic">credibility</italic> of the organization that could name noncompliance and the 
 <italic class="italic">reliability</italic> of the information that substantiates the naming. If states would be the parties that would 
 <italic class="italic">name</italic> the noncommitting corporations, the issue of credibility does not seem to be a problem here.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16" class="xref">16</xref> Things become more complicated when it comes to the reliability of the information, since in a voluntary approach the information is based on self-assessments of corporations; a robust verification mechanism based one external audits seems to be indispensable here. There are two potential problems here. First, if we want shaming—as the next step that must follow naming—to be an effective strategy, the results of the external audits must become public. This could, in turn, make it more difficult for corporations to commit to such external audits. The relevant literature shows that corporations submit more readily to external audits if they know that the reports are not going to be public (e.g. Potoski and Prakash

 <italic class="italic">selective disclosure</italic>, as defined by Marquis et al. (Forthcoming) as “a symbolic strategy whereby firms seek to gain or maintain legitimacy by disproportionately revealing beneficial or relatively benign performance indicators to obscure their less impressive overall performance.” This problem emphasizes the need for clear and unified measurement, monitoring and verification practices, such that the final outcome could rule out selective disclosure. In sum, for naming to be possible, a robust measurement, monitoring and verification mechanism is needed to ensure the reliability and quality of the information provided in corporations’ self-assessments.
