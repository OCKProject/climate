 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Moral Legitimacy of Shaming as a Strategy</xref>” deals with the issue of moral legitimacy of such commitment based voluntary approaches. One might argue that approaches based on voluntary commitments (and shaming the one who would not comply) might blur the fundamental moral obligations and are, therefore, ethically illegitimate. In this section, we will investigate the nature of moral obligations of corporations and the legitimacy of replacing such obligations with voluntary based approaches such as the one presented in this paper. We argue that the effectiveness and legitimacy questions are closely tied together; provided that such voluntary based (quasi-judicial) approaches are the only alternative to legally imposed duties, they are most morally defensible if they would indeed be most effective in reducing the harmful GHGs. Section “
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Moral Legitimacy of Shaming as a Strategy</xref>” further discusses the ethical limitations and pitfalls of voluntary approaches. Section “
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Discussions and Conclusions: Under Certain Conditions, Shaming Could Work</xref>” presents our conclusions.
