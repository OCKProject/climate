  <p id="Par7" class="p">In the international relations literature, naming and shaming has been thought to shape or change states’ behaviour. It is a strategy frequently used by human rights organizations; see, for instance, various contributions in (Friman 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2015c</xref>). This paper, however, asks how shaming could incentivize corporations to comply with the targets set forth in the Paris Agreement.

  <p id="Par10" class="p">A quasi-judicial mechanism is essentially judicial in character but it is not within the officially defined judicial power as for instance defined in constitutions. An important feature of a quasi-judicial mechanism is that there is no need to have a 
   <italic class="italic">de facto</italic> judge in the procedure, meaning that arbitrators or even scientific experts may perform as deciding authorities. Another important difference with judicial mechanism is that quasi-judiciary mechanisms often lack an enforcement mechanism; naming and shaming or other punitive actions such as suspension or termination of non-compliant parties' conventional rights seem to be the surrogate for actual legal enforcement. In section “
   <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Effectiveness of Shaming as a Strategy: Governmental and Non-governmental Approaches</xref>”, we discuss several examples of quasi-judicial mechanism in discussions on Corporate Social Responsibility and environmental management.

   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2015c</xref>). While most contributions in this book are about the role of naming and shaming in international relations, the basic rationale of the arguments applies to the type of naming and shaming as discussed in this paper too.

  <p id="Par34" class="p">We are assuming that states will not wrongfully ‘name’ a corporation, for instance in order to cover their own failure or incompetence. While this possibility exists, it seems unlikely that states would often undertake any ‘naming and shaming’ activity at all because of their unwillingness (race to the bottom) and inability (in case of less powerful states). So, the issue of the credibility of the organization (other than states) that does the ‘naming’ remains a concern.</p>

  <p id="Par37" class="p">The Brent Spar case is a special case in that Shell seemed to have sufficient scientific evidence that their original proposal was the one that should have been preferred from an environmental point of view. Greenpeace suffered some reputation damage afterwards because their scientific evidence seemed to be flawed. We did include this example nonetheless because this case study seems to mark an important moment in which “major reputation sensitive companies” realized the power of shaming that could be “unleashed upon them by NGOs” (Gunningham 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2009</xref>, 196).

However, when we agree that there are moral obligations but instead of turning those into legal obligations we leave the fulfilment of these moral obligations to voluntary approaches, it does require a reflection on the legitimacy of such voluntary approaches. This section deals with that question of legitimacy.</p>
