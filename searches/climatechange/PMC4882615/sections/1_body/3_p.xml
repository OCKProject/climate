<p class="p">Here we present a full factorial experimental test of the effects of rising winter temperature and shortening winter length on survival and body mass change of hibernating juveniles of an anuran amphibian of the temperate zone, the European common toad (
 <italic class="italic">Bufo bufo</italic>). We performed the experiment on a set of toadlets we had reared under controlled semi-natural conditions using mesocosms during the larval stage and outdoor enclosures after metamorphosis. In this way we controlled for individual variation in genetic relatedness and environmental conditions during early ontogeny that can have carry-over effects after metamorphosis

We hibernated toadlets at current (1.5 °C) or elevated (4.5 °C) hibernation temperature in combination with current (91 days) or shortened (61 days) hibernation length. We weighed toadlets and documented mortality one week after termination of hibernation (
