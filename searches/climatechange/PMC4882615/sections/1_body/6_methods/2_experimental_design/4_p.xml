<p class="p">We randomly selected 372 individuals out of 403 survivors and assigned 93 toadlets randomly to each of the four hibernation scenarios, while balancing for body mass, larval environment, family and enclosure (for details see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The simulated current average hibernation temperature of 1.5 °C is well within the natural range experienced by common toads during winter
