<p class="p">We transferred metamorphosing toadlets into slightly tilted 45 L boxes containing egg boxes as shelter, and fed them 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> with springtails (
 <italic class="italic">Folsomia</italic> sp.), woodlice (
 <italic class="italic">Trichorhina tomentosa</italic>), fruit flies (
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila hydei</italic>) and hatchling crickets (
 <italic class="italic">Gryllodes sigillatus</italic>). After all individuals metamorphosed, we transported them to the Konrad Lorenz Institute of Ethology, Vienna, Austria. We marked toadlets of 10 families individually by toe-clipping, a method widely used for marking of anuran amphibians
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>, and assigned them randomly to 16 outdoor enclosures (set up similar to
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>). Each enclosure received one toadlet from each family by larval environment combination, resulting in 50 animals per enclosure.
