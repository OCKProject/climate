<p class="p">We initiated hibernation on 10 November 2015 by relocating toadlets into two laboratory refrigerators with forced air convection (Pol-Eko-Aparatura, Wodzisław Śląski, Poland). We recorded temperature hourly using data loggers (Onset, Cape Cod, MA, USA; for measured temperatures see

Once a week we sprinkled aged tap water into tubes to prevent desiccation and relocated tubes within refrigerators haphazardly to account for spatial variation in temperature. Sixty-one and 91 days after initiation of hibernation, we transferred toadlets from both 1.5 and 4.5 °C to a refrigerator set to 7.5 °C (
