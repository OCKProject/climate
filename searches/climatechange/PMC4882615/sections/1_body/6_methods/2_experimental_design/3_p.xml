<p class="p">We recaptured toadlets from enclosures on 14–15 October and let them defecate in groups of 15–20 individuals in 45 L plastic outdoor containers filled with moist leaves to prevent desiccation. On 17 October after individual identification and measuring their body mass to the nearest mg, we transferred each toadlet separately into a 50 ml centrifuge tube (11.5 cm × 3 cm, length × diameter) filled with 20 ml of a 1:1 mixture of sterilized and dried (2 hours at 170 °C) soil and sand moistened with 5 ml aged tap water to allow burying and prevent desiccation. Tubes were covered with a mosquito net to allow air transfer and stored in a close to horizontal position (~5°). Toadlets had only a limited space available to move around during the experiment, but not much more may be available to animals in natural hibernacula
