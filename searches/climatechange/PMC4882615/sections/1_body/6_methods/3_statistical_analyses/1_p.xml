<p class="p">We analyzed survival using generalized linear mixed-effects modeling procedures with binomial error distribution and logit link function. Effects on post-hibernation body mass were evaluated using general linear mixed-effects models. Mass was log

 <italic class="italic">P-</italic>values (α = 0.05), testing the main effects of larval environment, hibernation length and hibernation temperature as fixed factors, body mass before hibernation as a covariate, tadpole family and enclosure as crossed random factors, and all testable two- and three-way interactions among fixed effects, including the covariate. We used a forward model-selection approach to ensure a standardized method of analysis for all studied response variables, since some interactions with larval environment could not be estimated for survival because in some subgroups there was no variance (all individuals survived or died,
