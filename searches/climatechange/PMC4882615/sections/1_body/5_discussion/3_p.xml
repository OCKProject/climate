<p class="p">In conclusion, under simulated current hibernation conditions in our study 67% of toadlets survived, which is within the range of overwintering survival estimated for natural conditions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>, whereas under simulated climate change conditions survival was close to 100% one week after hibernation. Moreover, when exposed to a shorter and/or milder winter, survivors also had larger body mass after hibernation, which is likely to have long-lasting effects by enhancing further survival and fecundity

While other consequences of climate change, such as an increasing probability of mass mortalities in aquatic larvae due to premature pond-desiccation, the spread of invasive predators and infectious diseases are likely to have negative effects on anuran populations located in the temperate zone and at high altitudes and latitudes

Further studies testing the general applicability of our results across several amphibian taxa, under different climate change scenarios and during several life stages are urgently needed. These investigations will deliver important insights regarding the expected effects of future climate change on amphibians, allowing the design and execution of informed and effective conservation actions protecting this highly threatened group of animals.
