<p class="p">Body mass after hibernation was very similar among toadlets hibernating for 61 days, regardless of temperature, and was higher than in animals hibernating for 91 days. This may have simply resulted from a shorter time period without food intake pertaining smaller loss of body mass. On the other hand, low temperatures seemed to enhance the negative effects of a long hibernation period. Glycogen and lipids are the main energy source for amphibians during hibernation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. Although there is no direct evidence that common toads can harness glycogen this way, they can survive subzero temperatures of −3 °C for up to 22 hours
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. Thus, one possible contributor to the observed pattern may be that toadlets hibernating at 1.5 °C depleted their energy reserves twofold: by maintaining normal physiological functions and also deploying glycogen as a response to low temperature. Body mass before hibernation was also positively related to survival and post-hibernation mass, which is in accordance with results of a previous field-based study on juvenile anurans

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref> did not find a significant effect of hibernation regime and mass before hibernation on proportional mass change of toadlets during hibernation, perhaps because overwintering conditions were benign in all of their scenarios (see above). Also, while in our study T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> was −0.77 °C, already low enough to trigger physiological mechanisms preventing freezing, Garner, 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref> never exposed toads to temperatures approaching or below 0 °C (T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> was 4 °C), rendering the production of cryoprotective agents unnecessary.
