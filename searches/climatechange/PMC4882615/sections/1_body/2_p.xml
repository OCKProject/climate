<p class="p">In the Northern Hemisphere temperate zone, climate change is projected to increase low-percentile (i.e. cold) winter temperatures and decrease the duration of cold periods and snow cover

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. While amphibians are likely to benefit from shorter winters, the presumable effects of rising winter temperatures are less clear. It has been argued that milder winters could lead to amphibian declines by depleting the energy reserves of individuals due to a rise in metabolic rates and increased enzymatic activity, and negatively affecting survival and fecundity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. Other field studies, however, contradict the latter hypothesis by reporting higher mortality during winters with low and widely varying temperatures

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>), even though a sufficiently high survival rate and good body condition of juveniles are of fundamental importance for population persistence
