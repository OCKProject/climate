<p class="p">Body mass one week after hibernation was positively related to mass before hibernation (linear mixed effects model, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 36, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.90, N = 325), and negatively to hibernation length (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>): body mass of toadlets did not differ between cold and mild temperature regimes when exposed to shortened hibernation, but when toadlets were exposed to longer hibernation, animals overwintering at 4.5 °C weighed more after hibernation than toadlets that had overwintered at 1.5 °C (
