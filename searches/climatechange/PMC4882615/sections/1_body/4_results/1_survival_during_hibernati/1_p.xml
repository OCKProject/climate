<p class="p">Overall, 325 toadlets out of 371 (87.6%) survived hibernation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Overwintering survival was higher in scenarios with the higher hibernation temperature and in scenarios with shorter hibernation period (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Also, survival increased with larger body mass before hibernation (mean ± s.e.m. for survivors: 1389 ± 28.64 mg, N = 325; died: 1070 ± 52.57 mg, N = 46) and differed between larval environments (
