 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tollefson, 2013</xref>), the slowdown of the Earth’s surface temperature warming in the period 1998–2013 undermined, for a number of years, the idea that human-generated greenhouse gases are the main driver and cause of climate change ( 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nieves 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). During this period, the existing climate models were unable (on average) to reproduce the observed atmospheric temperature trend. Several theories were proposed to explain this surface temperature “hiatus”. One of the first explanations put forth was that it is normal for warming rates to plateau occasionally ( 
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trenberth, 2015</xref>). Other factors that were extensively investigated included the increased volcanic activity and the high levels of air pollution in China during the hiatus period, since atmospheric particles reflect more of the Sun’s energy back into space (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>). The ever-increasing decline in solar activity since 2000 was also considered as a possibility, since it reduces the amount of energy reaching the Earth (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Ultimately, in 2015, Nieves and colleagues showed that what was interpreted as a change in the planet’s warming rate was, in fact, a redistribution of heat within the ocean ( 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nieves 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). Specifically, Nieves 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, showed that heat moved from the surface of the Pacific Ocean to the deeper layers of the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans, a finding that was confirmed using a wealth of observational and simulated data. As a result, the net ocean heat uptake remains dangerously high ( 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nieves 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>), and the rate of global warming may have actually increased during the hiatus period (
