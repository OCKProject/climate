  <underline class="underline">Some slightly awkward phrasing persists in this article. For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph on page 2 under “Unaccounted heat in climate research” could be re-written as “Research aiming to understand the 1998-2013 hiatus significantly benefited from studies investigating the causes…”. The sentence, “This is not surprising.” Under the same heading on page 2, does not add to the paragraph and could be cut.</underline>
