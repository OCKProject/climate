  <underline class="underline">“Unaccounted heat in thermal physiology research” could benefit from some discussion of the importance of brain temperature (Kiyaktin 2010 for review1). Individuals may experience robust changes in brain temperature during behavioral activation such as manual labor or intense exercise that can result, under conditions of diminished heat dissipation, in pathological hyperthermia2. Hyperthermia increases permeability of the blood-brain barrier, predisposing individuals to the development of vasogenic edema and damage of brain cells. Increased global temperature may also pose increased health risks for people using psychomotor stimulant drugs of abuse, the effects of which are greatly potentiated by increased ambient temperature. This is critical when considering issues of heat distribution in which peripheral tissues can tolerate greater changes in heat with less threat to the health and survivability of the organism, whereas increases in specific organ structures such as the brain can threaten organism health.</underline>
