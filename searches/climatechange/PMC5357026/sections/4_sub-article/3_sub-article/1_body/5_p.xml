  <underline class="underline">The authors draw a parallel between heat distribution in human and heat distribution within climate systems throughout the piece. While I see the analogy, it might be best to reign in this comparison in some places, specifically, on page 3 under the heading “Heat parallels in the two disciplines”. While the point is well taken, the human body has many mechanisms that actively work to maintain thermo-homeostasis. The earth, on the other hand, is a passive system with no “goal temperature”, as it were. Would it be better simply to state that temperature distribution is important in both systems and that our understanding and measurements of it need to be improved in the interest of human health? Given that heat distribution in humans is dependent on the temperature of the environment, there is a strong argument to be made linking these two variables without drawing a comparison between an actively regulated homeostatic system and system in which heat distribution occurs through passive mechanisms. The first paragraph of “Unaccounted heat in thermal physiology research” contains this analogy as well.</underline>
