   <p class="p">This opinion piece touches on an important issue. It is critical to accurately measure the redistribution of heat within both climate and physiological systems. The authors correctly note the interconnectedness of the two: as the earth warms, heat-related health risks will rise as the dynamics of energy transfer between organism and environment change. Standards to protect workers and the environment should be updated to reflect the most accurate and helpful measurements and information as is possible.</p>
