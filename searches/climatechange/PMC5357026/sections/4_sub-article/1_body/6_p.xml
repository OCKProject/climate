   <p class="p">The authors put forward that the findings of Nieves 
    <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. were confirmed by increased temperatures in 2015 and 2016 (Page 2). When considering global trends, single year data is a fraught method of proof given the degree of between-year variability in temperature. By the same logic, the climate change slowdown from 1998-2013 discussed in this paper was used to justify a lack of action around climate change.

   <p class="p">Some slightly awkward phrasing persists in this article. For example, the first sentence of the second paragraph on page 2 under “Unaccounted heat in climate research” could be re-written as “Research aiming to understand the 1998-2013 hiatus significantly benefited from studies investigating the causes…”. The sentence, “This is not surprising.” Under the same heading on page 2, does not add to the paragraph and could be cut.</p>

   <p class="p">“Unaccounted heat in thermal physiology research” could benefit from some discussion of the importance of brain temperature (Kiyaktin 2010 for review

    </sup>). Individuals may experience robust changes in brain temperature during behavioral activation such as manual labor or intense exercise that can result, under conditions of diminished heat dissipation, in pathological hyperthermia

    </sup>. Hyperthermia increases permeability of the blood-brain barrier, predisposing individuals to the development of vasogenic edema and damage of brain cells. Increased global temperature may also pose increased health risks for people using psychomotor stimulant drugs of abuse, the effects of which are greatly potentiated by increased ambient temperature. This is critical when considering issues of heat distribution in which peripheral tissues can tolerate greater changes in heat with less threat to the health and survivability of the organism, whereas increases in specific organ structures such as the brain can threaten organism health.
