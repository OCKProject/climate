  <underline class="underline">The opinion article by Drâ€™s Flouris and Kenny nicely describes the similarities in the changes of heat content pattern between the Earth and the human body. The difference between these two is naturally the time frame, the response of the Earth being several years and that of the human, minutes. Given that Earth is warming, extreme heat wave episodes are increasing and the study the authors are referring to (Meade et al. 20161) points to the possibility that the existing TLV guidelines may not be sufficient in protecting labor force from excessive heat strain (as the authors state). Therefore, a re-evaluation of the current TLV guidelines might be desirable.</underline>
