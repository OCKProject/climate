  <title class="title">Amendments from Version 1</title>
  <p class="p">We wish to thank all Reviewers for their efforts in reviewing the manuscript and for their constructive and helpful comments. Following the Reviewers’ recommendations, the revised version of the paper includes: (i) information about the previous evaluations of the TLV guidelines; (ii) clarification that the Earth is a “passive system” with no active regulation of temperature or heat content; (iii) indication that heat distribution is important in both the Earth and the human body and our understanding and measurements of it need to be improved in the interest of human health; (iv) clarification that the findings of Nieves et al. were confirmed by a wealth of observational and simulated data, not by the record-breaking temperatures throughout 2015 and 2016; (v) correction of some slightly awkward phrasing; and (vi) brief comments about the effects of heat redistribution on the brain thermal homeostasis.</p>
