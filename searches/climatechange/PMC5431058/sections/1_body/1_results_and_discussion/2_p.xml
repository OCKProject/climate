<p class="p">Expansion rates at the leading edge of the range decreased significantly under increasing directional mismatching between ocean currents and thermal gradients for benthic invertebrates and algae (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), supporting our initial expectation concerning dispersion-mediated effects of flow directionality on climate-driven range expansion (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). On the other hand, we found no evidence that active dispersion offsets the negative effects of mismatched directionality for fish compared to passive dispersing taxa, though our lack of observations for the most extreme directional mismatch category for fish limits our inference. Nevertheless, and though flow-dependency is arguably most important for the redistribution of sessile species relying on the passive dispersion of larvae and propagules
