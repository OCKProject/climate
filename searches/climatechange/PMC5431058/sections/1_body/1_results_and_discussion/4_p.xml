 </sup>. Our results point to a directional alignment between ocean flow direction and thermal gradients as a possible mechanism that may enhance such conditions, where increasing directional agreement accelerates expansion rates and delays contractions, particularly for organisms relying on the passive dispersal of planktonic eggs and larvae. Such effects could, however, be transient if reduced contraction rates signal a delayed response to warming (i.e., accrual of climatic debts)

 </sup>. An examination of the residuals from the climate-expectation model, used as a proxy for how closely species track changes in thermal conditions (see Methods), suggests that this may be the case for benthic organisms, for which trailing edges contract behind climatic conditions with increased lags (i.e., larger negative residuals) under increasing directional mismatching (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). On the other hand, conditions observed for these taxa under increasing levels of directional mismatching, i.e., higher contraction and lower expansion rates, are linked to a build-up of immigration lags that, if not offset in the future, can further exacerbate climate change risks. These are likely to be enhanced through habitat selectivity, with organisms with specific substrate and habitat requirements, like many benthic taxa, being more limited in their expansion to new favourable environments than generalist groups such as fish and plankton
