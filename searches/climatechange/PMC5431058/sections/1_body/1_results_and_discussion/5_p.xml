<p class="p">Unlike the distribution limits, no clear pattern emerged among taxonomic groups from the effects of directional agreement on shift rates at range centroids or mismatching between observed centroid shifts and climate expectations (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Range centroid shifts capture changes occurring within the entire range of a given species and hence are often more idiosyncratic in their responses to climate change than range edges, where populations are usually at or closer to physiological tolerance limits. Similarly, higher variation in shift response introduced by the interaction of climate change with other interactive non-climatic biotic and abiotic factors is more likely over the broader geographical extent of the entire range
