<p class="p">Our results demonstrate how a contextualization of range shifts to alignment between warming and directional forces (e.g., water or wind flow) can, in combination with other factors such as life-history attributes or particular geographical and habitat settings

 </sup>, help explain differences in expansion and extinction rates while providing mechanistic insight into the transient and net effects of climate change on biodiversity. We show how the use of a simple metric accounting for the mean directional agreement between ocean currents and spatial thermal gradients can significantly improve the amount of variance explained in observed distribution shifts over and above those accounting for isolated effects of changes in climatic patterns. It is however necessary to acknowledge that our meta-analysis does not account for the important role of fine-scale factors on range shift responses to climate change. For example, warming often exhibits heterogeneous patterns in space, season and time, lost from long-term monotonic warming signals, that may be important drivers of observed range shift responses

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>. Similarly, ocean currents are highly dynamic and can change in intensity over time

 </sup> or even reverse direction seasonally
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. While our model captures the mean directional effect, seasonal directionality would be particularly important if species are shifting in (a)synchrony with the appropriate phase of the current seasonal cycle. If existing, such effects will be missed from our mean-effect model resulting in increased residuals and lower predictive power, but cannot be accounted for in our meta-analysis given the lack of information on the timing of the observed biological shifts. Geographical configuration

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup> are also important factors. Lastly, vertical (deepening) as well as horizontal (geographic) distribution shifts are possible
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. All these factors are important and highlight the complexity in anticipating distribution shifts in response to climate change. Our metric can nonetheless be developed in relation to more specific modelling approaches. For example, the persistence and expansion of benthic organisms in asymmetric flow is mainly stochastic and is primarily dependent on the upstream dispersal of planktonic larvae via random fluctuations in currents around the mean current directionality

 </sup>. The capacities to exploit opportunities offered from temporal and spatial variability windows in flow conditions are dependent on different phenological and demographic adaptations regulating traits such as the timing and number of spawning events, the number of propagules released into the water column or dispersal periods
