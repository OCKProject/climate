<p class="p">We found unconditional support for the full model, including support for the effect of climate velocity and for the three-way interaction among directional agreement, biological identity and shift location, which accounts for 66% of the total variance in observed shifts; this is over 25% more than the variance explained by a model based on the climate effects alone (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2a</xref>). The rate of warming expressed as the velocity of climate change nevertheless has a highly statistically significant positive effect on shift rates (

However, the effect of warming on shift responses does not concern only how fast climatic conditions are changing but also to what extent the direction of warming matches that of ocean flows, an effect modulated both by the location of a shift within a species range and by the taxonomic identity of the species involved (20.02 decline in deviance from the full model to a model without the 3-way interaction,
