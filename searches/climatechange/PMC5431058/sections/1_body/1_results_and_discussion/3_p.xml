<p class="p">At the trailing edge of the range, we found indications of an opposite effect of flow directionality on climate-driven range contractions, with benthic organisms (algae and invertebrates) contracting their ranges significantly slower under increasing directional agreement (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). This result contradicts our initial hypothesis, as range contractions were expected to operate independently of directional agreement through the effects of climate on local populations via decreased fitness, increased mortality and ultimate extirpation as climate conditions approach and surpass physiological thresholds

 </sup>. However, the physiological tolerance of local populations within a species range can vary widely due to adaptation and acclimatization to local environmental conditions

 </sup>. External directional forces such as ocean currents and air flows could then contribute to climate-driven extirpation dynamics by shaping how local populations are connected throughout the range of a given species

 </sup>. Contraction rates under directional agreement may therefore be slowed through enhanced adaptive evolution to warming in downstream populations within the distribution range, which is promoted by increasing genetic variations from the arrival of individuals from populations at the trailing edge that are already experiencing climatic conditions that will exist at higher latitudes in the future

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. On the other hand, under directional mismatching, the situation is reversed, with upstream populations swamping trailing edge populations with maladaptive gene flows
