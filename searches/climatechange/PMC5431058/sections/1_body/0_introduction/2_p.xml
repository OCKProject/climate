 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>. For a species tracking a shifting climate, directional forces should facilitate or limit redistribution patterns depending on their directional alignment with spatial gradients of climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The relative importance of this factor should be concomitant with the taxonomic identity of the species involved both in terms of the capacity (from highly motile to sessile) and type (active versus passive dispersers) of response to warming. Further, given the different processes involved
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, the effects of flow directionality on climate-driven shift responses should also be specific to the location of a given shift within a species range. For example, at the leading “cold” edge of the distribution, opportunities for range expansions arise when new habitats become climatically available beyond the current range of the species. Range expansion require the colonization of such habitats as organisms disperse from local range edge populations, a process that should be facilitated under increasing directional agreement (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) between ocean currents and spatial temperature gradients
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. We expect this effect to be stronger for species with active dispersal (fish) and/or prolonged planktonic life stages (holoplankton/fish) than species with shorter larval stages and sessile or sedentary adult forms (benthic invertebrates and algae; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Similarly, active dispersal should confer some capacity to counter the effects of directional mismatching. At the other extreme of the range, contractions of trailing “warm” edges are triggered by temperatures moving beyond the thermal tolerance limit of existing populations. We therefore expect contraction rates to be primarily dependent on the magnitude or rate of warming, as described by the velocity of climate change
 <sup class="sup">
