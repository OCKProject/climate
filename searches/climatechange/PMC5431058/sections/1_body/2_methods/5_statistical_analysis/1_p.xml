<p class="p">Our dataset presented some analytical challenges. First, it consisted of semi-continuous shift data with a point-mass at zero (i.e., zero inflation) and a continuous right-skewed distribution for positive values. Second, a recorded zero shift response can either be a valid observed response, “true zero” with no actual shift response, or a partial observation censored at 0 resulting from a lack of detectability arising, for example, due to a poor sampling resolution. Such combined zero responses cannot be modelled using conventional Tobit models designed for censored data or using two-part zero-inflated models, which assume that all zeros are valid observed responses

 </sup>. Though some alternatives have been proposed as ways to model mixed zero inflated data

 </sup>, these models are not yet sufficiently adapted for the type of analysis required here. Further, given the nature of our meta-dataset, differentiating between censored and true zeros is often not clear from a given context, further hindering the application of such methods. We therefore chose to focus exclusively on reported shift responses (
