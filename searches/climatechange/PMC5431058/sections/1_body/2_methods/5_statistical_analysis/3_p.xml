<p class="p">Residuals from the climate-expectation model, which reflect the isolated effects of climate on range shifts using climate velocity as the sole predictor, were used as a proxy for a species’ capacity to track shifts in thermal conditions. Positive/negative residuals denote species that are shifting ahead of/lagging behind the mean response expected from changes in thermal conditions. Regressions of residuals against mean directional agreement for each reported shift therefore provide a contrast for how flow-thermal directionality influences the capacity of a species to track shifting thermal envelopes independently of the magnitude of that shift. To do this, we conducted a preliminary assessment using alternative velocity estimates to find the climate-expectation model yielding the best fit to the observed shifts. Differences between estimates referred to (i) the temporal extent at which velocities were calculated (either specific to each shift observation or using a fixed period running from 1960–2009 as in

 </sup>); (ii) restricting or not restricting

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> estimates to velocities from cells neighbouring land for coastal species; (iii) using estimates based on annual mean
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup> SSTs or both annual mean and maximum/minimum monthly SSTs to better define shifts at the population centroid and trailing/leading edges, respectively; (iv) using median rather than mean velocities

 </sup>); and (v) considering all velocities over a shift distance

 </sup> or only those corresponding to statistically significant changes in temperature over time to better capture the true magnitude of warming species are facing within the spatial extent dictated by the shift distance. We found unconditional support (1 model weight, 21.8 AICc units above the model ranked second; Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>) for a model based on mean-aggregated velocity estimates comprising only statistically significant velocities (non-significant velocities taken as 0) and limited to cells neighbouring land for coastal species. Models based on median-aggregated estimates did not perform better in most cases than their counterparts based on mean values, perhaps because we truncated the spatial gradients (0.001 °C/km) when computing the local climate velocities to limit the inflating effects of near-zero spatial gradients

 </sup>. Including velocities based on observation-specific time periods or using velocities based on annual mean, minimum or maximum monthly SST depending on the location of a shift within a given range also did not improve the model’s performance. The latter result may reflect a limitation of our mean monthly SST data, which failed to represent extreme climatic conditions.
