<p class="p">We used gamma-distributed generalized linear models (GLM) with a log-link to predict the mean magnitude of shift responses. Predictors included climate velocity estimates as climate expectations, the directional agreement between warming and ocean flows, the location of the shift within the species range, and the biological identity of the species. Our initial full model included climate velocity and three-way interactions between shift locations, biological identity with directional agreement (TableÂ

 </sup> involving all possible predictor combinations from the full global model. The model selection approach was based on the Akaike Information Criterion corrected for finite sample sizes (AICc), and the proportion of total variance explained by the model was defined using the D-squared statistic

 </sup>, which has an analogous interpretation to the coefficient of determination in linear regression models. Unconditional support for a candidate model was given when its corresponding AICc weight was 0.95 or higher. Model diagnostics on the resulting most parsimonious model were assessed both numerically and visually through the inspection of residual patterns (see Supplemental Material). Both climate velocities and observed shifts were fourth-root transformed to improve residual patterns.
