 </sup> for the same period to maintain consistency between thermal and flow data. The directional agreement between ocean flow and spatial thermal gradients was then estimated as the cosine of the angle difference between flow and SST gradients. This index ranges from −1 to 1 for opposite and matching directions, respectively, and takes a value of 0 when vectors are perpendicular (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Single estimates were then calculated for each shift by averaging over all cell values within a circular buffer of radius equal to the reported shift distance.
