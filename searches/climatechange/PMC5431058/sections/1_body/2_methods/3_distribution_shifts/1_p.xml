 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref>), leaving a total of 327 observations, of which 57 (17.4%) were null responses. Further information on the dataset, including data extraction, quality control and processing data, are provided elsewhere

For the purposes of this study, for each observation, we extracted its geographic location and duration (years), the positioning of the shift within the range (range centroid, leading or trailing edge), and the reported rate of shifting (kilometres per decade) as the absolute distance shifted
