 </sup>, temporal trends were calculated as the slope of the linear regression of mean annual SST on time (years), and spatial gradients based on the vector sum of north-south and east-west gradients were applied to each cell using a 3 × 3 neighbourhood window. Single mean velocity estimates for each shift were then obtained from all grid cell values within a circle of radius equal to the reported shift distance
