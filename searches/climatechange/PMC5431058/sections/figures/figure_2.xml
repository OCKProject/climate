  <p class="p">Angles and resulting directional agreement between ocean surface currents and sea surface temperature gradients. Vector angles associated to (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) sea surface temperature gradients and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) annual mean eastward and northward current flow speed components retrieved from ocean satellite-tracked drifter data (1979â€“2012). (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The directional agreement between both parameters estimated as the cosine of the angle difference. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) A non-exhaustive schematic of major surface current systems is provided for comparison. Note how prevailing northward-flowing currents in the Northern Hemisphere and southward-flowing currents in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., Kuroshio and Brazil currents) are dominated by red colours denoting good directional agreement, whereas green colours predominate for southward flowing currents in the Northern Hemisphere and for northern flowing currents in the Southern Hemisphere (e.g., California and Humboldt currents), denoting directional mismatching.
