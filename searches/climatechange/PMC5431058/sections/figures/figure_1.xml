   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Schematic of the hypothesized effect of directional agreement between ocean currents and thermal gradients on range edge dynamics. At the leading “cold” edge of the distribution, new habitats beyond the original range become climatically suited for the species as the species’ thermal envelope expands under warming conditions. Colonization and settlement into these habitats is dependent on the dispersal capacity of the species, which is expected to be enhanced/restricted when ocean currents correspond/do not correspond with the direction of warming. Species with active dispersal capacities (e.g., fish) and lengthy larval dispersal periods (e.g., fish/holoplankton) would be better suited to exploiting favourable flow-warming conditions than those with sessile or sedentary adults and shorter larval dispersal windows (e.g., benthic invertebrates/algae). Similarly, under intensifying levels of directional mismatching, adult active dispersion (e.g., fish) should buffer the negative effects of the current direction on thermal tracking. At the trailing edge of the distribution, warming changes climate conditions within a species’ range beyond its tolerance threshold, resulting in the extirpation of local populations and in the subsequent contraction of the range. This process is expected to occur largely independently of directional agreement. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) We define directional agreement as the cosine of the difference in angle between temperature gradients and ocean currents. The resulting index ranges from −1, where both currents and isotherm movement directions are opposite, to 1, for complete directional agreement.
