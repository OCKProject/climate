  <p class="p">Effect of three-way interactions between directional agreement, taxonomic identity and the location of the shift within the species range (leading, centroid or trailing). (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Mean observed shift rate (+1 standard deviation) weighted by the number of observed years per shift record and grouped by the three parameters. Directional agreement was categorized into four groups reflecting the strength of the agreement between currents and thermal gradients (cos(π/4) = 0.71; see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>): negative [−1, −0.71], slightly negative (−0.71, 0], slightly positive (0, 0.71), and positive [0.71, 1]. Pairwise statistically significant differences between agreement categories within each location-taxa combination are denoted by an asterisk (two sample 
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests, 
   <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05). Levels not represented are those for which no data were available. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Scatterplots of residuals from the climate-expectation model against mean directional agreement by taxonomic group for leading edges, range centroids and trailing edges. Positive/negative residuals suggest observed responses ahead of/lagging behind the mean expected climate response. Lines correspond to the resulting fitted linear regressions weighted by the number of years per observation, with asterisks denoting the statistical significance of slopes (
   <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05).
