<p class="p">A changing climate threatens the quality and continuity of care provided at health care facilities due to more frequent and severe extreme weather events and increased health risks from a range of other climate hazards including food-, water-, vector-borne and zoonotic diseases and poor air quality. Health care facilities will become increasingly vulnerable to impacts from climate change without adaptation [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. For example, extreme weather events can lead to public health emergencies which can overwhelm health care facility capacity, disrupt services, and damage facility infrastructure which can subsequently pose health risks to patients and staff [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In many regions, more extreme heat events and generally warmer summers are expected to increase heat-related illnesses and exacerbate chronic diseases [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Studies have linked extreme heat events with increased health care facility visits [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and similar correlations have been made with poor air quality days [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Health care facilities are highly dependent on critical community services (e.g., electricity, clean drinking water, food service delivery, waste disposal and treatment) that are vulnerable to power disruptions as evidenced by recent events in Canada [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] and internationally [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Health care facility officials may have a false sense of security that critical services will be available in emergencies which may not be the case with changing weather patterns due to climate change [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-11-13097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Risks of critical infrastructure loss from flooding events are expected to rise with climate change and health care facilities will need to adapt systems accordingly. Health professionals will need to be better trained and equipped to diagnose and treat new and emerging diseases and to respond to a wider range of climate-related public health emergencies. Costs and unforeseen expenses associated with climate change impacts may exacerbate existing financial challenges and strain functional capacity of health care systems at the community level [
