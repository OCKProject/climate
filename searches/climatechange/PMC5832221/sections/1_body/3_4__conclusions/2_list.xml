  <p class="p">Runoff in the karst watershed during the research period exhibits a three-stage change. The abrupt change points are the years 1981 and 2007. The first stage is 1968–1980. During this period, the runoff initially exhibited a trend of sustained decreasing and then an abrupt fluctuation. Improper land utilisation and serious forest and grass destruction intensified the fluctuation variation amplitude of the runoff. The second stage is 1981–2006. During this period, the variation curves of runoff and precipitation exhibited good synchronism. Precipitation significantly affected runoff variation and human activities had a small interference degree. The third stage is 2007–2013. During this period, the fluctuation range of runoff was considerably smaller than that of precipitation. The significant growth of forest and grassland areas and the increase in water consumption mitigated runoff fluctuation and greatly diminished runoff variation amplitude.</p>

  <p class="p">The influences of precipitation and human activities on runoff are separated by applying double mass curve. The contribution rates of human activities and precipitation to runoff variation from 1968 to 1980 were −81% and 181%, respectively. The average contribution rates of human activities and precipitation to runoff variation from 2007 to 2013 were −117% and 217%, respectively.</p>
