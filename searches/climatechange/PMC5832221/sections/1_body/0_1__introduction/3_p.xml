<p class="p">The karst watershed of southwestern China is located in the upper reaches of Yangtze River and Pearl River in China. And it has both the ecological and environmental significance for the survival and development of about 100 million people. However, the rock is fragile, the soil is shallow, the rain is likely to leach into the ground, the rocky desertification is serious and the ecological environment is fragile in the karst area because of the unique geological background and features of the environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Water problems have been a key factor restricting the development of social and economic environment in karst regions of southwest China. So the research on the water cycle in karst watershed is significant for the environmental protection and sustainable development of the area.
