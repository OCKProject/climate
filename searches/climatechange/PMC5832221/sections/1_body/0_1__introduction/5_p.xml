<p class="p">Based on data from Liudong river basin, statistical methods are applied to analyse the runoff of the watershed. The purposes of this study are: (1) to reveal the time series evolution characteristics of runoff and precipitation in the research region in the recent 50 years; (2) to analyse comprehensively the driving factor of runoff variation; and (3) to estimate quantitatively the contribution rate of precipitation and human activities to runoff variation. The present work will provide a better understanding of the interactions between human and nature. Meanwhile, provide important insights into water resources management in the karst area.</p>
