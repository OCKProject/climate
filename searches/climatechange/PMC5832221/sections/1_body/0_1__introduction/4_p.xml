<p class="p">In karst area, many scholars have analyzed the evolution characteristics of precipitation and runoff series. Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] analyzed the annual and seasonal variation of runoff process in Guizhou karst watershed based on L-moments method and MK method. Chen et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] used BP ANN to establish runoff prediction model of surface karst spring in Luota River area, Hunan Province. And on this basis, some scholars have qualitatively discussed the driving factors of the runoff process. For example, some of them [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] discussed the rainfall–runoff characteristics on the slope of different land use types in a typical karst region based on the observation of runoff plots and obtained varying results due to different geological backgrounds and vegetation types. Kong et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] have qualitatively discussed the influence of human activities on runoff in karst watershed based on the analysis of the variation characteristics of runoff series in the past 50 years, and indicated that human activities generally increased the runoff. Furthermore, some scholars tried to apply hydrological models those are appropriate in non-karst regions to karst regions, and quantitatively discussed the water cycle in karst regions. For instance, in order to assess the sustainability of the actual water use in the Island of Crete, Anna Malagò et al. (2016) developed a methodology combining the SWAT model and a karst-flow model [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. However, an in-depth discussion of the influence of natural factors and human activities on runoff variation in a typical karst drainage basin is currently lacking. Moreover, how to evaluate the influence of climate change and human activities is still an open question which needs further research to provide a comprehensive and reasonable explanation to the observed runoff variation.
