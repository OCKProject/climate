<p class="p">In recent years, the runoff formation in a changing environment has become an important scientific problem in hydrology [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. A better understanding of the runoff changes and their potential driving forces are thus of paramount importance to effectively utilize water resources and reasonably manage river flows. Generally, climate change and human activities are significant factors influencing runoff variation [
