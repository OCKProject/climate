 <xref rid="pone.0193073.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows the statistical table of contribution rates of human activity interference and climate change to runoff variation in the research region from 1968 to 1980 and from 2007 to 2013. In the variation section from 1968 to 1980, the increasing and decreasing influences of human activity interference on the runoff in the research region appeared alternatively. The average value was −81%, whereas the average value of contribution rate of climate change was 181%. In the variation section from 2007 to 2013, the average value of influence of the significant increase of forest and grass area and the great increase of water consumption on runoff variation was −117%, and the contribution rate of climate change was 217%.
