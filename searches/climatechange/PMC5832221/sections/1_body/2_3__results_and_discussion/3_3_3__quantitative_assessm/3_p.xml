<p class="p">The influence of human activities and climate change on runoff is calculated according to Formulas (

 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0193073.e013" class="xref">11</xref>). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g016" class="xref">Fig 16</xref> shows the result. Except the precipitation during 1968 and 1974, precipitation generally exerted a mobilisation effect on runoff variation. In 1968, the mobilisation effect of human activities balanced the decreasing effect of precipitation and greatly increased runoff. From 1969 to 1976, the influences of human activities on runoff in the drainage basin played a negative role and reduced the flow. From 1977 to 1980, the influence of human activities on runoff variation alternatively played positive and negative roles, thereby greatly intensifying the fluctuation amplitude of runoff. Except those in 2013, the effects of human activities and precipitation from 2007 to 2013 were opposite and balanced mutually, thereby greatly decreasing the fluctuation amplitude of runoff. This result is consistent with the preceding analysis, which shows that the influence of human activities on runoff is inconsistent in different years.
