<p class="p">The trend analysis can only give a qualitative description of the impact of climatic factors and human activities on runoff changes. Their contributions will be calculated quantitatively by double-cumulative curve method below. According to the above analysis, there is no obvious correlation existed between the annual runoff and the annual average temperature in the typical karst region in southwest China in the recent 50 years and that the evaporation capacity exerted minimal influence on runoff variation. Meanwhile, the influence of temperature on runoff is considerably smaller than that of precipitation and other human activities because the short-term temperature fluctuation is usually small. Hereby, climate factors which influence runoff variation in the research region are simplified as precipitation, and non-natural factors are summed up as human activities. Human activities influence various fields, including changing underlying surface, implementation of soil and water conservation measures, water consumption variation and so on. The causes of land use variation are difficult to analyse because the annual variation values of subitem land use in this drainage basin are difficult to collect, and some statistics data are not true. Thus, only the contribution rate of comprehensive influence of human activities on runoff variation is discussed in this article.</p>
