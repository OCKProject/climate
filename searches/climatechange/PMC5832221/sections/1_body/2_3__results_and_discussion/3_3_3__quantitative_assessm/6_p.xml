<p class="p">In this study, we investigate the contribution rate of human activities and climate change to runoff variation but not for the overall fluctuation of runoff. The double mass curve is applied in this study to calculate the contribution rates of human activities and climate change to runoff variation. However, this method finally overestimates the contribution rate of human activities and underestimates the contribution rate of climate change when separating the hydrological effect of these two elements mainly because the hydrological effect of precipitation and nonprecipitation element is separated by this method. Precipitation is the decisive factor affecting runoff variation. However, the temperature rise increases evaporation and decreases runoff. Although the results of the previous analysis indicated that the temperature in the study area has no significant effect on runoff, the possible effect of temperature increase is hard to take into consideration in this study. Therefore, the estimated influence of human activities on the runoff in this research is the maximum possible contribution rate. Nevertheless, the temperature change amplitude in the short term is usually small, and its influence on runoff is considerably smaller than that of precipitation and other human activities. Therefore, the evaluation result obtained in this study is basically accurate and has an important reference value.</p>
