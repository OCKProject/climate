<p class="p">Since 2007, the runoff fluctuation amplitude has become considerably smaller than the precipitation variation because of the obvious restoration of ecology and abrupt increase in human water consumption. On the one hand, Ecological restoration projects strengthened the water conservation capacity of the watershed. Li et al. (2009) [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] reported that the difference in annual runoff amongst different vegetation types in a typical karst region is obvious. Runoff in agriculture land was two to three times of that in shrub forest. However, forest land converted from cultivated land showed good soil and water conservation effectiveness. Grassland demonstrated a strong detention effect on rainfall at a small rainfall intensity. The research on karst region conducted by Li et al. (2012) [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] also showed that forest and grassland, that elicit a good detention effect on water, increase the infiltration of runoff in soil and surface leakage, which greatly decreases runoff. Therefore, the effective control of soil and water loss and ecological restoration in this stage increased the function of water storage and retention of vegetation and soil in the study area, resulting in an increase in runoff at low water level and a decrease in runoff at high water level [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. So the fluctuation of runoff was mitigated significantly. On the other hand, economic development and population growth have increased sharply the demand for water resources, which directly decreased river runoff amount. Total water consumption in Guizhou Province from 1999 to 2013 showed a gradual increasing trend from 3.833 billion m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> in 1999 to 4.507 billion m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> in 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The increase in industrial water consumption was the lead cause of the increase in total water consumption. Since the 2010s, the utilisation rate of water resources in Zhujiang drainage basin in Guizhou Province has exceeded 10%, which was obviously higher than that at the beginning of the 21st century.
