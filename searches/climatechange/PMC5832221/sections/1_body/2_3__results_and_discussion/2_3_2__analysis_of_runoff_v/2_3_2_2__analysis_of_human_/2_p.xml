<p class="p">From 1968 to 1980, the improper land use patterns and vegetation destruction increased the total runoff and intensification of fluctuation amplitude. Relevant studies have shown that the surface runoff in karst regions is difficult to produce. However, if surface vegetation is greatly interfered and damaged by human activities, then the rain water intercepting, collecting and holding capacity of vegetation are continuously impaired. The coefficient of surface runoff increases in a mutation type when the precipitation reaches a certain level [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] showed that, once the forest is regressed to grassâ€“shrub slope and other vegetation after suffering damages, a fold increase of surface runoff occurs, thereby deteriorating the surrounding ecological environment. Therefore, the decrease of forest coverage and the increase of bedrock exposure led to serious soil and water loss in the study area, and the speed and intensity of water eco-environmental degradation intensified rapidly.
