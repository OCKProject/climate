 <xref rid="pone.0193073.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. From 1990 to 2000, the overall performance of forestry was the mutual transition between grass land and cultivated land, and no significant change in total area existed. Moreover, 45% of the area transited from grass land formed cultivated land, and the area increment of paddy field mainly came from the transition of grass land and arid land. The expansion of building lot was mainly composed of cultivated land transition, which accounted for 89.5%. From 2000 to 2010, the area increment of forestry and grass land mainly came from cultivated land transition, in which the arid land transition was significant. A part of paddy field was transited to arid land. The expansion of building lot was mainly composed of cultivated land transition. In summary, the land use change in the drainage basin was featured with mutual transition between grass land and cultivated land and continuous expansion of building lot since 1990. From 1990 to 2000, the grass land and cultivated land transited mutually. However, no significant change in the total proportion occurred. From 2000 to 2007, the cultivated land transited to grass land in great proportion, and a part of paddy field transited to arid land.
