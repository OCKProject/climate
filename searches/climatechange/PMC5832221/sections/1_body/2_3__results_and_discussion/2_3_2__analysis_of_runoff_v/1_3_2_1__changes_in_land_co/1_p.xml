<p class="p">LUCC directly reflects the intensity of the impact of human activities. The influence of LUCC on hydrological processes will directly lead to changes in water supply and demand relations. Thus, exploring the effects of LUCC on karst hydrology and water resources is the key point to alleviate the contradiction between human activities and the natural environment in karst Area. The land cover structure and the change process are analyzed below. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref> shows the land use vector diagram in 1990, 2000 and 2010. Change features of land use since 1990 are shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The main land use types are forestry, grass land and cultivated land, accounting for 99% of the total area. Forest land had the largest proportion among them, taking more than 50% of the total area, followed by dry land, grassland and paddy fields. Due to locational and historical reasons, social development level of karst area in southwest China is low. And the rural population is heavy and the economic development depends heavily on the land resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Liudong River Basin is no exception, and the proportion of cultivated land accounted for more than 30% during 1990 ~2000.
