<p class="p">Before the 1980s, forestry and grass land area in the research region were significantly damaged under the influence of historical events in the previous period[
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>], such as the Great Leap Forward, Mass Movement to Produce Iron and the influence of agriculture and economic reform, which made the proportion of cultivated land accounted for more than 30% during 1990 ~2000. Since the 1980s, China has implemented several large-scale ecological construction projects in Guizhou Province. By the end of 2004, the comprehensive control area of soil and water conservation achieved 22230.15 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in the entire province, which accounted for 12.6% of the total area in the entire province [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. From 1987 to 2000, the soil and water loss area in the province decreased by approximately 5%. According to the strength variation of soil and water loss, the slight and medium loss areas increased by 9.22% and 8.43%, respectively, and the high degree and extremely high degree of soil and water loss areas decreased by 46.37% and 57.64%, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Measures of conversion of cropland to forest and closed forest in the study area led to an increase of green and decrease of cultivated land. And the regional ecological environment has improved gradually. Since the 2000s, some construction projects, such as key project control of soil and water conservation and small drainage basin control, were strengthened in the whole province. And since 2006, the comprehensive control of rock desertification has been fully implemented in the research region [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. The forest and grassland areas in the research region increased greatly in 2010 compared with 2000. The cultivated land, particularly for grass land, decreased greatly, and the ecological environment was in a good restoration condition.
