<p class="p">For the recent 50a, the interannual variation of runoff and precipitation in the drainage basin is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g006" class="xref">Fig 6(a)</xref>. Except for the interannual normal fluctuation, the annual runoff shows a decreasing trend with a variation rate of −1.34 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s·a, which does not reach 90% significant level. High and low flow values appeared in 1979 and 1989. The difference between high and low flow is 37.97 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s, and the annual extreme value ratio is 3.8. The precipitation shows a decreasing trend. The climate tendency rate is −5.04 mm/a, and the decreasing trend is significant at the α = 0.05 significant level. The annual variation curve of the average runoff and precipitation for several years in Liudong river drainage basin given in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g006" class="xref">Fig 6(b)</xref> shows that the runoff changes with the precipitation and that the annual runoff process line basically corresponds with the precipitation process line, which shows a single peak type. The runoff in January is the minimum value of the whole year, and the annual average value is only 6.15 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. The runoff reaches the maximum value in June, and its annual average value is 77.51 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. The distribution of runoff during the year is not even, and it concentrates in flood period and counts 69% of the annual average runoff.
