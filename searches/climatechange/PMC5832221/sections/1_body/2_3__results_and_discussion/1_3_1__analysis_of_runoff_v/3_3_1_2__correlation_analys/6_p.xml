<p class="p">The contrastive analysis of the time-frequency distribution diagram of runoff and precipitation shows that the variation trends of runoff and precipitation in the research region are generally similar in the time and frequency domains. In addition, variation periods are synchronised to some extent, which is consistent with the aforementioned results. The results reaffirmed that the variation of precipitation is the main cause of runoff variation to some extent. However, an obvious difference also exists amongst their periodic variations. The precipitation series has 9a obvious period, whereas runoff has 14a obvious period, which is slightly larger than the variation period of precipitation. Moreover, runoff has no obvious period variation in 23a scale. In 3a scale, the precipitation series is stable throughout the analysis period. However, the runoff series is only active from the end of 1970 to 1990. This observation indicates that the periodic variation of the remaining time periods is largely influenced by nonclimate factors. Therefore, the runoff is influenced by climate change and largely influenced by human activities. Under different time scales, different variation combinations of climate change and human activities exert different influences on runoff. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g010" class="xref">Fig 10</xref> shows the multiyear variation curve after standardization treatment of annual runoff and annual precipitation in Liudong river basin. The figure shows that the annual runoff and annual precipitation from 1981 to 2006 exhibit a good synchronous change relationship in the fluctuation, but those before 1981 and after 2006 show a clear separation. From 1968 to 1973, the precipitation shows fluctuation and changes, whereas the runoff shows a continuous decreasing trend. From 1978 to 1980, the runoff shows abrupt fluctuation which is far off the precipitation variation curve. From 2007 to 2013, the fluctuation amplitude of the runoff in the research region is considerably smaller than that of precipitation. Relevant studies [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] have shown that precipitation variation may be magnified in runoff. However, the runoff fluctuation amplitude from 1968 to 1973 and from 2007 to 2013 in the research region is considerably smaller than precipitation, meanwhile the runoff fluctuation variation from 1968 to 1979 and from 2007 to 2013 is not completely synchronised with precipitation variation. This finding indicates that the precipitationâ€“runoff relationship during these two periods is interfered by non-precipitation factors, such as land cover change and industrial and agricultural water use. This finding also proves the preceding research results.
