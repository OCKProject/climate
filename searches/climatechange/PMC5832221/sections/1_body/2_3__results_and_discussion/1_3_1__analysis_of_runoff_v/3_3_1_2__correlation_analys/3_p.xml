<p class="p">The wavelet variance diagram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>) is plotted to verify further the precipitation and runoff periods. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g008" class="xref">Fig 8(a)</xref> shows that precipitation has three peak values, namely, 3a, 9a and 23a. The first main period is 3a, and it has the strongest periodic oscillation. Then, the main periods 9a and 23a follow. Whereas, two obvious peak values exist in the wavelet variance diagram of runoff (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g008" class="xref">Fig 8(b)</xref>), and these peak values correspond to time scales 3a and 14a. The first peak value corresponds to time scale 14a, and the periodic oscillation of this time scale is the strongest. This period is the first main period of the drainage basin, and 3a is the second period.
