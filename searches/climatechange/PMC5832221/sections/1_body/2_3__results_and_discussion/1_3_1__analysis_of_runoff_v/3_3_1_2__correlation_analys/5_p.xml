<p class="p">Current studies suggested that the periodic variation of meteorological and hydrological series was concerned with the motion of celestial bodies and solar activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. The period of runoff for 14a and precipitation for 9a and 23a coincide with the Sunspot period of about 11a and the Haier cycle of about 22a. The period of runoff and precipitation for 3a is related to the quasi-periodic for 5â€“7 year period of ENSO event [
