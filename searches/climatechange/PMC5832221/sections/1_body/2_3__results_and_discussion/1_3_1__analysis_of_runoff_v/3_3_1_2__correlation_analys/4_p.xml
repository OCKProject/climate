 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>) is plotted. For precipitation, two oscillations analysed from 23a scale. These oscillations are shown in detail: high flows in 1968–1979 and 1992–2003; low flows in 1980–1991 and 2004–2013. The periodic variation of 9a scale is mainly active in the 1990s and at the beginning of the 20th century. Whereas, the periodic variation of 3a scale is stable throughout the analysis period of precipitation and applicable to the overall situation. As analysed from 14a scale, the runoff variation experiences three high and low flows for the runoff. The periods 1968–1969, 1977–1983, 1991–1997 and 2006–2012 are positive phases, that is the abundant stage. Other time periods are dry. The periodic variation of 14a scale is stable throughout the analysis period and applicable to the overall situation. Its periodic variation energy is the largest, and it has the largest contribution to the variance of the original runoff series. The runoff fluctuation of 3a time scale is large and this time scale has many abrupt change points. The periodic variation is mainly active during 1970–1990. In general, the runoff in 14a scale will enter a dry period for a certain period in the future. On the contrary, the runoff in 3a scale will enter an abundant period. The reason is that the abrupt change points in a small time scale gradually regress to normal points with the increase in time scale, however, singular points increase with the decrease in time scale. Some normal states in a large time scale are catastrophe states in a low level. Therefore, the target region is in dry period from a large time scale.
