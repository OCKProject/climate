<p class="p">According to the preceding analysis, time periods 1968–1980, 1981–2006 and 2007–2013 are represented by I, II and III, respectively. A list is provided to compare the average value, standard deviation and

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) of precipitation and runoff during time periods I, II and III. During time period I, both the standard deviation and coefficient of variation for annual average precipitation are smaller than those during time period II. However, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation for runoff remain the same as those during time period II. The ratio of coefficient of variation for runoff to that of precipitation during the time period I is 2, which is smaller than 1.67 during time period II. Therefore, compared with that during the time period II, the human activity interference during time period I intensifies the fluctuation variation amplitude of the runoff. During time period III, the standard deviation of precipitation increases by 71.2mm, and the coefficient of variation increases by 0.07 compared with those during time period II. However, the standard deviation of the runoff decreases by 29.7mm, and the coefficient of variation decreases by 0.09 compared with those during time period II. The ratio of coefficient of variation for runoff to that of precipitation during time period III is 0.73, which is considerably smaller than that during time period II. Therefore, unlike those during time period II, the human activities during time period III significantly influence runoff variation and mitigate runoff fluctuation amplitude.
