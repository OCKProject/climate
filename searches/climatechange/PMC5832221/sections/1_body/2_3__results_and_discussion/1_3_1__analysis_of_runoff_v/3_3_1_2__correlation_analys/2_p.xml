<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>, the trend of runoff is largely consistent with the precipitation variation in the study area. But the decrease of annual precipitation is larger than that of the annual runoff. The correlation coefficient between annual runoff and precipitation is 0.799, and the significance level is less than 0.001, indicating that there is a high correlation between them. These mean that the evolution of runoff in the study area is mainly affected by precipitation. This is consistent with previous studies on karst areas in Southwest China [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g007" class="xref">Fig 7(a) and 7(b)</xref>, which illustrate time-frequency representation of the real part of wavelet coefficient for precipitation and runoff, show the high and low flow phase structures under different time scales. Diagrams indicate that the variations of runoff and precipitation for the recent 50a in the research region are superimposed by periodic oscillations of different lengths. The high and low flow cycles of precipitation and runoff corresponding to different time scales are different. And the high and low flow cycles of the small scale are included in the complicated high and low flow structures of a large time scale. In the interdecadal scale, the 8-12a scale signal is the most obvious for precipitation variation. In addition, precipitation has a minor cycle of 20-25a scale, but the isoline is loose. The closing state of isoline is not good, and the signal is weak. However, for the interdecadal period of runoff, the 10-20a scale signal is the most obvious. Its central time scale is approximately 14a. For annual variation, the periodic variations of precipitation and runoff have the strongest signal in 2-4a scale. The positive and negative phases appear alternatively and are distributed intensively. The closing state of isoline is good and has high and low frequency oscillations of wavelet coefficient.
