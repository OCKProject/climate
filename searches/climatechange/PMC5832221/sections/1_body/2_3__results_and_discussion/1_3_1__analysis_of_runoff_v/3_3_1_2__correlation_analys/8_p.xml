<p class="p">According to the preceding analysis, the runoff in the drainage basin in the research region shows a three-phase variation. The years 1981 and 2007 are taken as the dividing points, and the period 1981–2006 is regarded as reference section with the periods 1968–1980 and 2007–2013 are regarded as variation section, respectively. In the reference section, the fluctuation of the runoff in the drainage basin is mainly caused by climate change, and precipitation exerts a decisive influence on runoff variation. However, in the variation section, the variation of the runoff in the research region is caused by both climate change and human activities.</p>
