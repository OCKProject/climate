<p class="p">The annual temperature change curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) shows that the average temperature does not show significant growth trend in the past 50 years. The linear change rate is 0.1째C/10a, which does not reach 90% significant level. The highest mean annual temperature was 17.93째C (2013) and the lowest was 15.93째C (1984). The average temperature was 16.99째C during the study period. The temperature variation remained relatively stable and the relative change range was only 1.13. It can be seen from the 5-year average sliding curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) and the anomaly map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) that the temperature in the basin was stable during the 1970s and had no obvious change, and then shown a visible downward tendency. The annual average temperature was continuously lower than the average level until the middle 1990s. Subsequently, the temperature began to increase significantly. The negative anomaly was dominated before 1997, and then the positive anomaly followed. It is consistent with the background that there was a cold period before the 1990 s and a warm period later in China.
