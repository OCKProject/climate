<p class="p">The relationship between annual mean temperature and annual runoff is analyzed by plotting the scattergram (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193073.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). It can be seen that there is no obvious statistical relationship between temperature and runoff over the past 50 years. In order to further analyze the relationship between temperature and runoff in the study area, SPSS was utilized to analyze the correlation between them. The result shows that the correlation coefficient between annual runoff and annual mean temperature was -0.18, but the correlation does not prove a statistical significance (P-Value was 0.23). Therefore, there was no correlation between temperature and runoff in the study area. This is consistent with previously studies in other typical karst areas of southwestern China [

 <xref rid="pone.0193073.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Furthermore, it implied that evaporation has little effect on runoff variation. Meanwhile, the effect of temperature on runoff is much smaller than that of precipitation and other human activities due to the small temperature change in the short term.
