The topography is characterised by higher in the north and lower in the south. The average elevation is 1020 m. Emergence stratums are Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic strata. Carbonate rocks are widely distributed, which is a typical karst terrain featured with karst depression, funnel, sinkhole and underground river development. The climate in the drainage basin is subtropical humid monsoon climate. The annual mean temperature is 17°C, and average annual rainfall is 1220mm. The land use types are mainly forest land, cultivated land and shrub. The vegetation is mainly composed of masson pine, firewood forest and clastic rock bush wood, and the forest coverage rate is approximately 50%.
