<p class="p">It is worth noting that we focus on the contribution of human activities and climate change to the net runoff component in this study. The combined effect of the two factors is assumed as the unit. On the one hand, if both elements cause the runoff to change in the same direction, that is, decrease or increase at the same time,

 </sub> is less than one. On the other hand, when the impact of climate change on the runoff is opposite to that of human activities, the absolute value of the contribution rate of the two factors maybe larger than 1. For example, when the value of net runoff is positive, but climate change has a negative impact on runoff, then the contribution rate of human activities to runoff variation will be greater than +1.
