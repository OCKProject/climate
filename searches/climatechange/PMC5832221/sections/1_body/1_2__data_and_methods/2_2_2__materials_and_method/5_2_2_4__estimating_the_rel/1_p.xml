<p class="p">Multiple regression is usually used to determine the contribution rate of natural factors and human activities to runoff variation. However, the research results obtained about the same research object by different researchers have large differences because the weight assignment of each influencing factor is determined by human. The multiple correlation coefficient between each factor of multiple regression is small; thus, the obtained result accuracy is also small. This finding shows that this method is considerably limited [

Thus, the double mass curve method is adopted in this article to analyse quantitatively the influence of climate change and human activities on runoff. The contribution rate of human activities and climate change to runoff is derived by establishing the rainfallâ€“runoff model when the influence of human activities is small and by restoring the runoff when the influence of human activities is large. Both independent and dependent variables are cumulants, thereby eliminating the influence of the annual fluctuation of measured data to some extent and creating conditions for further quantitative analysis. The specific method is as follows [
