<p class="p">Climate change affects runoff generation process in the setting of changing human activity. This can be studied by comparison of runoff generation between “base-line” and “measure” periods. The dividing point between these two periods can be determined by time series analysis, to detect the abrupt change in the temporal variation in runoff.</p>
