<p class="p">Morlet wavelet has a similar waveform to runoff time series and good localisation in the time frequency domain. Therefore, Morlet complex wavelet is selected in this article to conduct continuous wavelet transform to annual runoff series in the research region and to extract the wavelet coefficient and the wavelet variance of the series. Wavelet variance reflects the distribution of fluctuation energy with scale and can be used to determine the main time scale in a time series for the peak of variance corresponds to different primary periods of series from large to small. The horizontal section of wavelet coefficient indicates the change of wavelet of each period in the time series with time. The wavelet coefficient has a positive relationship with runoff, and the alternates of maximum and minimum values of wavelet coefficient under a certain time scale correspond to high and low flow cycles in this scale; thus, the multi-time scale periodicity and discontinuity of time series can be identified by analysing wavelet coefficient.</p>
