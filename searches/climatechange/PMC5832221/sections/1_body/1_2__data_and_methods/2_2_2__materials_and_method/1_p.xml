<p class="p">Runoff data adopted in this article is the monthly runoff data from 1968 to 2013 of the controlling surface water hydrological station—Pinghu Hydrological Station—in the midstream and upstream of Liudong River drainage basin. These runoff data are obtained from the Hydrology and Water Resources Bureau of Guizhou Province. The daily precipitation data and the daily mean temperature data from 1968 to 2013 of Pingtan Station provided by the Website of China Meteorological Data Service Center (CMDC) (

The three sets of TM images (1990, 2000 and 2010) are obtained, and their resolutions are 30 m. The quality of images meets the application requirements with a low cloud cover (2.32%, 0.19% and 0% respectively). In consideration of the geographic characteristics, image quality and the research objective of this article, the following classification system is adopted: forestry, grass land, water area, arid land, paddy field and building lot. All the image data in this research are adopted standard false colour composite images, and they are combined with Google Earth high-resolution images. The visual interpretation is provided in human–machine interface mode, and the images are treated after classification. Overall accuracy values are 96.89%, 98.55% and 93.17% respectively, and kappa coefficient values are 0.95, 0.97 and 0.93respectively. The interpretation results were validated and modified through field investigation, which derives the three-phase land use vector diagram in 1990, 2000 and 2010. The data processing software programs are MATLAB 7.0, SPSS 22.0, ENVI 5.2 and ArcGIS 10.2. The technology roadmap of this research is shown in the
