 <p id="Par1" class="p">Biological nitrogen fixation can fuel CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration by forests but can also stimulate soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O), a potent greenhouse gas. Here we use a theoretical model to suggest that symbiotic nitrogen-fixing trees could either mitigate (CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration outweighs soil N
  <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions) or exacerbate (vice versa) climate change relative to non-fixing trees, depending on their nitrogen fixation strategy (the degree to which they regulate nitrogen fixation to balance nitrogen supply and demand) and on nitrogen deposition. The model posits that nitrogen-fixing trees could exacerbate climate change globally relative to non-fixing trees by the radiative equivalent of 0.77 Pg C yr
  <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under nitrogen deposition rates projected for 2030. This value is highly uncertain, but its magnitude suggests that this subject requires further study and that improving the representation of biological nitrogen fixation in climate models could substantially decrease estimates of the extent to which forests will mitigate climate change.
