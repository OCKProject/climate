<p id="Par9" class="p">Obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixers sustain N fixation after satisfying their N demand, whereas facultative N-fixers shut off N fixation after satisfying their N demand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Over succession, obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixers promote greater N supply to the ecosystem via sustained N fixation than facultative N-fixers (indicated by the vertical lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b, c</xref>). Under low N deposition, N supplied via N fixation by obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixing trees facilitates non-fixing trees in meeting their N demand, amplifying ecosystem-scale CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration to a greater extent than that by facultative N-fixing trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). However, this N supplied via N fixation also stimulates soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). This is especially pronounced for obligate N-fixers, which sustain N fixation at a higher rate than incomplete regulator N-fixers. As such, under low N deposition rates, incomplete regulator N-fixing trees exhibit the greatest net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O cooling effect because of their high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). They are followed by obligate N-fixing trees, which have a similarly high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect but a higher N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Facultative N-fixing trees, which have a substantially lower CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect, have the lowest net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O cooling effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>).
