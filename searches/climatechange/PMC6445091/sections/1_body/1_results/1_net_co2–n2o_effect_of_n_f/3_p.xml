<p id="Par10" class="p">Increased N supply to the ecosystem via elevated N deposition induces N-fixing trees to downregulate N fixation to the greatest extent possible (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>): facultative N-fixers completely downregulate N fixation and incomplete regulator N-fixers partially downregulate N fixation, whereas obligate N-fixers do not downregulate N fixation. Because facultative N-fixing trees completely downregulate N fixation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), they have a negligible net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect relative to non-fixing trees under high N deposition rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>). Under high N deposition rates, N demand is satisfied by N deposition. As such, N fixed by obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixing trees due to sustained N fixation does not contribute to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Rather, it contributes to soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions, which increase indefinitely with increasing N fixation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). Thus, obligate and incomplete regulator N-fixing trees exhibit a considerable N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect, yielding a net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O warming effect relative to non-fixing trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>).
