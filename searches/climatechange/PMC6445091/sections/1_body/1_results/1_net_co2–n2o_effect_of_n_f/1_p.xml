<p id="Par8" class="p">Our model suggests that N-fixing trees can either mitigate climate change relative to non-fixing trees (a negative net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees) or exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees (a positive net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees relative to non-fixing trees). The main controls that determine this balance are N fixation strategy and N deposition rate (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> display results for temperate and boreal forests respectively; because patterns are analogous between tropical, temperate, and boreal forests we hereafter focus on tropical forests). For N-fixing trees that exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions do not necessarily offset the absolute level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration (see Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for the absolute net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effects of ecosystems with and without N-fixing trees). Rather, the offset of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration by soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems with N-fixing trees is greater than the offset of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration by soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems without N-fixing trees. Similarly, for N-fixing trees that mitigate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, the offset of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration by soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems with N-fixing trees is lower than the offset of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration by soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions for ecosystems without N-fixing trees. Generally, under low N deposition rates, N-fixing trees promote CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration but only minimal soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions relative to non-fixing trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), whereas under high N deposition rates, N-fixing trees stimulate soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions but only minimal CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration relative to non-fixing trees (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>).
