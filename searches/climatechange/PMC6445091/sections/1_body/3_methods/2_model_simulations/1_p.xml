<p id="Par26" class="p">Simulations of the model were conducted in R using the package deSolve. We parameterized our model for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>), and conducted the following simulations for each parameterization. We simulated four versions of the model (ecosystems containing only non-fixers, ecosystems containing non-fixers and obligate N-fixers, ecosystems containing non-fixers and facultative N-fixers, and ecosystems containing non-fixers and incomplete regulator N-fixers) for 100 years. We simulated each of the four versions of the model under three N deposition rates: past (low; pre-Anthropocene; from Galloway et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>), recent (intermediate; 2001 and 2006; from Vet et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup> and Dentener et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup> respectively), and future N deposition rates (high; 2030 for the SRES A2 scenario
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>; from Dentener et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). N deposition rates for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests were estimated using weighted averages with tropical, temperate, and boreal forest areas (from the 2015 Global Forest Resources Assessment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>
 </sup>). The range of N deposition rates can also be representative of varying degrees of N enrichment from other sources (rock weathering N input, turnover, mineralization, etc.). Additionally, we simulated each of the four versions of the model under low, intermediate, and high initial soil N pool sizes (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>).
