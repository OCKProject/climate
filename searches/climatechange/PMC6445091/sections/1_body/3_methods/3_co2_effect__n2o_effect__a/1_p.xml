<p id="Par27" class="p">We calculated the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effects of the ecosystem with two complementary methods. The first method quantifies total change in the sizes of the biomass C pools and the atmospheric N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O pool, converting N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> radiative equivalents using global warming potentials. The second method quantifies net radiative forcing from continuous changes in the sizes of the biomass C pools and the atmospheric N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O pool. Both methods calculate the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effects of the ecosystem over 100 years, similar to the IPCCâ€™s SRES and Representative Concentration Pathways. The first method is easier to compare to studies of standing biomass C pools, whereas the second method gives a more accurate accounting of net radiative forcing. Results given in the main text are from the first method, but both methods give similar results.
