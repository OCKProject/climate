<p id="Par6" class="p">Here we use a theoretical modeling approach to ask two main questions: how do N-fixing trees influence the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of forests, i.e. do N-fixing trees mitigate or exacerbate climate change? How will their influence change under elevated N deposition rates? We use the terms mitigate and exacerbate to highlight that the influence of N-fixing trees is relative to ongoing greenhouse gas effects. In forests, the cooling effect of CO
