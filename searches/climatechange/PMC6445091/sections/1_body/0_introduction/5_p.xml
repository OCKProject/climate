<p id="Par7" class="p">We use a differential equation ecosystem model that captures the fluxes and pools of carbon (C) and N in an ecosystem, and includes competition between N-fixing and non-fixing trees. We validated the model against literature estimates of the relevant fluxes and pools of C and N in tropical, temperate, and boreal forests. The model predicts CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect) and soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect) of an ecosystem with a given dominant N fixation strategy. We compute the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of the ecosystem with two complementary methods. The first method compares accumulated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration to accumulated soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions after 100 years of ecosystem succession using the global warming potential of N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O. The second method computes the net radiative forcing from continuous CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration and soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions over 100 years of ecosystem succession. To evaluate the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effects of N-fixing trees, we compare model ecosystems of non-fixing trees to model ecosystems that contain both N-fixing trees and non-fixing trees. Model ecosystems with N-fixing trees contain one of three empirically supported N fixation strategies

 </sup>: obligate (fix N at a constant rate per unit biomass), perfectly facultative (downregulate N fixation to perfectly meet their N demand after taking up soil N; hereafter facultative), and incomplete regulator (downregulate N fixation similarly to the facultative strategy but sustain N fixation at a constant minimum rate). The difference in the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect between a model ecosystem of non-fixing trees and a model ecosystem with N-fixing trees is the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect attributed to the N-fixing trees and is inherently relative to the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of non-fixing trees. To estimate the magnitude of the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees at the global scale, we parameterized the model for tropical, temperate, and boreal forests, and simulated the model under past (low; pre-Anthropocene
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>
 </sup>), recent (intermediate; 2001
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup> and 2006
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>), and future N deposition rates (high; 2030 for the SRES A2 scenario
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>). The model suggests that N-fixing trees can either mitigate or exacerbate climate change relative to non-fixing trees, contingent on their N fixation strategy and on N deposition. As N deposition intensifies, N-fixing trees stimulate substantial soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions but promote minimal CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration, exacerbating climate change relative to non-fixing trees. The goal of this study is not to generate a quantitatively accurate prediction of the net CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>–N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O effect of N-fixing trees. Rather, the objectives are to estimate its potential magnitude, and to generate and explore hypotheses of how N-fixing trees could mitigate or exacerbate climate change. Ultimately, these hypotheses should be analyzed empirically and with Earth System Models.
