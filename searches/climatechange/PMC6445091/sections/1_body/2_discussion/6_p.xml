Our analysis suggests that a single functional group, N-fixing trees, could decrease the magnitude of this negative radiative forcing of forests by up to 32% as N deposition intensifies. The theoretical modeling approach we employ here is only a basic framework for generating hypotheses and exploring their potential limits. We do not claim to have made accurate predictions for the net CO
