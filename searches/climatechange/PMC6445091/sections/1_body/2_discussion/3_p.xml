 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup> have shown that N-fixing trees can even inhibit the growth of surrounding trees and thus inhibit forest growth. These results could be due to non-N limitation and strong competitive effects of N-fixing trees on surrounding trees, although these mechanisms remain speculative. Further research is necessary to determine the predominance and controls of non-facilitative effects of N-fixing trees on forest growth. Additional studies on how N-fixing trees drive soil N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions are also necessary. It is well established that soil N drives soil N

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions are rare, although they demonstrate that N-fixing trees can substantially increase soil N
