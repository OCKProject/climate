<p class="p">Access to affordable forms of sustainable energy is crucial to the needs of those at the base of the economic pyramid, especially women in rural communities (Ulsrud et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 7. Majority of women in the rural areas in Botswana depend on traditional knowledge on appropriate wood species for fire making. Traditional knowledge that was socially constructed and acquired is an asset to sustainable development endeavours that need to be recorded and legally protected for future generations. Rural communities are dependent on firewood for cooking and heating. It is clear from the findings that sources of firewood tree species are threatened by population expansion and high demand from buyers, and wood is becoming commercialised. It is recommended that woodlots be introduced in affected areas for future firewood supply catering for families off the electricity grid. Low-emission energy investments that are gender-responsive could contribute to increasing womenâ€™s access to modern and clean forms of energy for lighting, cooking, heating and other productive uses. They could increase economic efficiency and productivity gains with less time and physical exertion spent on basic subsistence activities such as wood fuel collection, creating entrepreneurial opportunities and new markets for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises owned by women (Schalatek &amp; Burns 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). The use of more energy-efficient stoves by women and the general public could help reduce the depletion of wood resources. However, the cooking stoves should not only be energy efficient but also produce less smoke to minimise on local air pollution.
