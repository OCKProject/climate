<p class="p">The use of renewable energy is considered as an indispensable component of sustainable development (Uddin &amp; Taplin 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Therefore, energy systems, appropriate strategies and institutional settings are needed to be in place for the poor and vulnerable communities. Access to energy sources and services by women would be one of the economic empowerment strategies that would not only reduce poverty but also accelerate sustainable development. Social protection systems need to be established to enhance the capacity of the poor and the vulnerable people to enable them to better manage risks and shocks (OECD 2012). This article argues that further significant effort could be made towards energy sustainability in Botswana. As Botswana is well positioned in sub-Saharan Africa within the tropics and receives sunlight most of the day times, a solar energy strategy could facilitate access to affordable and clean energy for the benefit of all including women in the rural areas. The mean annual solar insolation is reported to be ‘21 MJ per m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> per day, one of the highest radiation levels in the world’ (Government of the Republic of Botswana 2009:5). It has also emerged that given support, rural women are capable of empowering themselves and becoming resilient to poverty-related situations. Women use social learning approaches to vary the means of their ways of leaving. It is recommended that women in Tswapong area be assisted to use alternative sources of energy to reduce and ultimately avoid use of wood for making fire; use profit generated from women’s entrepreneurial projects to connect to national power grid to avoid the challenges regarding energy access. These would reduce adverse effects of climate change impact and hence reduce energy poverty.
