Besides, 70% of the rural population in the sub-Saharan Africa rely on traditional biomass. As such, most women and children spend hours collecting firewood for domestic use like cooking, heating and lighting. Some rural households use kerosene lamps for lighting that may contribute to pollution. Besides, an average of 540 mg per hour for wick lamps and 300 mg per hour for enclosed lamps is emitted (Practical Action

Furthermore, pollutants from the cheapest kerosene wick stoves have the smallest particle size and are thus the most dangerous because they are taken more deeply into the lungs. Also, people stand the risk of getting affected by smoke when preparing meals and while making fire or sitting around fire to warm themselves (Practical Action, 2013). In some cases people use rudimentary stoves or agricultural residue to produce energy for domestic requirements. These are likely to cause respiratory-related illnesses. Meyrick (
