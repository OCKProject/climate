<p class="p">Fuel wood accounts for 43% of the final energy consumption in the rural areas in Botswana (Wright 
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Access to electricity is low, 31% in rural areas. As rural population increases and land-use activities intensify, more woodland gets degraded and as a result, sources of wood and collection becomes a challenge. Eighty-two per cent of the Serowe-Palapye inhabitants use firewood for heating, while only 16.1% use electricity. ‘The implications for excessive harvesting and use of firewood for heating are … elevated risks of deforestation, land degradation and desertification, and contamination of the environment’ (Statistics Botswana &amp; UNFPA
