<p class="p">Tswapong villages are located in the eastern part of Botswana. The villages lie to the east of the main railway line from north to south, in Serowe-Palapye sub-district and administrative region. There are over 26 villages scattered along the foothills with a total population of over 68 000 inhabitants mainly subsisting on arable agriculture and livestock farming. The area depends on unreliable rainfall that averages between 250 mm and 450 mm per annum. Although almost all the villages have access to the main national electricity grid, not all families afford connections to their homestead because of their economic status. They depend on firewood collected around the settlements and distant areas. The majority of these families are women. This research focused on women in particular because they are more affected by energy poverty.</p>
