<p class="p">Wood sources, particularly tree species that are traditionally used for firewood, have become more scarce in the village neighbourhood because of overexploitation as firewood gets commercialised by those with the means to transport wood from distant areas. Because of firewood commercialisation, some wood collectors end up cutting live trees, leading to land degradation and associated effects such as deforestation and desertification contributing to adverse impact of climate change.</p>
