<p class="p">The Botswana Government ‘overall policy goal for the energy sector is to provide affordable, environmentally friendly and sustainable energy services in order to promote social and economic development’ (Government of the Republic of Botswana 2009:5). The national rural electrification project has seen electricity grid distribution to most parts of the country. In addition, the Government has introduced a subsidised rate of P5000 per household for electricity connection as a policy intervention. However, the majority of the rural poor especially women are still unable to afford the subsidised rate for home electricity connection.</p>
