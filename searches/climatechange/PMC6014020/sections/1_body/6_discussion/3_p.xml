<p class="p">Despite the Government’s effort to connect villages and households to the grid, some women ‘continue to collect and use firewood to cook and boil water for their families’ (Wright

This inability of rural women to afford electricity connections can be resolved by financial mechanism to allow poorer households to pay connection fees; this would not only provide benefits to women-headed households but would also improve profits by increasing the overall connection rate (Schalatek &amp; Burns 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Connections to clean energy sources would create ‘multiple-win’ solutions with economic, development and gender equality co-benefits while significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Above all, making clean energy connections to rural households would reduce on energy poverty. Improving access to energy is becoming more relevant and in demand as a means of improving the lives and livelihoods of the people. It would also transform the local economies and influence the production and consumption pattern in the rural areas for long-term sustainable development goal.
