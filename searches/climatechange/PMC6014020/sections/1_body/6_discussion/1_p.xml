<p class="p">The majority of women in the rural areas use firewood for cooking and heating (CSO

Firewood is becoming inadequate because of high demand within villages and from the neighbouring towns. It is, however, the main source of energy for the rural majority. In the past, firewood collection was done on almost a daily basis by women forming some social groups. This practice is no longer common as people are becoming more individualistic as firewood is obtained from distant areas and has become commercialised, thus affecting socio-economic practices. These affect the rural energy service negatively as majority of the people, especially women, are not employed and hence have no income to purchase wood. Firewood collection leads to environmental degradation. Some respondents noticed this and said ‘it is causing soil erosion as areas get bare and degraded’. Those who can afford alternative sources are supplementing the use of firewood for cooking. As for lighting, they use electricity and paraffin which they report to be expensive for them to buy. Despite the fact that electricity connection to individual household is subsidised, majority of the rural poor are still not able to afford their required contribution. As a result, they keep looking for free or cheaper energy sources such as firewood. However, households that have connected electricity continue using firewood as it is cheaper and helps them reduce on electricity bills. The research respondents claimed that ‘paraffin has become expensive and is often in short supply despite the introduction of the solar lamps and battery charged lights’, which they cannot afford to buy and maintain. This leaves poor people with limited alternatives for preparing meals, heating and providing light.
