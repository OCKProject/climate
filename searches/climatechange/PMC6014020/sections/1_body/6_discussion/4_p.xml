<p class="p">Majority of the research respondents are dependent on climate-sensitive resources (Kapoor, Rai &amp; Chowdhury 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) such as those in the farming sectors and natural products. During droughts they depend more on drought-resistant natural products and crops. However, all these become inadequate during droughts. It has emerged that, as a result of climate change and variability in the area, rainfall is becoming more unreliable and temperatures are becoming more intense, leading to wilting of the crops and wild plants. This indicates that the common capital is affected. As a result, poverty increases, adding to energy poverty. To build resilience to both poverty and climate change impact, a member organisation called Kgetsi-ya-Tsie is empowering its membership with some entrepreneurial skills and encourages them to take advantage of national policies and strategies meant to reduce poverty (Ketlhoilwe &amp; Jeremiah 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). It emerged from the study that most of the women who are members of community-based organisation depend on firewood for cooking and heating in their homes. Some of them would not be able to prepare something to eat without firewood. Overcollection of firewood occurs especially around villages leading to deforestation that contributes to global warming, leading to climate change. This situation is made worse by persistent and high demand for commonly used firewood tree species. As a result of inadequate supply of firewood, the majority of women are left with only two options to get firewood. They either have to travel long distances or to buy from those with donkey carts. While travelling long distances to collect firewood remain a challenge, their purchasing power is even lower during drought years when yield from the field crops is low or their domestic animals could not be sustained as a source of income to purchase firewood. These situations contribute to energy poverty, especially among women-headed household.
