<p class="p">To build resilience and cope with energy poverty, some of the respondents have managed to secure tenders to supply local primary schools with fresh homemade bread. For instance in Ratholo village, two women were supplying a local primary school with fresh bread while in Sefhare Village, a group of women have managed to build an oven for baking bread for sale to schools and the public. However, both groups use firewood for baking bread. These activities are likely to diversify the economy of women in the Tswapong region contributing to community resilience to both adverse impact of poverty and climate change. The challenge women face in diversifying the economy includes that of access to energy sources such as electric power and gas.</p>
