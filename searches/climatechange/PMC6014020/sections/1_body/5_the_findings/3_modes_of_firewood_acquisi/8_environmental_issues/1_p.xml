<p class="p">Climate change has affected annual supply of firewood as a source of energy for households as well as small-scale entrepreneurial activities as all of them are dependent on wood use for cooking, water heating and natural products processing. The research respondents had identified some ways in which climate change has affected wood supply. One respondent said ‘we are experiencing extreme heat and rain has become less frequent, this may lead to wood depletion in the long run’. While another respondent said ‘there is limited regeneration growth among important firewood tree species as a result of varied rainfall pattern’. One woman said ‘we experience heat stroke and some trees may also be getting affected by heat’. Another woman said ‘rainfall pattern is not normal anymore and it is sometimes too heavy and destructive to the vegetation including trees used to obtain firewood’, and one said ‘there are no enough trees for firewood, people cut life trees excessively and without rainfall there is less regeneration of vegetation including trees’.</p>
