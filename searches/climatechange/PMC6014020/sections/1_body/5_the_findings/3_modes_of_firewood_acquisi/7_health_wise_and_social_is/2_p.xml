<p class="p">Traditionally, firewood was collected by women who were socially bounded by often interaction and living within the proximity to each other. This arrangement facilitated social learning among women. Women learnt firewood species and taboo associated with collecting the wrong wood species for use. They also learnt from each other that ‘dry wood was suitable for use especially for cooking rather than wet wood that may produce more smoke and smell’. Women were concerned that ‘proper socialization is now lacking as people now go on their own to collect firewood’. One woman said ‘in the past we used to counsel each other, share ideas, and solve emotional issues during wood collection’. The practices of firewood collection in groups used to encourage friendship. This practice is no longer common as firewood is obtained far and some people have better means of transport to go far distances to collect firewood for use and sale. The social learning process among women in rural areas has now declined and ‘some young women collect wood that they do not even know the name of the tree from which it originates’. This results in women using wood from trees that are a taboo to use for making fire.</p>
