<p class="p">Group discussions were used mainly to acquire information on access to energy sources and services. This required detailed preparation of a checklist of open-ended questions on specific issues surrounding the energy activities being studied. For instance, detailed focus group discussions were held with a group of 10 small-scale commercial egg production women who are members of the Chadibe Poultry Project. Most of the respondents therefore were women who stay in the village, often unemployed and caring for the young and elderly as well as for the dry land field crops. The discussions assisted in obtaining the general understanding of important issues concerning energy in the rural areas, particularly on how it affects their poultry project production and household energy requirements.
