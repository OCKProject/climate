<p class="p">Interviews were conducted to gain an understanding of issues from the perspectives of the interviewees. Semi-structured interviews were used mainly to understand the general perspective of women about the resources therein and challenges to access to energy sources. Semi-structured interviews involved discussion on many issues from specific access to energy sources and services, livelihood activities such as farming or use of natural resources. These were also triangulated by using information generated through focus discussions. Participants of semi-structured interviews were of different age groups including those over 65 years. Rich data were acquired through this method as respondents did not perceive the interviews as questioning sessions but a curious interest in their lives by outsiders. However, when in the field, in many instances more probing had to be done in order to keep engaging the interviewees on access to energy experiences. The semi-structured interviews were found to be useful as they allowed for focused, conversational, two-way communication, and most importantly, it allowed for a fairly open framework which was used both to generate and receive information. Interviews were useful as they assisted in collecting household-level economic data which may have been complex without using this method. These interviews enabled the researcher to deploy the constructivist approach where participants freely articulated their experiences reflecting the reality on the ground.</p>
