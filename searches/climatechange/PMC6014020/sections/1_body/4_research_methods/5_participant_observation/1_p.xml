<p class="p">This method was carried out in the study areas in order to make informed conclusions, gain some insights into the lives of the respondents and their interaction with each other, energy services and resources around them through observations. Visits were made to participants’ homes, firewood collection sites and projects. This proved very useful in understanding the local context. A scheduled visit was done to the Sefhare Village where an oven for baking bread was handed over to a group of women. This helped the researcher to appreciate what it takes to be in an area where firewood is becoming scarce and other sources of energy are not easily accessible. Interaction with women from different villages helped appreciate the challenges faced in trying to collectively or individually to alleviate energy poverty among women. Another observation activity was in the Lerala Village where women were processing and packaging natural herbs and marula oil. The method helped the researcher to explore social and livelihood complexities and to appreciate the need for energy within the factory. Women use the cold press method to extract oil from marula kernels. The process requires manual labour and it is a challenge even to the able-bodied women. It makes the oil production slow and low. It is time–consuming as it was observed that it takes about a day’s work to produce a litre of oil. However, the cold extraction method is still preferred as it produces quality natural marula oil preferred by customers. These observations assisted in the interpretive analysis of women’s access to energy services and experiences.</p>
