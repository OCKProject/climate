<p id="p0260" class="p">Hybrid crops will likely face resistance because of the long tradition of saving and reusing seeds among traditional cultures in Mali and elsewhere. The traditional practice of hand selecting varieties with desirable attributes and replanting them in subsequent seasons (and seed recycling) is ingrained in farmers. Hand selecting crops over time allows them to adapt to local variation in climate and to localized pest and disease outbreaks. Manual seed selection and reusing seed gives farmers control over their own seed supply and buffers them fluctuating seed prices. There is also a great deal of misinformation associated with hybrid crops, and associations with genetic modification of crops that carry a negative stigma in rural parts of Mali (as well as across Africa). The process of hybridization is thus a barrier to the proliferation of the technology. However, because of the yield advantages from hybrids some farmers are likely to incorporate hybrid sorghum varieties into their existing cropping systems alongside traditional or even perennial varieties.</p>
