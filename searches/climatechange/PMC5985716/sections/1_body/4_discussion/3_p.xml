<p id="p0255" class="p">Farmers' main interest appears to be improvement in soil quality from the perennial plant, which is consistent with pigeon pea farmers in Malawi (
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Waldman et al. 2017</xref>). Soil improvement is the most important determinant of farmer choice, approximately three to four times as important as biomass production. The benefits of perenniality in terms of reduced seed and labor requirements appear to be negligible to farmers. While previous research has found that perennial crops improve soil (

 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kell 2011</xref>), there is no evidence of direct soil fertility improvement from perennials since the improvement happens over such a long time horizon. Developing perennial sorghum varieties that are primarily soil enhancing with more extensive root systems and higher above ground biomass is an area where further breeding efforts could increase adoption by farmers. Efforts to improve soil fertility should aim to keep yields within relatively similar to annual sorghum yields in subsequent years of production to remain appealing to farmers. However, since labor and seed requirements are not as important to farmers and distinguishing attributes of a perennial crop there will likely be extensive behavioral barriers to adoption of perennial sorghum in Mali.
