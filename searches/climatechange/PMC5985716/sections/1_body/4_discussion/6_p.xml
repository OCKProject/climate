<p id="p0270" class="p">Anecdotally, sorghum is not traditionally the woman's domain in Mali, although some women grow small plots of sorghum for income generation. Women might not have much decision-making power over the land or the inputs used and so increasing forage and soil through perennial crops could be more appealing to female farmers. Given the prevalence of polygamous households in Mali, women generally have less access to cash and assets and often farm smaller plots of land with fewer resources. For some women, labor may not be a limiting constraint, likely because the plots of land they are farming are so small that they can personally supply enough labor. However, for women farmers with a labor shortage a perennial crop might be an advantage to them since fewer plowings are required. Regardless there is heterogeneous demand for labor savings, so a perennial crop is potentially an important technology for resource-poor women and may provide an important incentive for adoption of sorghum.</p>
