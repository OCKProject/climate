<p id="p0265" class="p">The duration of the plant is important to farmers and there is a strong and homogenous preference for shorter duration crops. This appears to extend to perennial sorghum which had high and significant opt out values among farmers. Seed requirements and labor requirements are the core of the differences between an annual and a sorghum crop and both of these attributes were valued very little by farmers. This suggests that unless perennial crops can make significant ecosystem service contributions, particularly in terms of soil improvements they are not likely to be adapted simply by the different management requirements of the cropping system.</p>
