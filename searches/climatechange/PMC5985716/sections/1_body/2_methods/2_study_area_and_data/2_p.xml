 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> depicts the rainfall gradient and the study sites in Mali. The gradient runs from the southern border with the Ivory Coast, where the highest rainfall occurs (about 1400 mm annually) northeast to the border of the Sahara desert, where rainfall is too low to support crop cultivation (below 400 mm of rainfall per year). This rainfall gradient also extends across the rest of West Africa. There are four main agroecological zones in Mali of which the Sahelian zone and Saharan Zone are too dry to cultivate. Sorghum is cultivated in the southern half of the country in the Subhumid Zone and the Sudanian Savannah, which comprise 6% and 12% of land respectively. In the Sudanian Savannah, the soils are relatively heavy and sorghum is the dominant cereal crop, often rotated with cotton, maize, groundnuts or cowpeas.
