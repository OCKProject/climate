<p id="p0100" class="p">We use a spatially explicit clustered multistage sampling approach to capture variation along the rainfall gradient. Out of the 8 regions in Mali, we select three regions where annual sorghum is cultivated under low, medium, and high rainfall; Sikasso, Koulikoro, and Segou, respectively. Within each region we select one Cercle, which is the second level administrative unit. The selected Cercles were Bougouni, Sikasso; Dioila, Koulikoro; and Tominian, Segou (highlighted in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) and we randomly choose six villages from a list of all villages within each Cercle. Prior to visiting households we received permission from village elders to interview 20 people in each village (approximately 10 men and 10 women) and local guides brought enumerators to houses at an increasing distance from the center of the village. We have a total of 318 complete observations after discarding observations from two villages in Bougoni where there were some problems with initial survey enumeration quality.
