<p id="p0120" class="p">Choice experiments are widely used in the agricultural and environmental economics literature and are increasingly common for understanding preferences in a development context (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bennett and Birol, 2010</xref>). They can be used to understand breeding traits in different production systems (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Roessler et al. 2008</xref>), to estimate willingness to pay for a new agricultural technology (
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Birol et al., 2012</xref>), to preferences for cropping systems (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ortega et al. 2014</xref>), and investigate preferences for environmental adaptability and yield stability (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Asrat et al. 2010</xref>). Numerous studies use choice experiments to evaluate preferences of developing country farmers concerning environmental or ecological tradeoffs involved in agricultural production. Choice experiments were used to estimate demand for perennial pigeon pea in Malawi (
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Waldman et al. 2017</xref>), and they have also been used to estimate Mexican farmers' preferences for biodiversity in their cropping systems (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Birol et al. 2009</xref>). Choice experiments were used in the analysis of tradeoffs regarding pineapple production and environmental management in Costa Rica (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Richardson et al. 2013</xref>), and to value incentives to households that communally manage natural resources (
