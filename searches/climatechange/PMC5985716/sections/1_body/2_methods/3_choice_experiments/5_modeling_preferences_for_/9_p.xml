<p id="p0165" class="p">Other factors identified as critical tradeoffs concerning annual versus perennial sorghum was the reduction in seed and labor requirements resulting from a single planting with multiple harvests. We also model the benefits of perennial sorghum, which theoretically include soil improvement from more extensive perennial root growth, and higher levels of biomass/forage, since less energy is required for root development. We assume that breeders can reach a point where perennial sorghum can reliably survive the dry season and regenerate but that on average the yield of perennial sorghum is lower than traditional sorghum. With hybrid sorghum, we assume less seed is required, the price of the seed is higher than traditional sorghum seed, and the seeds cannot be reused in subsequent years. Furthermore, we assume that there are multiple plant durations of hybrid sorghum, and the grain yield of hybrid sorghum is higher on average than traditional sorghum.</p>
