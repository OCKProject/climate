<p id="p0130" class="p">We design two choice experiments, one examines preferences for hybrid sorghum and the other examines preferences for perennial sorghum. In both, we assume a farmer chooses between perennial or hybrid and annual sorghum, and we assume that farmers seek to maximize the utility derived from their cropping decision. We use random parameters logit (RPL) model that allows us to control for the standard deviation in the choice attributes. We are interested in exploring the heterogeneity among preferences of individuals as opposed to a latent class approach, which involves identification of groups of farmers that are heterogeneous across classes and homogenous within a group. We explicitly want to understand how individual preferences differ, particularly along gender lines. An RPL model with interaction effects between the choice attributes and the gender variable is more consistent with this aim than a model such as the covariance heterogeneity model which allows for scale to be a function of attributes.</p>
