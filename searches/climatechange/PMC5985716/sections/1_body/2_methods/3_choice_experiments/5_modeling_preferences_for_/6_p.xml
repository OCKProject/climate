<p id="p0150" class="p">The most important tradeoffs and design attributes of the choice sets for annual, perennial, and hybrid sorghum production were estimated from a combination of literature review, informal discussion with breeders, and a series of focus groups with farmers in Mali in October 2014. We also consulted with local agronomists and experts in legume cultivation in Mali to design the parameters for the choice experiment. We identified the main attributes to be used in the choice experiments through informal interviews with farmers and consultation with agronomists and made a series of modeling assumptions based on these interviews.</p>
