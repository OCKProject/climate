<p id="p0145" class="p">We estimate perennial and hybrid sorghum models in both preference space and willingness-to-pay (WTP) space. The coefficients on the attributes in the preference space model reflect the marginal utility of each attribute to an individual and the ratio of two marginal utilities is the marginal rate of substitution of one attribute for another. The advantage of estimating a model in WTP-space is that one can estimate the marginal rate of substitution directly (

 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ortega et al. (2016)</xref>, we estimate WTP for choice attributes in terms of the amount of crop yield an individual would be willing to substitute for each of the other attributes.
