 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smale et al. (2016)</xref> calculate the unit variable cost of traditional (annual) sorghum to be 125 CFA/kg producing an average of 950 kg/ha, improved sorghum to be 105 CFA/kg producing an average of 1500 kg/ha and hybrid sorghum the lowest at 65 CFA/kg or 2500 kg/ha.
 <xref rid="fn0010" ref-type="fn" class="xref">2</xref> Based on these figures we model the choice between a traditional and perennial crop (or hybrid crop) as a reduction (or increase) in yield based roughly on the variation in current versus previous yield of traditional varieties and the percentage range observed for perennial or hybrid to traditional. The values of the parameters were wide enough to capture both the high and low ends of the spectrum.
