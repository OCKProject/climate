<p id="p0175" class="p">Cropping system attributes used in the perennial choice experiment included seed requirements, labor requirements, forage quantity, soil improvement, and sorghum yield. Cropping system attributes and their levels are described below in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. We modeled the variation in seed requirements as ranging from the same requirements as their current varieties to 15% and 30% reductions to capture the lower amounts of seeds required for perennial cultivation. We treated labor as a binary variable (low and high) since there is such wide variation in labor availability across farms and regions. Perennial crops tend to produce much higher levels of above-ground biomass since they have to devote less energy to root production after establishment, and so we have also modeled this variable as a binary choice to avoid misleading amounts, since we do not have accurate quantification of levels of biomass from perennial sorghum. Similarly, we modeled soil improvement as a binary variable since one of the often-stated benefits of perennial crops is long-term soil improvement from the additional carbon resulting from the larger root mass, although we do not have empirical evidence of the magnitude. Modeling attributes as binary that are continuous is a significant limitation of the study but in the absence of detailed empirical estimates this approach allows us to evaluate how important this attribute is to farmers.
