<p id="p0235" class="p">Model results of preferences for hybrid sorghum are presented in 
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>. The same three models are presented: an RPL choice model, an RPL model with gender interactions, and a model with gender interactions estimated in WTP space. One important difference in the way the choice sets are constructed is that the hybrid sorghum yield variable is framed as an increase in yield compared to traditional sorghum whereas perennial was framed as a yield reduction. In the perennial model a positive valuation of yield can be interpreted as how much of a yield reduction a participant would be willing to accept while the interpretation of yield in the hybrid sorghum model is how much the respondent values a percentage increase in yield. Also in the perennial model the seed requirements variable is framed as a percentage of seed required (since less seed is required with perennial but it is not clear exactly how much) whereas in the hybrid model we specifically capture the seeding rate difference using experimental data (hybrid sorghum has a higher germination rate and so only one half the amount of seed is required).
