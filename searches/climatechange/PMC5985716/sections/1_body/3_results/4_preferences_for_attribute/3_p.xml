<p id="p0240" class="p">The respondent is presented with a choice that is not explicitly hybrid versus non-hybrid sorghum but rather two choices that differ in attributes that characterize the main differences between hybridized and non-hybridized sorghum crops. Seed requirements are not an important component of the tradeoff to farmers and there is little variation in this preference. Sorghum maturity is important, indicated by the significant tradeoff value and there is a significant and homogenous preference for shorter duration sorghum. The ability to reuse the seed is the most important attribute to participants in the choice, approximately 6 times more important than earlier maturity. On average women put slightly less emphasis on the ability to reuse seed than their male counterparts (seen in the RPL model), but there is significant variation within this group and this effect washes out in the WTP-space model.</p>
