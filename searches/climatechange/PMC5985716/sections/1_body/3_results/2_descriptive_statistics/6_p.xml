<p id="p0210" class="p">Sixty-three percent of farmers are aware of the concept of perennial sorghum but only 1% of the sample had tried it. Only 17% of the sample has tried “improved” varieties. Eighty-nine percent of the sample use sorghum residue as forage, 60% collect the residue and transport it to the animals, while 40% leave the residue in the field. Almost all of the farmers sampled (92%) source seed from their own production. Anecdotally, women do not have access to draft power when they needed it because the men use it for the main fields. However, in our sample, 80% of women reported having access to draft animals (and 90% of men) with slightly lower reporting not having access to draft animals when they needed it (78% of women and 85% of men).</p>
