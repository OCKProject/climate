<p id="p0200" class="p">We asked farmers a series of questions related to sorghum cultivation and use (see 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In our sample, average rainfall and percentage of farmers growing sorghum is inversely related— the lower the rainfall the higher the percentage of farmers producing sorghum. However, the largest mean land area planted to sorghum was in Dioïla (3.69 ha). There was wide variation in reported yield per hectare with the highest figures in the highest rainfall areas but the standard deviations were large and so these figures are not statistically different from one another. The total quantity consumed and sold was higher in the higher rainfall areas but the percent of the harvest consumed was smaller when more sorghum was harvested (86%, 94%, and 95% in Bougoni, Dioïla, and Tominian respectively). There is a relatively high level of intercropping with sorghum (about 50%) with the most in Dioïla and least in Tominian. The vast majority of the sorghum that was intercropped was intercropped with cowpea (89%).
