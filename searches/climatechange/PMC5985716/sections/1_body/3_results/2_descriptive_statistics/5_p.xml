<p id="p0205" class="p">It is common that women in Mali will manage land separate from the main agricultural fields, producing small amounts of cereal crops for household consumption or sale. These cereals are often intercropped with women's primary crops, such as cowpea or groundnut. Since males head the UPA, when we interviewed them we asked them to report all of the sorghum they managed under the UPA while women were asked only to report the land that they managed personally. In some UPAs, there was sorghum cultivation taking place that was not managed by the women and of which they were not aware, so the figures presented above roughly illustrate the differences between the three sites but may not be precise estimates of total sorghum production. This is a function of the polygamous household structure and a major hurdle to collecting “household” level production data in Mali. Since we are interested in factors that impact individual decisions regarding sorghum production we thought it was more appropriate to ask respondents only about the land that they personally manage rather than interview married husband and wife pairs.</p>
