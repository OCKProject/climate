<p id="p0220" class="p">We use the yield variable to calculate the marginal rate of substitution, and this is framed as a percentage reduction in the level of a respondent's sorghum harvest from the previous growing season (−60%, −40%, −20%, the same). A positive valuation of yield can be understood as how much of a yield reduction a participant would be willing to tradeoff (or accept) to have higher levels of an attribute (e.g., soil improvement). Since seed requirements are also framed as a reduction in level (average, 15% less or 30% less), a positive sign on this variable indicates a positive valuation of a reduction in seed required. Labor requirements, forage biomass, and soil improvement are all binary variables so a positive sign would indicate the difference in valuation from the low to high level. Coefficients in the WTP-space model should be interpreted as tradeoff values relative to other attributes in terms of sorghum yield. Note that the coefficient listed for yield in WTP-space is the associated preference space estimate.</p>
