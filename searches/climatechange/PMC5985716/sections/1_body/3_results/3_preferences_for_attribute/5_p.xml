<p id="p0230" class="p">As forage increases from low to high there is a positive and significant valuation but the random parameter estimate for this is not significant suggesting that this is not important to all farmers. The tradeoff value for soil improvement indicates that this attribute is roughly three times more important to farmers than forage/biomass production. In the RPL model yield is positive and significant as is the random parameter standard deviation and there is some heterogeneity in yield valuation. The opt out dummy is negative and very large and significant for perennial sorghum, indicating that many respondents prefer traditional sorghum over perennial.</p>
