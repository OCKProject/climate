<p id="p0225" class="p">The value of the coefficient on seed requirements is small, about 0.5 CFA (or about $0.005) per 1% of sorghum yield, suggesting that this attribute is a minor concern relative to the other attributes involved in the choice of the sorghum variety. Labor requirements are negative but not significant, indicating that labor requirements are not necessarily an important determinant of the choice between an annual and perennial sorghum variety overall. The random parameter standard deviation on labor is significant and relatively large however, indicating that there is heterogeneity in labor valuation. In the RPL with interactions model the value of labor to women is positive and marginally significant, based on the coefficient of the interaction between the gender and labor variables, indicating that women are less concerned than men about labor savings. This effect however washes out in the WTP model when coefficients are scaled.</p>
