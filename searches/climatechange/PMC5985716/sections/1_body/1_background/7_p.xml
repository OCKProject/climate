<p id="p0090" class="p">Hybrid and perennial crops present different tradeoffs to farmers and this paper examines farmers' preferences for these different cropping systems and the associated attributes of each using choice experiments. We employ two sets of choice experiments to look at farmers' preferences for attributes of perennial and hybrid crops using the case of sorghum in Mali. We also chose to design the study with a gender focus since the structure of households in Mali is such that most male and female farmers manage agricultural land independently and are likely have independent preferences for crop attributes. We are most interested in the heterogeneity in preferences, with specific attention paid to differences by gender of the respondent so that we are able to characterize the relationship between crop duration and gender.</p>
