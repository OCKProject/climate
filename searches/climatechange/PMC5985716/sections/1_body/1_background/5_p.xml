<p id="p0080" class="p">Perennial lines of sorghum have only recently been tested in Mali and are at this point still hypothetical to farmers. The primary tradeoff with perennial crops is yield reduction since most perennial crops yield less than their annual counterparts (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pimentel et al. 2012</xref>). For this reason, efforts to develop perennial wheat in developed countries have focused on improved grain yield, and to a lesser extent grain quality (

 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jaikumar et al. 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayes et al. 2012</xref>). There are numerous advantages to perennial crops such as lower seed inputs since they require reseeding every three to five years as opposed to every year like annual crops (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bell et al. 2008</xref>). Less tillage also translates into less soil disturbance and erosion. As a result, the farm labor costs, energy usage, and technological inputs required for yearly tillage will significantly decrease in perennial crop systems (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pimentel et al. 2012</xref>). Additionally, the large root mass helps retain soil, prevent future erosion, sequester more carbon, and hold more soil water (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Glover et al. 2010</xref>). Perennial cropping systems also have natural mechanisms that make them more resilient to pests (

 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cox et al. 2006</xref>). Perennial systems have more soil fauna diversity and natural below ground processes since they have more year-round vegetation (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Culman et al. 2013</xref>). Perennials are also more efficient than annual crops at absorbing nutrients, so fertilizer requirements are lower and nutrient leaching is reduced.
