<p id="p0085" class="p">Perennial crops present attributes and management requirements that are very different from the attributes of the hybrid varieties more commonly found in breeding programs. In many ways, perennial crops are the antithesis of the typical hybrid crop variety, which is often input-intensive, early maturing, and high yielding. Perennial crops are not necessarily high yielding, they have lower labor requirements and are longer duration, but they may be more amenable to the low-input, low-output farm management style in Africa. Perennials are adaptable to climate change through extensive root growth that permits greater access to water and nutrients during dry spells, and they are thus often associated with improved agricultural ecosystem services. Hybrid varieties on the other hand tend to be bred to fit into a new and different cropping system that is characterized by more variable rain or a shorter growing season. Early maturing hybrids can avoid changing climatic conditions and variable rainfall by through crossbreeding with varieties that are short duration. Hybrids can also be bred for tolerance to temporal midseason drought and dry spells, and are often associated with adaptation to climate change.</p>
