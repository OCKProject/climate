Hybridized versions of crops can address specific problems that plague farmers by breeding in pest or disease resistance, drought tolerance, resistance to abiotic stress that may problematic in a given region. Hybrid breeding, particularly with maize in Africa, has focused on improving low yields, but also more recently on developing shorter duration varieties that are more suitable for shortened growing seasons in many regions. There are drawbacks with hybrid crops, notably that hybridized seed tends to be more expensive and can only be planted once before hybrid vigor is lost. Hybrid crops also tend to require greater fertilizer inputs than local varieties to achieve their yield benefits. However, research has shown that despite the higher inputs costs, hybrid crops can return more per acre because of the greater yield advantage, which is true of hybrid sorghum in Mali (
