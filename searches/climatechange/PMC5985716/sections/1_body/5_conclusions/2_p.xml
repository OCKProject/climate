<p id="p0275" class="p">Attributes of both perennial and hybrid varieties are positively valued by farmers and the technologies could be considered as complementary and part of a risk diversification strategy for smallholder farmers in Africa. There are constraints to widespread adoption of either technology, which highlights the importance of understanding the tradeoffs between agricultural ecosystem services and climate change adaptation. These findings have important policy implications for adaptation to climate change. This is particularly true of perennial grain crops that have not been well developed in the region or on the continent. Hybrids also face numerous behavioral barriers and in particular the hybridization process runs contrary to cultural drivers of seed choice, specifically the prevalence of seed reuse or recycling. To be consistent with farmers' preferences, breeding efforts in Africa should continue to focus on crop diversity and diversification into crops other than maize to provide risk averse farmers with more options which fit their agro climatic conditions and individual farming systems.</p>
