<p id="p0285" class="p">Developing perennial lines of sorghum that can survive the dry seasons in Mali could be a very important technology for climate change adaptation. Enhancing and documenting the ecosystem services and other ancillary benefits provided by perennial crops will be key to farmer adoption. Early maturing hybrids are also a promising technology to reduce exposure to climate risk and adapt to changing climatic conditions. Working with farmers to produce hybrid seed at the local level is one potential way to both create a local market for hybrids and to enable farmers to create a sustainable and appealing seed system that involves hybrids.</p>
