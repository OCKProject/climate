<p id="p0280" class="p">Breeders should be mindful of the two major findings of these experiments. The first is that perennial crops have little appeal to farmers unless they can provide substantial ecological benefits. The ability to grow in drier climates is a potentially very powerful aspect of perennial crops in a future characterized by rising temperatures and greater variability in precipitation. Increased forage biomass and improved soil fertility from perennial crops is promising to farmers, but only at a relatively small yield reduction. The second major finding is that acceptability of hybrid crops is largely hampered by the ability to recycle the seeds. Farmers value shorter duration crops, but this is far outweighed by their aversion to seeds they cannot recycle.</p>
