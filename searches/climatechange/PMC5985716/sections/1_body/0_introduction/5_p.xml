<p id="p0045" class="p">Hybrid crops and perennial crops represent two radically different technologies which each have the potential to improve farmers' ability to adapt to variable climatic conditions. Through hybridization, desirable traits from diverse germplasm may be crossed with traditional landraces in order to create more productive varieties and varieties that combine useful traits, such as disease resistance, with regionally adapted and accepted plant morphology. Development of early maturing hybrid varieties of crops is a common way to reduce exposure to climate variability by reducing the amount of time a crop is in the field.</p>
