 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lobell et al. 2008</xref>). Climate change is expected to have a direct impact on food production as changes to both temperature and rainfall patterns affect crop yields, water availability, pests and diseases, and livestock health, and smallholder farming systems in Africa (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al. 2017</xref>). Countries in sub-Saharan Africa are predicted to be worst affected due to already high temperatures, high dependency on rain-fed agriculture, and economic fragility. The problem is particularly acute in West Africa, where the dual forces of population growth and climate change are likely to exacerbate the persistent challenge of food insecurity. West Africa is also subject to significant rainfall variability and drought occurrences, and this is expected to increase as climate change impacts the region (
