 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ICRISAT, 2015</xref>). Despite these benefits, agricultural policies concerning subsidies and crop improvement have been inconsistent and often do not target sorghum. In the past two decades, domestic production has increased at an average rate of about 1% for sorghum, while maize has increased at an average rate of about 7% (
