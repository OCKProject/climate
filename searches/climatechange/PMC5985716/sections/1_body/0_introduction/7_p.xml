<p id="p0055" class="p">There has been little research to date on preferences for crop duration—or more specifically household-level tradeoffs and preferences for long duration or perennial crops versus short duration, early maturing hybrids—and the prospects for using these technologies for climate adaptation. The literature on the economics of and preferences for perennial crop production in Africa is thin, largely because the development of perennial crops is in a nascent stage. Most of the literature focuses on plant physiology or developing breeding lines that have the capacity to regrow post-harvest and produce yield over successive years (

Breeding programs in Africa target a variety of crops from maize and beans to lesser-known or more traditional crops like sorghum and millet but little attention has been paid to the tradeoffs involved with perennial version of these crops.
