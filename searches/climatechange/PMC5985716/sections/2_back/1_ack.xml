  <p id="p0295" class="p">We would like to thank Alpha Kergna from Institut d'Economie Rurale who helped organize and lead the fieldwork for this project. The research design benefited from discussions with Dr. Eva Weltzein at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in Bamako and Dr. Sieglinde Snapp at Michigan State University. We extend thanks to Dr. Krista Isaacs at ICRISAT for helpful comments on an early draft. We also would like to express our gratitude to the Malian farmers who graciously welcomed us and were willing to speak with us.</p>
