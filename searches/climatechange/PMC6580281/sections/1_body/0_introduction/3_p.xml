<p class="p">Most studies of historical climate changes have focused on macroorganisms (Ma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Normand et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Svenning et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), while the effect of historical climate changes on microorganisms has received little attention (Capo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Delgado‐Baquerizo, Bissett, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Previous studies found that a direct effect of paleoclimate on microbial communities might have occurred in the past (e.g., in response to a severe climatic event), but if the microbial communities response to past climatic change slowly which lead to the consequences of this compositional shift might still be detectable today (Capo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Delgado‐Baquerizo, Bissett, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). For example, Delgado‐Baquerizo, Bissett, et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) found that paleoclimate explained a unique proportion of the variation in soil bacterial richness and community composition across a global scale.
