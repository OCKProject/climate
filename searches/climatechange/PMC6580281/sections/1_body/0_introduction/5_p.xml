<p class="p">The late Quaternary climate oscillations in some areas were mild, promoting assemblages with certain community compositions, while others are unstable, tending to select for a different set of communities (Svenning et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In general, the temperate region encountered repeated glaciations and a generally cool climate during the Quaternary period, while tropic–subtropical regions were less influenced by glacial cooling, resulting in stronger late Quaternary climate oscillations in temperate regions than in tropic–subtropical areas (Feng, Mao, Sandel, Swenson, &amp; Svenning,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), the late Quaternary climate change may similarly have a stronger effect on the soil fungal community (either directly or indirectly via impacts on plant communities) in temperate than in tropic–subtropical regions. In addition, contemporary environmental variables including climate, plant community structure, and soil physicochemical properties vary from temperate to tropic regions, and these changes result in different fungal biogeographical patterns across ecosystems (Andrew et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). For example, saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal communities have shown contrasting biogeographical patterns driven by different environmental variables from temperate to tropic forests (Andrew et al.,
