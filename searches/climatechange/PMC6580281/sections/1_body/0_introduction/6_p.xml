<p class="p">Forest ecosystems are widely distributed across temperate, subtropical, and tropic regions in China, and they differ widely in plant community composition and diversity. They also encompass a wide range of soil types and climate zones (López‐Pujol &amp; Ren,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In this study, we investigated soil fungal communities in Chinese temperate, subtropical, and tropic forests from the north to the south (geographic distance up to ~5,500 km) using Illumina MiSeq sequencing to test the following questions (a) late Quaternary climate change affects fungal community composition and fungal richness, (b) late Quaternary climate change influences the fungal community composition of temperate forests more than that of tropic–subtropical forests, and (c) the main contemporary environmental factors affecting fungal community in the different forests are different.
