<p class="p">This study is the first to show the effect of late Quaternary climate change on soil fungal community composition. Fungal richness was not affected by the late Quaternary climate change, which is inconsistent with the effect of late Quaternary climate change on bacterial diversity. It might be potentially owing to the different traits, such as resistant ability to climatic changes in bacteria and fungi. Late Quaternary climate change influenced fungal community composition and with a stronger signature in temperate forests than in tropicâ€“subtropical forests, which is similar to the effect of late Quaternary climate change on the macroorganism communities. This finding indicates that late Quaternary climatic change can be used to better understand the maintaining mechanism of current soil fungal community composition. Thus, climatic legacy effect should be considered in predicating the soil fungal community composition when assessing the responses of these communities, and the ecosystem services that they provide, to ongoing climate changes.</p>
