<p class="p">The final SEMs showed that total plant species richness had a direct effect on total, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungal richness in all forests, and on total and saprotrophic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). EM plant species richness had a direct effect on EM fungal richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Soil PC1 had a direct effect on total, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungal richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests; in contrast, soil PC2 had a direct effect on saprotrophic and pathogenic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Taking these findings from the linear mixed‐effects models and SEMs analyses as a whole, none of the variables describing late Quaternary climate change had significant effects on total and functional group fungal richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests.
