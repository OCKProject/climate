<p class="p">The OTU richness of total, saprotrophic, EM, and pathogenic fungi was 3,812 ± 171, 1,624 ± 111, 919 ± 50.8, and 170 ± 13.7 (site average ± standard deviation) in temperate forest and 4,214 ± 595, 1,798 ± 111, 740 ± 85.3, and 229 ± 55.1 in tropic–subtropical forest. The random forest models for samples across all forest types showed that the most important variable for total fungal richness, as well as richness of saprotrophic and pathogenic fungi, was soil PC1 and followed by total plant species richness, while the most important variable of EM fungal richness was EM plant species richness (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For samples from tropic–subtropical forest, the most important variable of total, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungal richness was soil PC1 and followed by total plant species richness, but for samples from temperate forest the most important variables of total, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungal richness were soil PC1 and/ or soil PC2 in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). However, the most important variable of EM fungal richness was EM plant species richness in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The linear mixed‐effects models showed that total fungal richness was mainly determined by total plant species richness and soil PC1, and the same is true for saprotrophic and pathogenic fungal richness, while EM fungal richness was largely determined by EM plant species richness across all forests (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Furthermore, total and saprotrophic fungal richness were significantly related to soil PC1 in temperate forest, but to soil PC1 and interaction between total plant species richness and soil PC1 in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In addition to soil PC1, pathogenic fungal richness was significantly related to soil PC2 in tropic–subtropical forest, but not in temperate forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). However, EM fungal richness was significantly related to EM plant species richness in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
