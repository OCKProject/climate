<p class="p">The variation partitioning showed that 29.1%–31.9%, 33.1%–44.3%, 10.0%–42.1%, and 25.1%–35.5% of the variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Furthermore, paleoclimate explained higher variance in community compositions of total (31.6% vs. 13.8%), saprotrophic (30.8% vs. 10.3%), pathogenic (10.3% vs. 10.1%), and EM (29.0% vs. 14.1%) fungi in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Some contemporary environmental variables explaining total and functional group fungal community compositions were different in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). For example, in addition to soil PC1, geographic distance, current climate and total plant community composition, total, and saprotrophic fungal community compositions were explained by soil PC2 in temperate forest but by soil PC3 and PC4 in tropic–subtropical forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Besides soil PC1, geographic distance, and current climate, pathogenic fungal community composition was related to total plant community composition, soil PC3, and PC4 in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). In addition to EM plant community composition, current climate, and geographic distance, EM fungal community composition was related to non‐EM plant community composition, soil PC1, and PC2 in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>).
