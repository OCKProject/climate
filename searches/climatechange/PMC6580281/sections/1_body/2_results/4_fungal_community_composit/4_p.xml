<p class="p">The final SEMs for samples from temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests types demonstrated that paleoclimate, current climate, and space had direct effects on total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Furthermore, for samples from temperate and tropic–subtropical forests paleoclimate, current climate and space had indirect effects on total and saprotrophic fungal community compositions through total plant community composition and soil (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). The same trend was observed when all forest types were analyzed together (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). EM fungal community composition was affected indirectly by paleoclimate, current climate, and space through EM and non‐EM plant community compositions and soil in tropic–subtropical and all forests, but through EM plant community composition and soil (via EM plant community composition) in temperate forest (Figure

 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>). Pathogenic fungal community composition was affected indirectly by paleoclimate, current climate, and space through total plant community composition and soil in tropic–subtropical and all forests, but not in temperate forest (Figure
