<p class="p">PerMANOVA for samples from temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests types revealed that 89.6%–94.6%, 89.4%–94.2%, 42.6%–87.4%, and 57.2%–78.6% of the variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental variables (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Furthermore, paleoclimate explained higher variance in community compositions of total (89.6% vs. 0.4%), saprotrophic (89.5% vs. 2.6%), pathogenic (42.6% vs. 3.2%), and EM (48.6% vs. 4.6%) fungi in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Some contemporary environmental variables explaining total and functional group fungal community compositions were different in temperate and tropic–subtropical forests (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). For example, in addition to total plant community composition, saprotrophic fungal community composition was explained by soil PC2 in temperate forest but not in tropic–subtropical forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). Pathogenic fungal community composition was explained by total plant community composition, PCNM (PCNM1‐3), and soil (PC1‐3) in tropic–subtropical forest but not in temperate forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). In addition to EM plant community composition, EM fungal community composition was explained by non‐EM plant community composition and PCNM (PCNM1‐3) in tropic–subtropical forest, but not in temperate forest (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35247-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>).
