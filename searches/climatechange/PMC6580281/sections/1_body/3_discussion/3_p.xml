<p class="p">We found that total and functional group fungal richness were significantly affected by contemporary environmental factors, such as soil nutrients, pH, and/or plant species richness in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests, as reported in some previous studies (Gao et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, we found that the interaction between total plant species richness and soil (nutrients and pH) affected the total and saprotrophic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest. It is highly possible that plants can modify soil environments through litter or root exudates and soil environments can affect plants in ways resulting in plant–soil feedback that can influence total and saprotrophic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forest (Erlandson, Wei, Savage, Cavender‐Bares, &amp; Peay, 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In addition, the soil C effect on pathogenic fungal richness in tropic–subtropical forests may be because soil C was linked to the plant species diversity in tropic forests (Hooper et al.,
