<p class="p">Furthermore, we found that late Quaternary climate change had a higher effect on the total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest, which is consistent with the effect of late Quaternary climate change on macroorganism community composition (Feng et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This may be because late Quaternary climate change was stronger in temperate regions than in tropic–subtropical areas (Feng et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Across the study sites, paleoclimatic variations (MAT velocity, MAP velocity, MAT anomaly, and MAP anomaly) were 83.6%–148% higher in temperate forest than in tropic–subtropical forest (Table

Furthermore, the complex topography in tropic–subtropical forests may have buffered this region against historical climate changes (López‐Pujol &amp; Ren, 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), resulting in a smaller effect of late Quaternary climate change on the fungal community composition. Besides, higher Quaternary climate oscillations in the unstable areas would result in a more phylogenetically clustered plant community (Kissling et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which influences soil fungal community composition (Barberán et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The importance of this result lies in the fact that late Quaternary climate change can be used to better understand and predict the response of soil fungal community composition to future climate changes.
