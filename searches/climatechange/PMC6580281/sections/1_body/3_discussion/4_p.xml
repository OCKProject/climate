<p class="p">Our results showed that total and functional group fungal community compositions were affected by late Quaternary climate change in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Similarly, fungal community composition in the sediment of two European lakes was related to the past two millennia of paleoclimatic variations (Capo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The relationship between late Quaternary climate change and soil fungal community composition may be caused by altering the relative abundance of fungi (Capo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), as reported in previous studies that regions where the late Quaternary climate oscillations were similar tend to promote assemblages with similar certain community compositions (Svenning et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This also suggests that Quaternary climatic oscillations may produce disequilibrium with current climate if species that were favored under historical conditions but not the current conditions are extirpated slowly, or if species favored by the new conditions are slow to colonize (Svenning &amp; Sandel, 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Alternatively, the influence of late Quaternary climate change was mediated by effects on the plant community (Feng et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and soil (Delgado‐Baquerizo, Eldridge, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), which in turn drive changes in fungal community composition (Nguyen, Williams, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Tedersoo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35247-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), as our SEMs demonstrated (Figure
