  <p class="p">Relative contribution of the different predictors used to model total and functional group fungal community compositions in temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Panels represent results from variation partitioning modelling aiming to identify the percentage variance of total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungal community compositions explained by paleoclimatic and contemporary environmental (current climate, space, plant, and soil) variables in the temperate, tropic–subtropical, and all forests. Unique and shared variance from the current climate, spatial, plant, and soil variables in predicting total, saprotrophic, pathogenic, and EM fungal community compositions were merged in this figure for simplicity. Note that the variation explained by “paleoclimate + contemporary environment” is additional to the one explained either by paleoclimate only or contemporary environment only. An alternative version of this figure showing the unique and shared variance of each group of predictors can be found in Figure
