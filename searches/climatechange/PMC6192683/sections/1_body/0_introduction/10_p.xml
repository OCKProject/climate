<p class="p">The SNPP satellite was launched on 28 October 2011 onto an afternoon orbit with the ascending LECT at 13:30 p.m. This orbit has been fixed using onboard propulsion at its original time with a drifting error of less than 10 min throughout the SNPP operation from its launch time until the present (

Up to the present, the SNPP/ATMS has more than 6 years of overlapping observations with AMSU-A on several polar-orbiting satellites that are still operational. Among these satellites, the NASA Aqua also has a stable orbit with its ascending LECT fixed at close to 13:30 p.m. throughout its operations since its launch on 4 May 2002 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). In operations for more than 10 years and far exceeding their 5-year design life, most Aqua and MetOp-A AMSU-A channels are still in excellent working conditions. The fact that SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A have the same local observation time provides an excellent opportunity to examine their radiometric stability, because diurnal drift effects are absent between the two observations during their entire overlapping period.
