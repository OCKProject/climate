<p class="p">Lower-stratospheric contamination was not the only factor that caused the inconsistencies between the warming surface and the near-zero temperature trends in the lower and middle troposphere in the initial study. With more investigation, researchers found that residual biases remained after satellite data processing and these biases influence MSU-derived long-term trends. It is now well understood that four types of errors could result in spurious temperature trends from satellite observations. The first is the sampling error that occurs when different satellites sample Earth at different local times due to their deployment in different sun-synchronous orbits. This problem also afflicts individual satellites as their orbits drift with satellite aging (

The magnitudes of temperature diurnal cycles in the lower and middle troposphere are large over the land area. If not or wrongly corrected, the temperature diurnal differences due to different observation time can become aliased with the long-term satellite time series, causing spurious trends in the satellite observations (
