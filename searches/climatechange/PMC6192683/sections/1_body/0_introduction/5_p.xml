<p class="p">The second error source is the decrease in satellite orbital altitudes, which originates from drags on the spacecraft from the solar ultraviolet radiative heating (

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>). For temperature of the lower troposphere, the different warming rates between the near-nadir and near-limb observations introduce a spurious cooling trend to the final time series. This effect is negligible for temperature of the mid-troposphere, which is derived from averages of the near-nadir views.
