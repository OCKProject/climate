<p class="p">With efforts over more than two decades, researchers developed various algorithms for removing errors, as described above (

 </xref>â€“

 </xref>). With improved algorithms, satellite-derived tropospheric temperature trends show better agreement in the latest versions developed by different research groups compared to their earlier versions. Specifically, the mid-tropospheric temperature trends from two of three research groups agree with each other quite well (

  <italic class="italic">17</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). However, trend differences still exist due to differences in algorithms selected in developing temperature time series by different research groups.
