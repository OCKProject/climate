<p class="p">Accurate determination of long-term global temperature trends is critically important for the climate science community as well as the public to understand how anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions have influenced global climate change. It also provides an observational record for validating climate model simulations of climate changes in the past, building confidence for the climate models to predict climate changes in the future. Such a capability will ultimately help society to develop informed policies on climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
