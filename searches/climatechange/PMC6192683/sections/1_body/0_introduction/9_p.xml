<p class="p">The situation has changed completely with the next-generation U.S. microwave sounder, the Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS). The ATMS is currently being flown on the NOAA/NASA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) satellite and the NOAA-20 [Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) before launch] and to be flown on future JPSS platforms. The ATMS is a total power cross-track radiometer with 22 channels, combining all the channels of the heritage sensors into a single sensor that spans from 23 to 183 GHz for atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings. The ATMS temperature-sounding channels have exactly the same channel frequencies for most channels, except for channel 4, as its predecessor, the AMSU-A (

This is a critical feature of the instrument design that allows temperatures of the same atmospheric layers to be measured continuously from the past to the present and onward to the future. With these characteristics, errors due to channel frequency differences are not to be expected between ATMS and AMSU-A, unlike in the case between the first (MSU) and second (AMSU-A) generations of the microwave sounders.
