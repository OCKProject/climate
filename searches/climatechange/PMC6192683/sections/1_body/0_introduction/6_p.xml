<p class="p">The third error source is from the satellite calibration, a process that converts the signals received by a satellite antenna in the form of electric voltage counts to radiances emitted by Earth that are used for geophysical applications. The designed calibration uncertainty estimate for satellite microwave sounders is 0.5 to 1 K. Constant calibration errors do not affect trend estimates because they are cancelled out by time derivative. However, calibration errors may drift over time due to changes in calibration nonlinearity (

Recalibration aiming to remove these errors must be conducted in order for observations from different satellites to be able to reliably detect temperature trends (
