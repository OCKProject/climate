<p class="p">The fourth error source is from changes in channel frequencies in different generations of the microwave sounders. The MSU was followed by the second generation of the microwave sounder, the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-A (AMSU-A), starting from 1998 until the present. The AMSU-A contains more channels, with their measurement extended from the surface to the upper stratosphere with higher spatial resolutions both horizontally and vertically than its predecessor, the MSU. However, channel frequencies in their counterpart channels are slightly different (
