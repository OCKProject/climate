<p class="p">The Aqua and MetOp-A AMSU-A daily data contain files with ascending and descending orbits separately. We further averaged these daily data to derive ascending and descending monthly data with the same spatial resolution. We then calculated a multiyear average for each channel, which is referred to as the annual mean “climatology” throughout this study, for ascending and descending orbits separately and for their averages, by averaging data for the same month at each grid cell through the period from January 2012 to December 2016 (figs. S2 and S3). The period for this climatology is exactly the same as for the ATMS. This is important, as selection of different periods for climatology calculation will introduce signals not suitable for an apple-to-apple comparison of the anomaly time series. Temperature anomalies for ascending and descending orbits and for their averages were calculated for each grid cells based on their climatology. Global mean anomalies were an area-weighted average of the anomalies over the globe for ascending and descending orbits and their averages, respectively.</p>
