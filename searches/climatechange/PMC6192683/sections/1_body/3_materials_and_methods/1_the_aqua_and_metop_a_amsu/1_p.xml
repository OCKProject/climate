<p class="p">The AMSU-A was designed to measure the vertical temperature profile from the Earth’s surface to the upper stratosphere with its 15 channels ranging from 23.8 to 89 GHz (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The AMSU-A is a total power, line-scanning radiometer with an instantaneous field of view (FOV) of 3.3° at the half-power points. Its antenna provides a cross-track scan, covering 48.33° on each side of the nadir direction with a total of 30 Earth FOVs per scan line. These scan patterns and geometric resolution translate to a 45-km-diameter cell at nadir and a 2343-km swath width on the ground from the 833-km nominal orbital altitude.
