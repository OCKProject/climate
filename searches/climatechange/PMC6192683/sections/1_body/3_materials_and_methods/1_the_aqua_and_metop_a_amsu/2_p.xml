<p class="p">We used the Aqua and MetOp-A AMSU-A daily gridded brightness temperature data archived at the NOAA/National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) in the Climate Data Record Program (

The dataset was originally produced by the NOAA/Center for Satellite Applications and Research (STAR) group as an AMSU-A fundamental climate data record (

 </xref>). In this dataset, intersatellite biases were minimized for the AMSU-A observations onboard multiple polar-orbiting satellites, including NOAA-15 to NOAA-18, Aqua, and MetOp-A. For Aqua, only a constant offset was added to its original swath radiances for each individual channel to minimize its differences from AMSU-A observations from other satellites (

 </xref>). In this sense, this version of the Aqua data preserved the characteristics in the original operational calibration in terms of calibration drift, that is, no additional calibration drift was introduced to the Aqua data by the intercalibration effort. For MetOp-A AMSU-A, constant offsets and optimal nonlinear calibration coefficients were applied to minimize its differences from other satellites. Different calibration nonlinearity affects the seasonal cycles observed by the AMSU-A channels (
