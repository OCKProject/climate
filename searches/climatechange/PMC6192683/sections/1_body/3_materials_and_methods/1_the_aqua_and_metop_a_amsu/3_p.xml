<p class="p">In addition to swath radiances at each scan angles, the NOAA/STAR AMSU-A fundamental climate data record contains limb-corrected brightness temperatures for Aqua, MetOp-A, and other satellites. A limb correction adjusts radiances at off-nadir view angles to those at the nadir direction. This adjustment allows the use of the off-nadir footprints in the same way as the nadir observations to increase observational samples and reduce noise and sampling-related biases in developing climate data record. The statistical algorithm developed by Goldberg

The NOAA/STAR AMSU-A daily gridded data were generated by accumulating and binning limb-adjusted AMSU-A brightness temperatures into grid cells with a resolution of 1° latitude by 1° longitude and then averaging them in daily intervals (
