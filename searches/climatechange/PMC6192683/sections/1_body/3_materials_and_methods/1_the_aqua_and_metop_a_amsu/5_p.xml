<p class="p">The archiving in NOAA/NCEI contains AMSU-A data from channels 4 to 14. Aqua AMSU-A channels 4 and 5 failed since September 2007 and April 2012, respectively. The failure in channel 5 affected the quality of limb adjustment for its adjacent channel 6. Therefore, we only compared Aqua/AMSU-A channels 7 through 14 to the ATMS data. Similarly, MetOp-A AMSU-A channels 7 and 8 failed since December 2009 and April 2016, respectively. The failure of these two channels caused quality issues for limb adjustments for their adjacent channels 6 and 9. As a result, we only compared MetOp-A/AMSU-A channels 4, 5, and 10 through 14 to the ATMS data.</p>
