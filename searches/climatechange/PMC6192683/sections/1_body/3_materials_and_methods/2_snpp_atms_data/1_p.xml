<p class="p">The ATMS is a total power cross-track radiometer with 22 channels, providing sounding observations of the atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles. The ATMS temperature-sounding channels have exactly the same channel frequencies as AMSU-A for most channels except for an addition of channel 4 (51.74 GHz,

ATMS scans Earth within the range of 52.725° on each side of the nadir direction with an angular sampling interval of 1.11°, providing 96 Earth observations in a scan line. The ATMS antenna beam width is 2.2° for temperature-sounding channels 3 to 16. The differences in the beam width between ATMS and AMSU-A result in differences in the size of their FOVs. Because the angular sampling interval is much smaller than the beam width, the ATMS scans result in oversampling in both cross-track and along-track directions. A single FOV of any of ATMS channels 3 to 16 typically overlaps with its three neighboring FOVs and three nearby scan lines (
