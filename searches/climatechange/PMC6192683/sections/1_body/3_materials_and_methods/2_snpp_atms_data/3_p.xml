<p class="p">We calculated ATMS monthly anomaly time series similar to AMSU-A for their comparisons and stability assessments. For this purpose, we first generated daily gridded data, for ascending and descending orbits separately, by accumulating and binning limb-adjusted ATMS brightness temperatures into grid cells with a resolution of 1° latitude by 1° longitude and then averaging them in daily intervals. Each ATMS scan has 96 footprints; however, we only used near-nadir footprints from scan positions 29 to 68 to match with the swath width of AMSU-A. To compare with AMSU-A data of the same quantity, we further averaged these daily data in monthly intervals to derive monthly ascending and descending data with the same grid resolution. We calculated temperature anomalies for ascending and descending orbits and for their averages for each grid cells based on their annual mean climatology from January 2012 to December 2016. In figs. S2 and S3, we show comparisons of the ascending and descending climatology to those from Aqua AMSU-A. Similar to AMSU-A, global mean anomalies were an area-weighted average over the anomalies on all grid cells for a specific month.</p>
