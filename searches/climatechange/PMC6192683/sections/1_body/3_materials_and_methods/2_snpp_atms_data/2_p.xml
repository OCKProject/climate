<p class="p">We used the SNPP/ATMS temperature data record (TDR) reprocessed by the NOAA/STAR ATMS calibration and reprocessing teams to generate the ATMS anomaly time series. The reprocessed TDR data were generated on the basis of a consistent calibration algorithm as described by Weng

 </xref>). The reprocessing had eliminated radiance discontinuity on March 2017 caused by changes in calibration algorithms during operational processing. The reprocessed TDR contains ATMS brightness temperatures at each scan position. Before using them for stability assessment, we further performed limb adjustments to the ATMS radiance data using limb correction coefficients developed by Zhang
