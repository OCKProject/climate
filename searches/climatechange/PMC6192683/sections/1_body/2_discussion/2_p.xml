<p class="p">Similarly, the GPS radio occultation (RO) observations had been used for temperature trend investigation over the stratosphere, and they were found in agreement with the Aqua/AMSU-A observations within 0.04 K per decade (

In contrast, homogenized satellite data products of earlier versions developed by different research groups showed climate trend differences up to 0.2 K per decade relative to the GPS-RO observations for the lower-stratospheric layer (

In this aspect, the stable SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/MetOp-A observations could help in identifying potential drifts in the homogenized satellite temperature records and improve their accuracy by serving as a reference in developing algorithms for corrections of diurnal sampling and calibration-drifting errors. In the latest development of homogenized satellite temperature records, researchers had used Aqua and MetOp-A as references to correct diurnal sampling drifting errors (
