<p class="p">In conclusion, the next-generation U.S. microwave sounder, the SNPP/ATMS, because of its high accuracy and stable orbit, has brought a highly needed capability in terms of reliably measuring the global and regional climate temperature trends. Such a capability is a critical milestone in resolving debates on uncertainties in the climateâ€™s atmospheric temperature trends. The SNPP and NOAA-20 satellites will be followed by three NOAA operational JPSS satellites providing accurate and stable measurement for decades to come. The primary mission of JPSS is for weather forecasting. Now with the added feature of stable orbits, JPSS observations can also be used to monitor changes in climate with much lower uncertainty than the previous generation of NOAA operational satellites. This will benefit the entire climate science and service community for climate change investigation and support of decision-making process on climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p>
