<p class="p">Asymmetric trends of diurnal temperatures in the lower and middle troposphere found in the SNPP and MetOp-A observations could bring complications to the selection of the reference satellites for diurnal drift correction and affect the long-term trends in homogenized temperature time series. In developing satellite data records, researchers adjusted satellite observations at different times to either local midnight (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">13</italic>
 </xref>) or local noon (
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>), in which satellites with stable orbits but different overpass times were combined together to serve as references. Over the global land, however, the midnight warms faster than the noon by about 0.072 K per decade and 0.031 K per decade in the lower- and mid-tropospheric temperatures, respectively. In extreme cases, the evening (21:30 p.m.) warms faster than the morning (9:30 a.m.) by as large as 0.111 K per decade for the lower-tropospheric temperatures over land. For an accurate estimation and fair comparison of long-term trends, different satellite data records should be adjusted to the same local time with asymmetric trends of diurnal temperatures accounted for when conducting diurnal drift corrections. These adjustments require knowledge of the relative trends between different reference satellites. The approach applied in this study for assessing asymmetric trends of diurnal temperatures would help improve the consistency of climate data records for temperature trend detection with improved accuracy.
