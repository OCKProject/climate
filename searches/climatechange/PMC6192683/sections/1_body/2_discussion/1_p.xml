<p class="p">The high radiometric stability in the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A measurements, as well as the MetOp-A/AMSU-A stratospheric channels, has broad impact on the climate trend observations from the microwave sounders as well as other instruments and could help resolve debates on observed differences in the climate trends. Radiosonde observations had been homogenized and extensively used for detecting climate temperature trends from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere (

 </xref>). It remains a puzzle so far as to determine which of the two observations are more reliable when their derived trends in the atmospheric temperatures differ. By comparing with the stable observations from the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A, biases and their drifts over time in the radiosonde observations could be identified, which could, in turn, help in developing more accurate radiosonde data records for climate trend detection.
