<p class="p">The difference time series between the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A anomalies demonstrate favorable statistics on their radiometric stability. For most channels and both ascending and descending orbits, their anomaly differences during their overlaps from December 2011 to April 2018 are less than 0.02 K in all monthly averages with a mean of 0 K to two decimal places and an SD of only around 0.005 to 0.01 K (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S1). The 6-year trends for the anomaly difference time series are less than 0.04 K per decade for seven of eight channels for both ascending and descending orbits examined here. Trend differences between ascending and descending orbits in the anomaly difference time series are less than 0.01 K per decade for all channels. The high precision in the anomaly difference time series allows their trend estimates with much lower uncertainty, being around 0.02 K per decade for most channels, although the overlapping period is still short. These trend statistics suggest that there are little or nearly no relative drifting errors between the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A observations. Because the two instruments were calibrated completely independently and no time-dependent intersatellite bias correction was imposed, it is unlikely that their biases are drifting to exactly the same direction to arrive at a near-zero relative drifting error. The most probable explanation is that the anomaly time series from both observations closely represent the actual change of the atmosphere, that is, both instruments have achieved an absolute radiometric stability within 0.04 K per decade.
