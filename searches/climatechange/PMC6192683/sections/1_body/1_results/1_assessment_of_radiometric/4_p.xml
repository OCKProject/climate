<p class="p">Such a stability has an important implication for climate trend detection. It suggests that climate temperature trends can be detected with an uncertainty only of 0.04 K per decade from the troposphere to the stratosphere. Given the required instrument stabilities for detecting climate change, which are 0.04 K per decade for the troposphere and 0.08 K per decade for the stratosphere (

 </xref>), the uncertainties we obtained are sufficiently small, especially for the stratospheric channels, for accurate trend determination that could serve as a basic information in advancing climate change science such as understanding past climate changes and validation of climate model simulations to build confidence for climate change prediction in the future. Considering that the overlap between SNPP and Aqua is still short in our current comparison, we expect that the trends in their difference time series, and thus the observational uncertainty in the trend detection, will become yet smaller when both observations become longer.
