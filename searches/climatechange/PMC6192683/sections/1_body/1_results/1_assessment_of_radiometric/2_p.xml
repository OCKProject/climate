<p class="p">Because changes of calibration biases with season have been included in climatology, calibration-drifting error, if it exists, will be reflected in the anomaly time series as change of calibration biases from year to year. We define an observation as being absolutely stable or free of calibration-drifting error if calibration biases do not incur interannual change. For absolute stable observations, the anomaly time series shall represent the actual climate changes in the layer mean temperatures measured by the instrument channels. Calibration-drifting errors are unknown a priori in general, and they can only be identified when the anomaly time series are compared to a reference with known drifting errors. Unfortunately, such a reference does not usually exist. The fact that Aqua/AMSU-A and SNPP/ATMS have the same channel frequencies for most channels and stable orbits with close to the same local observation time provides a rare opportunity for examination of their relative drifting errors and mutual validation.</p>
