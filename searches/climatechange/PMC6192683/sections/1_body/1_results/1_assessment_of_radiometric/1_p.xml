 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> the anomaly time series of brightness temperatures averaged over the ascending and descending orbits for the example channels, SNPP/ATMS channel 9 versus its Aqua/AMSU-A counterpart channel 8, and their difference time series. We also show in fig. S1 (A and B) the global mean anomalies for all analyzed channels here for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. The temperature anomalies in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and fig. S1 are a quantity measuring layer mean temperature changes with respect to a climatology for each individual channel. The temperatures in the climatology are fixed values for each month and each grid cell (fig. S2). As a multiyear mean of the monthly brightness temperatures, the climatology is composed of two parts: the actual climatology representing the real atmosphere measured by the specific channel and calibration biases. The latter quantity may change slightly with season and geolocation, a consequence of scene temperature–dependent biases owing to inaccurate calibration nonlinearity (

 </xref>). These scene temperature–dependent biases are respectively demonstrated in figs. S2 and S3 in the climatology differences between SNPP and Aqua.
