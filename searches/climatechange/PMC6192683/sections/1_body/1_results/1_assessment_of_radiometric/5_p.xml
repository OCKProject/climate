<p class="p">The only exception is for AMSU-A channel 9 versus ATMS channel 10, which have a trend of 0.06 K per decade in their anomaly difference time series. There are two possible reasons for this larger drift. The first is inaccurate calibration nonlinearity in either of the ATMS or AMSU-A instruments. On the basis of analyses of calibration equation (12) and of simultaneous nadir overpasses for satellite pairs (9-10), inaccurate calibration nonlinearity causes observational biases to depend on scene temperatures in which biases are approximately linearly proportional to differences between the scene and reference temperatures. This is mathematically expressed as
