<p class="p">The effects from the above two sources of error appear to be small for most channels in the SNPP and Aqua comparisons, but non-negligible for the exceptional channels. Nevertheless, the exceptional channels measure temperatures in the lower stratosphere, and the magnitude of their relative drift is actually within the required instrument stability of 0.08 K per decade for the stratosphere. In this sense, this exception is not a big concern on the statement of the high radiometric stability performance in the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A observations. However, the potential impact on the accuracy of trend estimates from these sources of error needs to be carefully examined whenever two instruments are compared for assessment of radiometric stability and when observations from the SNPP/ATMS and Aqua/AMSU-A continue into the future.</p>
