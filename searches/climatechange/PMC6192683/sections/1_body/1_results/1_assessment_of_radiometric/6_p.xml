<p class="p">The second reason is a possible shift in channel frequencies in the comparing instruments. Researchers found frequency shifts for certain AMSU-A channels in previous investigations (

 </xref>). Channel frequency shift causes an instrument channel to measure temperatures at atmospheric layers differently from its original design. Frequency mismatch between two instrument channels could result in a nonzero trend in their anomaly difference time series being equal to the trend differences between the two layers of the real atmosphere observed by the two channels.
