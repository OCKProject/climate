<p class="p">As an index for diurnal temperature differences, the diurnal temperature range, defined as the differences between the daily maximum and minimum temperatures, was found decreasing at a rate of 0.066 K per decade during 1950â€“2004 over the global land surface (

 </xref>). We expect similar cooling trends in diurnal temperature range for satellite temperature of the lower troposphere because it is close to the surface. The cooling trends of the satellite daytime relative to nighttime observations found here for the lower-tropospheric temperatures over the global land resemble the cooling trends in the diurnal temperature range at the surface, although they were estimated for different periods of time from different local observation times.
