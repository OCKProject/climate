<p class="p">For the stratospheric channels, that is, SNPP/ATMS channels 11 to 15 and MetOp-A/AMSU-A channels 10 to 14 where surface contribution is absent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), asymmetric diurnal temperature trends appeared to be negligible (figs. S4 and S5). Consequently, similar to SNPP and Aqua, the small trends in the anomaly differences between SNPP and MetOp-A for both ascending and descending orbits suggest that both instruments have achieved an absolute radiometric stability within 0.04 K per decade for these stratospheric channels (fig. S4). However, due to the lower precision in the differences between SNPP/ATMS channel 15 and MetOp-A/AMSU-A channel 14, the uncertainty associated with the trend calculation is as high as Â±0.07 K per decade for the anomaly differences over the ocean. This resulted in lower reliability on the stability assessment for MetOp-A/AMSU-A channel 14.
