<p class="p">Focusing on SNPP/ATMS channel 5 and MetOp-A/AMSU-A channel 4, trends in their anomaly differences show large disagreement between the ascending and descending orbits, being 0.025 K per decade for the former and 0.097 K per decade for the latter, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). This yields a difference as large as 0.072 K per decade between them. This is in contrast to the comparisons between the SNPP and Aqua where trends in their anomaly differences are about the same for ascending and descending orbits for all channels (fig. S1). Because the instrument calibration equation is the same for ascending and descending orbits (9-10), we expect instrument-specific errors, such as instrument calibration drifts, if they exist, to be the same for ascending and descending orbits and thus they cancel out in the differentiations between the two nodes. This is supported by the comparisons between SNPP and Aqua, in which the trend differences between the ascending and descending orbits in their anomaly difference time series are less than 0.01 K per decade for all channels (fig. S1). This argument rules out the calibration drifts and other instrument-specific errors as potential causes for the large trend difference of 0.072 K per decade between the ascending and descending orbits for SNPP and MetOp-A. As a result, the only reason left to explain their dissimilarity in ascending and descending orbits would be their differences in observation time.
