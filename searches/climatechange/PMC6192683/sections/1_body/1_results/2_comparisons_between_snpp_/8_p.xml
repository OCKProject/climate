<p class="p">Although radiometric stability cannot be determined for MetOp-A/AMSU-A channels 4 and 5 and SNPP/ATMS channels 5 and 6, orbital differences between them allow reliable estimates of relative trends between the daytime and nighttime temperatures for the lower and middle troposphere. This unique measurement capability would benefit the investigation and understanding of the long-term trends in diurnal temperature range and their relationship to changes in cloud, precipitation, aerosol, soil moisture, temperature extremes, and other atmospheric and surface variables (
