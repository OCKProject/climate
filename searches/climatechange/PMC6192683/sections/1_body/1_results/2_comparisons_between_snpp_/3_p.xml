<p class="p">Looking at the SNPP and MetOp-A trends during 2012â€“2018 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> for ascending and descending nodes separately and taking their LECT information into consideration, the MetOp-A nighttime trend at 21:30 a.m. local time from the ascending orbits (0.588 K per decade) was warmer than its daytime trend at 9:30 p.m. local time from the descending orbits (0.543 K per decade) by 0.045 K per decade. Meanwhile, the SNPP nighttime trend at 1:30 a.m. from the descending orbits (0.640 K per decade) was warmer than its daytime trend at 13:30 p.m. from the ascending orbits (0.613 K per decade) by 0.027 K per decade. Note that trend values for a specific ascending or descending node could contain an unknown calibration-drifting error (up to 0.04 K per decade based on the analyses on SNPP and Aqua), but this error mostly cancels out by differentiations between the ascending and descending orbits for the same satellite. Consequently, the trend differences between the daytime and nighttime temperatures are fairly reliable.
