<p class="p">AMSU-A channel 5 and ATMS channel 6 measure temperatures in the mid-troposphere, which receive a smaller portion of radiative contribution from the surface than AMSU-A channel 4 and ATMS channel 5. As a result, they exhibited similar asymmetric diurnal trends but with smaller magnitudes. Specifically, the MetOp-A daytime temperatures at 9:30 a.m. minus the nighttime temperatures at 21:30 p.m. cooled at a rate of 0.048 K per decade over the global land and 0.010 K per decade over the global ocean, respectively. The SNPP daytime temperature at 13:30 p.m. minus the nighttime temperature at 1:30 a.m. had a cooling trend of 0.015 K per decade over the global land and 0.024 K per decade over the global ocean, respectively. In average, the local noon minus local midnight had an estimated cooling trend of about 0.031 K per decade over the global land and 0.017 K per decade over the global ocean, respectively, for the mid-tropospheric temperatures during 2012â€“2018.</p>
