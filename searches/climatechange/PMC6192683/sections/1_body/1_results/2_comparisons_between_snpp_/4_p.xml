<p class="p">In summary of the above analyses, the two daytime observations minus the two nighttime observations from the SNPP and MetOp-A satellites had been cooling at a rate of 0.072 K per decade (=0.045 K per decade + 0.027 K per decade) during 2012–2018. This equals exactly the trend differences between the descending and ascending orbits in the SNPP and MetOp-A anomaly difference time series (=0.097 K per decade − 0.025 K per decade). Note that averages of the two daytimes are close to the local noon, while averages of the two nighttimes are close to the local midnight. This gives an estimated cooling trend of about 0.036 K per decade for the global lower-tropospheric temperature differences of the local noon and local midnight (the former minus the latter), which is one-half of those between the two daytime and two nighttime observations. Such asymmetric trends in the daytime and nighttime temperatures behave differently over the land and ocean. Over the global land, the MetOp-A daytime temperatures at 9:30 a.m. minus its nighttime temperatures at 21:30 p.m. cooled at a rate as large as 0.111 K per decade; over the global ocean, however, this relative cooling was only 0.018 K per decade. Meanwhile, the SNPP daytime temperatures at 13:30 p.m. minus its nighttime temperatures at 1:30 a.m. cooled at a rate of 0.033 K per decade over land and 0.024 K per decade over ocean, respectively. By averaging the SNPP and MetOp-A observations, the estimated cooling trend of the local noon relative to local midnight was about 0.072 K per decade over the global land (which happened to be twice as large as the global means) and 0.021 K per decade over the global ocean.</p>
