<p class="p">It is of interest to understand whether the stability assessment approach above can be applied to satellites with stable orbits but different overpass times such as those between SNPP and MetOp-A. We show in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> the temperature anomaly time series for SNPP/ATMS channel 5 and its MetOp-A/AMSU-A counterpart channel 4 as well as their differences for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. These channels measure temperatures of the lower troposphere with a weighting function peaking near 0.5 km (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Figures S4 and S5 show similar comparisons for all analyzed channels for global ocean and global land means, respectively. Similar to the comparisons between SNPP and Aqua, the anomaly differences between SNPP and MetOp-A have means of 0 K to two decimal places for both ascending and descending orbits. However, the SDs for these differences are much larger, ranging from 0.015 K for the tropospheric channels to 0.04 K for the upper stratospheric channels over the global ocean (fig. S4).
