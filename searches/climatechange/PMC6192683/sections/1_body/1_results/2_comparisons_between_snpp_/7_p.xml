<p class="p">The existence of asymmetric diurnal temperature trends makes it complicated to use satellite difference time series to assess radiometric stabilities for the surface-affected channels when satellite orbits are separated by a few hours, although they are stable. There is an ambiguity to explain their differences. Large trends in their anomaly differences, as in the case between SNPP and MetOp-A for the descending orbits, do not necessarily suggest large instrument calibration drifts because they could be caused by asymmetry in diurnal temperature trends in the real atmosphere. On the other hand, small trends in the anomaly differences, as in the case between the SNPP and MetOp-A for ascending orbits, do not necessarily suggest small calibration drifts because they could be a cancellation result between large calibration drifts and trends in diurnal temperature differences. Hence, more sophisticated approaches may need to be developed for accurate assessment of instrument stabilities for the surface-affected channels for satellites with different orbits. Nevertheless, satellites in the MetOp series all have the same orbits. The MetOp-A/AMSU-A radiometric stability could be assessed by comparisons with MetOp-B/AMSU-A, which has overlaps since September 2012, using the same approach as for the SNPP and Aqua.</p>
