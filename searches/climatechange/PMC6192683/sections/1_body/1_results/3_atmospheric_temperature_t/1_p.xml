<p class="p">The high radiometric stability performance in Aqua/AMSU-A during its overlaps with SNPP/ATMS can be extended to its earlier observations because the calibration algorithm has been maintained the same throughout the Aqua/AMSU-A operations (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> the 16-year trends for Aqua/AMSU-A channels 7 to 14 during 2002–2018, representing temperatures from the upper troposphere to the upper stratosphere. Although observational uncertainties are small, uncertainties associated with time length and temporal variability are still non-negligible, and they are shown as uncertainty bars superimposed on the trend values. These uncertainties will become smaller as observations become longer. This figure provides a vertical structure of the global temperature trends with high resolution and negligible observational uncertainty. Temperature trends in the upper troposphere were 0.12 ± 0.16 K per decade, gradually decreasing to near zero in the lower stratosphere and cooling with a magnitude of 0.49 ± 0.19 K per decade in the upper stratosphere. This structure is consistent with the recent examinations of atmospheric temperature trends with longer period of satellite observations and climate model simulations (
