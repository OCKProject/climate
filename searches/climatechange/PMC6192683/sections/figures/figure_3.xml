  <title class="title">Anomaly time series for assessment of radiometric stability.</title>
  <p class="p">Monthly global mean anomaly time series of brightness temperatures for AMSU-A channel 8 onboard Aqua (blue, top) versus ATMS channel 9 onboard SNPP (red, top) and their difference time series (green, top and bottom). The AMSU-A and ATMS data are from June 2002 and December 2011 to April 2018, respectively. The AMSU-A anomaly time series are overlaid by ATMS during their overlapping period, with their differences shown as nearly a constant zero line in the same temperature scale. Amplified scale of temperature is used in the bottom panel to show detailed features in the anomaly difference time series. Both ATMS and AMSU-A data are from limb-adjusted views and averaged over ascending and descending orbits. Uncertainties in trends represent 95% confidence intervals with autocorrelation adjustments.</p>
