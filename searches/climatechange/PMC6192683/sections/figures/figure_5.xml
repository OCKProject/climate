  <p class="p">Temperature trends during 2002–2018 estimated from Aqua/AMSU-A channels 7 to 14 for averages of ascending and descending orbits, representing temperatures from the upper troposphere to the upper stratosphere. Uncertainties due to time length limitation and temporal variability (not the observational uncertainty due to instability) at 95% confidence intervals with autocorrelation adjustments are superimposed on the trend bars.</p>
