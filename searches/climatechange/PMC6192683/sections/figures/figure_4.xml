  <title class="title">Anomaly time series for assessment of asymmetric diurnal temperature trends.</title>
  <p class="p">Monthly global mean anomaly time series of brightness temperatures for AMSU-A channel 4 onboard MetOp-A (blue, left) versus ATMS channel 5 onboard SNPP (red, left) and their difference time series (right). The top and bottom panels are for ascending and descending orbits, respectively. Both ATMS and AMSU-A data are from limb-adjusted views. Uncertainties in trends represent 95% confidence intervals with autocorrelation adjustments.</p>
