<p class="p">The biggest consistent difference in terms of area predicted suitable for large fires was that the three scenarios that accounted for dynamic wildfire resulted in lower area suitable than all other scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). When dynamically modeled vegetation was included without fire or land use change (ModDyn), the predicted suitable area for large fires was the largest among scenarios in all time periods and both climate scenarios, except for end-century (2070) MIROC, where it was second highest. The other two no-fire scenarios using input from the DGVM (ModStat and ModDynLU) also had relatively higher predicted suitable area for large fires than the scenarios without vegetation (NoVeg) or with the static map of existing vegetation (MapStat), except in MIROC mid- and end-century, where MapStat scenario resulted in equal or higher suitable area. As with all fires, the mean probability of fires across the landscape was similar in rank order of.
