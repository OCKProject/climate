<p class="p">For the CNRM climate scenario, the projected suitable large fire area increased over time for all vegetation scenarios, mostly in proportion to the total predicted suitable area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). There was a larger increase in suitable area projected by mid-century (2040), which slightly diminished by end-century (2070). When projected using the MIROC climate scenario, there were different trends in projections depending upon the vegetation scenario, which did not necessarily follow the rank order of total area predicted suitable. In particular, despite the fact that the dynamic fire scenarios consistently had less total area predicted suitable for large fires, the projected decline over time was lower for these scenarios than all but the MapStat scenario (the only projected to increase) by mid-century. Yet, by end-century, the dynamic fire scenarios (and MapStat) were projected to experience an increased trend of suitable fire area, which was opposite to those without fire.
