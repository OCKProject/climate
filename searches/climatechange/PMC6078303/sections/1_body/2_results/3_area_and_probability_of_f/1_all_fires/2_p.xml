<p class="p">While the projection of larger overall area in the NoVeg and MapStat scenarios was consistent across time periods and climate scenarios, there were also clear differences in overall projected change in fire activity depending on climate scenario. The predicted suitable area for all fires was slightly higher in CNRM than MIROC for baseline and mid-century projections, but the area projected suitable under MIROC for end-century was substantially lower than for CNRM, to the point that there was a projected decline in fire for all scenarios (Figs

The mean landscape-scale probability of large fires was projected to follow a similar trend under the climate scenarios, such that the end-century (2070) MIROC projections not only resulted in lower total suitable area predicted, but the probability of fire in that area was also lower (
