<p class="p">For the all fires projections, there was a clear separation of the NoVeg and MapStat scenarios from the scenarios that incorporated modeled vegetation as input variables. Specifically, there was larger overall predicted area suitable for NoVeg and MapStat for both climate scenarios than there was for scenarios with modeled vegetation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). This difference among scenarios was so large that by end-century (2070), there was a projected increase in suitable fire area for NoVeg and MapStat under the CNRM scenario, but the opposite was true using modeled vegetation variables, where fire area was projected to decline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). Opposite trends in direction of change were also apparent by the mid-century (2040) for the MIROC scenario. Differences among the modeled vegetation scenarios were subtle, although the scenarios where land use was explicitly modeled resulted in slightly lower predicted area suitable (i.e., in ModDyn vs ModDynLU and in ModDynFS vs ModDynFSLU) (
