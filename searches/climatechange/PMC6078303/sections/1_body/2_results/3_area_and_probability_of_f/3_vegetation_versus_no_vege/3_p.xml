<p class="p">Cumulatively, across time periods, climate future, and vegetation scenario combinations, needleleaf and mixed forest vegetation types were more strongly associated with higher fire probability than lower versus NoVeg, with aggregate mean probability changes of 0.005 and 0.014 respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g011" class="xref">Fig 11</xref>). Under several of the combinations, however, each yielded a lower fire probability versus NoVeg. Grass yielded a lower aggregate probability versus NoVeg, -0.009, but yielded a higher probability in 11 of 18 combinations. Shrub and nonflammable yielded the largest lower probabilities versus NoVeg, -0.024 and -0.029 respectively. Each of these was lower than NoVeg in all combinations.
