<p class="p">The three baseline scenarios for all fires were similar (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>). In all three, distance to roads was the most important explanatory variable, with fires more likely to occur in close proximity to roads. The next two top-ranking variables were proximity to development, a negative relationship, and temperature seasonality, with fires more likely to occur with intermediate variation in seasonal temperature. Cooler summer temperatures and lower-percentage slopes were also moderately important. In the two baseline scenarios that included vegetation (MapStat with LANDFIRE and ModStat with modeled vegetation), the vegetation variables were among the lowest-ranking in importance of explanatory variables. The mean cross-validated AUC for all three baseline scenarios was 0.64.
