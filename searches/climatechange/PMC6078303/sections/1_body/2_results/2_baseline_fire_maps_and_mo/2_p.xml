<p class="p">The baseline scenario variable importance for large fires was similar across non-vegetation explanatory variables, although the most important variables for large fires were dissimilar to the ones important for all fires (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>). The most important non-vegetation variables for large fires included low-moderate summer precipitation, steep slopes, intermediate distance to development, and moderate-to-high climatic water deficit. Temperature variables were much less important than precipitation variables. For the baseline scenarios with vegetation included as explanatory variables, vegetation was either the most important (MapStat) or second-most important (ModStat) variable in the model. If the three vegetation variables are summed in ModStat, then vegetation was the most important variable for that scenario as well. The mean cross-validated AUC for the large fire baselines was 0.75 for NoVeg, 0.79 for MapStat, and 0.76 for ModStat.
