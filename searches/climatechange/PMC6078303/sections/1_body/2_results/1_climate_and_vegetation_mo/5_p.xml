<p class="p">Carbon in above ground dead wood (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) was much higher in without-fire scenarios than with-fire and was generally higher under CNRM than MIROC. Also, it was much higher at higher elevations. Values for live woody carbon (leaves, boles, branches, and roots) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) followed similar patterns as those for aboveground dead wood.
