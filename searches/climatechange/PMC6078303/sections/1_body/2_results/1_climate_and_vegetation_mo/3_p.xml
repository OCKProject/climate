<p class="p">For scenarios with vegetation change, there were large differences between those with fire and those without, with substantial differences already apparent by 2010, after running the simulations with different treatments from 1895 (

For example, under the with-fire scenarios (ModDynFSLU and ModDynFire), the study region was dominated by shrubland to the near exclusion of all other classes, except nonflammable for ModDynFSLU. Under the no-fire scenarios (ModDyneNFLU and ModDynNF), the region was dominated by a combination of needleleaf and mixed and broadleaf forests. Generally, CNRM projected more mixed and broadleaf forest than MIROC, which had greater needleaf forest in the no-fire scenarios and greater shrub in the with-fire scenarios.
