 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201680.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). MIROC, on the other hand, projected slightly higher annual precipitation initially followed by lower precipitation, with a decrease of 17% by the end of the century, although summer precipitation was projected to increase. These patterns were generally consistent across elevations. Minimum temperatures were projected to rise by several degrees for both scenarios over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> c. for all elevations, with end of century CNRM rises being 0.4, 0.16, and 0.76 greater than MIROCâ€™s for the full study area, elevations less than or equal to 1000 m, and elevations greater than 1000 m, respectively. Climatic water deficit (CWD) was also projected to increase by the end of the century for both scenarios and across elevations, with CNRM rising less compared to MIROC (11% and 24% for CNRM and MIROC, respectively, over the whole area). CWD initially declined for CNRM at all elevations before increasing.
