<p class="p">After reclassification of broad vegetation types, there was 73% agreement between MC2 baseline and LANDFIRE vegetation maps. Compared with LANDFIRE, MC2 vegetation had more shrubland in the Central Valley and Cascade foothills, with less nonflammable area in the Central Valley and less mixed and broadleaf cover at lower elevation. MC2 baseline had more mixed and broadleaf ranging higher into the Cascade foothills where needleaf dominated under LANDFIRE. Shrubs were more present in the northwestern portion of the study region under MC2 versus LANDFIRE. MC2 delineated grasslands only in areas recovering from simulated timber harvest while LANDFIRE mapped grassland along the edges of the Central Valley.</p>
