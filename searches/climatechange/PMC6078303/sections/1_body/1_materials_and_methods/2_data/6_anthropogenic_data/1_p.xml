<p class="p">Given that human infrastructure, including development and roads, are spatially associated with ignition and fuel continuity patterns [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], we used two anthropogenic explanatory variables in all scenarios: Euclidean distance to roads and dynamic distance to urban development. To develop the distance to urban development data, we extracted the “development” land use type from the Sleeter land use projections and calculated Euclidean surfaces to this binary land use type. We used 2010 development data for baseline models and the 2010–2039 period, 2040 development data for the 2040–2069 period, and 2070 development data for 2070–2099 period.
