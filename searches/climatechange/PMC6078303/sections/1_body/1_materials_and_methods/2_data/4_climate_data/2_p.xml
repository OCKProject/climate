<p class="p">The climate data were available as annual historical and projected surface grids developed by the California Basin Characterization Model (CA-BCM 2014) at a 270-m resolution (

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] were downscaled from 800-m resolution using Gradient-Inverse-Distance-Squared (GIDS) downscaling [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. We processed these annual data to create 30-year baseline statistical summaries from 1980–2010. We compared future climate projections using climate surfaces from two CMIP-5 General Circulation Models that have been recommended as priorities for research due to their relevance to California and their range of possible futures [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. These included CNRM-CM5 (“cool/wet”) and MIROC5 (complement/cover range of outputs). For both scenarios, we used the RCP 8.5 “business as usual” emissions scenario. We processed the data for projections at three time steps (2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099, hereafter 2010, 2040, and 2070, respectively).
