<p class="p">Fire is simulated as a discrete event with impacts including mortality and aboveground biomass consumption. A wildfire is triggered when a cell’s fuel condition exceeds its vegetation type’s fuel threshold. Ignitions are assumed and a cell is limited to one fire per year. Fire suppression effectively sets a vegetation type’s fuel condition threshold higher under the assumption that fires occurring under less severe fuel conditions can be extinguished. The fraction of a cell burned is limited to the years since last fire divided by its vegetation type’s fire return interval.</p>
