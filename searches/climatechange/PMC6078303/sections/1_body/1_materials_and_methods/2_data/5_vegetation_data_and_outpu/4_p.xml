We aggregated Sleeter’s development and transportation development classes into a single developed class and aggregated all classes unaffected by human activity into natural. This produced five land use classes for the model: developed, mining, annual agriculture, perennial agriculture, and natural. Within MC2, when land is converted from natural to one of the other classes, all above- and belowground vegetation components are removed. No vegetation grows in developed and mining cells. Annual crops grow as grasses and harvest removes all aboveground live carbon, 90% of aboveground dead carbon, 50% of belowground dead carbon. 95% of belowground living carbon is killed. Perennial crops grow as wild, with no harvest their first five years, removal of 90% dead carbon and 50% of live growing season production during years 5–40, and complete removal and restart after year 40. Fire is excluded from croplands.
