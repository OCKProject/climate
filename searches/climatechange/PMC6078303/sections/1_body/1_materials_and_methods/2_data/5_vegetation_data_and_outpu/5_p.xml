<p class="p">MC2 is run in four separate phases: 
 <italic class="italic">equilibrium</italic> to attain stable carbon pools and vegetation cover; 
 <italic class="italic">spinup</italic> to readjust carbon pools and vegetation types in response to dynamic fire; 
 <italic class="italic">historical transient</italic>, driven by observation based climate data; and 
 <italic class="italic">future transient</italic>, driven by projected future climate data. For this study, we ran MC2 across the entire state of California at a 30 arc second (approximately 800 m) resolution using observation-based historical climate data from 1895 to 2010, and and future climate projections from 2011 to 2099. Results were clipped the output to the extent of our study area. Outputs were resampled to match the climate data grid. To account for a range of potential fire and land use effects on vegetation and biomass, we ran the model under combinations of three different fire scenarios (no fire, fire suppression, and full fire) and with and without land use change incorporated into the simulations (
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The fire and land use scenarios were applied over the entire duration of the MC2 simulations, from 1895 through 2100. Thus, vegetation change could be observable before the simulation of future climate and land use projections.
