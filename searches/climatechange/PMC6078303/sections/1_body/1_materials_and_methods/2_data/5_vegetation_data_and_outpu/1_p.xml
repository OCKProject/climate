<p class="p">To generate dynamic projections of vegetation to use as input to the statistical model, we ran the MC2 dynamic global vegetation model (DGVM) to create decadal mapped outputs of vegetation type and biomass. MC2 [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] is a process-based model used at global to regional scales to simulate potential vegetation, carbon fluxes and pools, and wildfire. MC2 runs on a monthly timestep over a spatial grid, with each grid cell simulated independently.
