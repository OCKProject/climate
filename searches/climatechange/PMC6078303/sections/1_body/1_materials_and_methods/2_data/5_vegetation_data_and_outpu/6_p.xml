<p class="p">Our objective was to compare results among scenarios with three different assumptions regarding vegetation: no explicit vegetation (NoVeg), static vegetation (MapStat and ModStat (MC2)), and simulated dynamic vegetation (ModDyn (MC2); 
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We first evaluated a map of existing vegetation type (LANDFIRE [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]), (MapStat, 
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), then cross-walked reclassified vegetation types from that map to classes produced as output from MC2 to attain the best comparability in simulated current conditions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201680.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). To attain maximum map agreement and simplicity for the statistical modeling, we consolidated vegetation types into four broad vegetation types: grassland, shrubland, mixed and broadleaf forest, and needleleaf forest. We merged and labeled the rest of the classes as nonflammable, including development, agriculture, water, and barren land.
