<p class="p">Three modules simulate biogeochemistry, biogeography, and wildfire. The biogeochemistry module simulates water, carbon, and nutrient flows between pools based on climate, soil, and starting state. The biogeography component of the model determines the potential life forms and dynamic vegetation types on the landscape, which are defined based on a set of climate and biomass threshold rules. In the model simulations, vegetation types (not species) shift in response to climate change and atmospheric CO

The model generates output for various live and dead carbon pools, carbon fluxes, fuel characteristics, hydrologic fluxes, and vegetation characteristics.
