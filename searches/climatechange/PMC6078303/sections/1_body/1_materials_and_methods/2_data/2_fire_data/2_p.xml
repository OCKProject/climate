<p class="p">For the dataset of large fires, we used the State of California Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP) fire history database that provides spatially explicit wildfire perimeter data for all moderate-large fires reported by state and federal agencies. Again using data from 2000–2010 and overlaying the perimeters with the study area, we generated a random sample of points within perimeters of fires &gt; = 40 ha according to the method developed by Davis et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. That is, within each wildfire, we generated the number of points per fire proportional to the square root of the ratio between perimeter area and area of smallest fire, which resulted in a sample size of 346. We also forced a minimum distance of 270m between the random points generated so there would be no ‘duplicate’ points within a single grid cell.
