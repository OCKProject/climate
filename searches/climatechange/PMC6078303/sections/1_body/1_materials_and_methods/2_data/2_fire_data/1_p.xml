 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We compiled the first dataset, hereafter “all fires,” from the National Interagency Fire Program Analysis, Fire-Occurrence Database (FPA FOD) [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], which includes the spatial coordinate information indicating the point of ignition for all fires across all land ownership types, with the date and size of fire included as attributes. We overlaid and selected all fires that occurred within the study area for the years 2000–2010, to ensure we developed models based on recent environmental controls. To minimize the potential influence of spatial autocorrelation, we compared four minimum nearest neighbor distance filter sizes for thinning the points (500m and 1, 2, and 5 km). The 500m performed slightly better than the others (best balanced sensitivity and area predicted suitable), reducing the sample size from 7238 to 2048.
