<p class="p">We modeled projections of future fire distributions using a range of topographic, climatic, anthropogenic, and vegetation explanatory variables (
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). After considering a larger range of potential variables than those listed below, we used ENMTools [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] to calculate Pearson correlation coefficient between predictors for each baseline model (described below). For predictors with values r &gt; = 0.8, we selected the variable with higher mean 5-fold cross validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), a threshold-independent assessment of model discriminatory ability [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] in a univariate model. While elevation did perform better than highly correlated climate variables for large fires, we opted to drop it to maximize sensitivity to climate projections. To match the resolution of the climate data, we resampled all of the gridded explanatory variables to 270m.
