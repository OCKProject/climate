<p class="p">We evaluated three topographic variables to account for the effect of terrain on soil moisture and development, energy balance, and in turn, fuel characteristics and flammability [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). To account for the role of terrain in moderating energy and moisture balance, and in distinguishing xeric from mesic exposures, we used an index of solar insolation [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] as well as ‘southwestness’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], which is a cosine transformation of aspect. We also included slope, as this variable is also important in moderating fire behavior and spread rates [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The slope and baseline elevation and aspect variables were acquired from LANDFIRE [
