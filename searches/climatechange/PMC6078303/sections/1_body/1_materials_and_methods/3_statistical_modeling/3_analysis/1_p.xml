<p class="p">To compare all scenarios, we first calculated the total predicted suitable area of all and large fires by applying a threshold to create binary maps. We used a threshold of maximum sensitivity plus specificity because it has been shown to optimize discrimination between presence and absence data [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. From the resulting binary maps for all scenarios and time steps, we then summed the total area predicted suitable. In addition to the area predicted suitable for fires, we calculated the mean probability of all or large fires for all scenarios by summing the total predicted probabilities across all grid cells then dividing by the number of cells in the map.
