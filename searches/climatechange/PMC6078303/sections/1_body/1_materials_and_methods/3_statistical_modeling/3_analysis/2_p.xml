<p class="p">To characterize the detailed effects of modeled vegetation and related processes on large fire probability, we compared NoVeg fire probabilities with those from three scenarios with vegetation (WithVeg) ModStatFireLU, ModDynFireLU, and ModDynLU for each of the three time periods and each climate future. Difference maps were produced by subtracting NoVeg probabilities from each of the WithVeg scenarios. Differences were tabulated for each combination of: vegetation type, time period, scenario, climate future. Aggregate distributions of probability differences were plotted by vegetation type for each climate future.</p>
