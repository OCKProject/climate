 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The model algorithm generates 10,000 randomly located background points and then iteratively evaluates contrasts between values of the environmental predictor variables at these background locations with values of the predictors at the locations of the dependent variable (in this case, all or large fires). The best approximation of the distribution is determined as the one with maximum entropy. The output is an exponential function that assigns a probability of occurrence to each site or cell of a map. MaxEnt is widely used in many fields, with thousands of applications published in scientific journals, including for mapping the distribution of all or large fires [
