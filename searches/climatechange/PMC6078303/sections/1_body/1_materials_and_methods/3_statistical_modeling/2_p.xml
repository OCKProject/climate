<p class="p">For all scenarios, we used MaxEnt version 3.3.3k with the default settings, except we excluded product and threshold features, did not use clamping, and used a regularization multiplier of 1.5 to minimize overfitting. We developed three different baseline models for both all fires and large fires to correspond with the three versions of vegetation used to establish historical conditions. These included a baseline with no vegetation, a baseline using the LANDFIRE existing vegetation type map, and a baseline using the 2010 vegetation output of the MC2 model. We ran the baselines with 5 cross-validated replicates to get a mean 5-fold CV AUC and permutation importance values. For the future projections under different climate and vegetation scenarios, we projected the baseline models onto maps of future conditions for all time steps.</p>
