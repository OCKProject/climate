<p class="p">The study area included Butte and Plumas Counties, in addition to a 20 km buffer surrounding them (2,277,679 ha of land), on the western slope of the northern Sierra Nevada, California where the range transitions to the southern end of the Cascades (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). The climate is primarily Mediterranean with most of the precipitation occurring in winter, and there is a strong climatic gradient from west to east. Vegetation is also diverse, with grassland, shrubland, and mixed forest dominating the lower-elevation foothills where most of the development is located; conifer forest interspersed with mixed forest and shrublands dominating in the highest elevations; and shrublands again covering most of the lower-elevation eastern slopes of the mountains. Much of the landscape is protected in the Lassen, Plumas, and Tahoe National Forests and Lassen Volcanic National Park, but there has also been substantial residential development in the foothills, extending out of the Chico, CA metropolitan area. Wildfire is an important and frequent natural ecological process in the region. Human-caused ignitions dominate in the lower elevations while lightning is more common in the higher-elevation forests. Recent wildfires in 2008, 2015, and 2017 resulted in more than 1000 structures destroyed and two lost lives in Butte County.
