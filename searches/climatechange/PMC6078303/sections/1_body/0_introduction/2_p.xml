<p class="p">Fire patterns emerge over space and time according to regionally distinctive fire regimes, e.g., via variation in fire size, frequency, area burned, and severity; which derive from a landscape’s climatic, topographic, and vegetative characteristics, plus the timing and distribution of lightning or human-caused ignitions [

Therefore, the idea behind mapping the spatial manifestation of future fire regimes is to model the relationships among and mechanisms behind the primary drivers of recent fire activity, particularly climate, to predict future fire activity as a function of changes in the drivers.
