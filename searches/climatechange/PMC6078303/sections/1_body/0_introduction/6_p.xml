<p class="p">The primary alternative to statistical mapping of future fire activity is to use process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that can explicitly represent and simulate fire-climate-vegetation interactions and feedbacks. These models can simulate the complex nonlinearities and feedbacks that are not possible with static correlational models, however, the geographical distribution of fire in these models remains relatively crude, in part due to the typically coarse resolution associated with modeling on a regional to global scale [
