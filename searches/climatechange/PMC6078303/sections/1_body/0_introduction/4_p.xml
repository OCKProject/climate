<p class="p">Advantages of this top-down statistical approach are that these models are relatively simple to parameterize and provide intuitive mapped output; they provide an assessment of variable importance, thus contributing to theoretical understanding of fire-climate relationships; and they efficiently enable comparisons of alternative climate or management scenarios. Major drawbacks include the assumption of stationary relationships over time and the inability to account for dynamic feedbacks among fire, climate, vegetation, and human activity [
