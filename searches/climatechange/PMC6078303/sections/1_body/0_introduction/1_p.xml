<p class="p">The scientific community is reaching growing consensus that global climate change will significantly alter future wildfire dynamics, e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Thus, a key research and management challenge is to project and map potential future changes in the extent and location of wildfire patterns. Understanding where and how fire patterns may change in the future is critical for fire managers and policy makers trying to develop strategies and anticipate resources needed to prepare for these changes.
