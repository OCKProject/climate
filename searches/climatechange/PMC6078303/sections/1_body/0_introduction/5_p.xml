<p class="p">Despite the importance of vegetation in controlling fire, the overwhelming amount of uncertainty in future vegetation dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] is one argument for excluding vegetation in future fire mapping efforts [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. On the other hand, some efforts have accounted for the spatial distribution of broad fuel types or characteristics by using a static map of vegetation or net primary productivity as a predictor variable in the statistical models and keeping the map constant while climate variables change [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. An alternative approach for explicitly accounting for vegetation has been to assume that certain climate covariates can implicitly account for the primary climatic controls over vegetation that are relevant to fire behavior [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Fire activity tends to be highest at intermediate levels of productivity, resulting from distinctive combinations of temperature and moisture [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. These combinations can be quantified via indices of climatic water balance (i.e., via actual evapotranspiration (AET)) and fuel moisture (i.e., climatic water deficit (CWD)) and used to assume future vegetation conditions [
