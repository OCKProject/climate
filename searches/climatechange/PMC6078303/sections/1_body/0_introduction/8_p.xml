 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], it is important to understand the range of uncertainty imposed by excluding vegetation from climate-based fire projection maps. Therefore, our objective was to assess differences in future fire projections as a result of using different combinations of vegetation maps, in addition to climate and topography, as explanatory variables in a statistically based fire modeling framework. We compared models without vegetation with models that incorporated static vegetation maps in addition to models that included dynamic output vegetation maps from a DGVM that imposed three scenarios of fire (no fire, fire suppression, and fire without suppression). We also ran the DGVM with and without projections of land use change. We mapped the projected future probability of all fires (of any size) and large fires (&gt; = 40 ha) under two climate scenarios in a heterogeneous study area spanning a large elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA.
