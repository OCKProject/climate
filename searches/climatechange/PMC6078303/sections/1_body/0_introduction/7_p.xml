<p class="p">In addition to climate, vegetation, and topography (which is not difficult to account for, as it remains static over time), land use and land cover change may also be significant drivers of future fire activity. Land use patterns, particularly urban development, are spatially correlated with human ignitions [

While few statistical projections of future fire patterns account for dynamic land use change, one study incorporated forecasts of housing extent and density with climate change projections, and results showed that up to 50% of the variation in future fire patterns was due to anthropogenic factors [
