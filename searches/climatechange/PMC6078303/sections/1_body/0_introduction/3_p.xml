<p class="p">The two primary methodological approaches used for mapping future fire activity include statistical-correlative models and process-based simulation models, although projections based on changes in fire danger indices have also been developed [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] in that response functions are estimated based on observations of fire occurrence or frequency in relation to their hypothesized climatic or other human or biophysical environmental drivers [

Fitted models conditioned upon point locations reflecting recent conditions are then used to map the likelihood of fire at unmapped locations in space and time; future fire patterns are mapped by substituting projected future climate maps for the current climate variables used to fit the model [
