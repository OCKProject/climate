<p class="p">Given that the overall performance of our models, reflected in the AUCs, was only moderate to good, there is no way to ascertain which projections of fire are most feasible. There was inherent uncertainty in all of the vegetation variables we considered, including the LANDFIRE map of existing vegetation. While this map may better reflect what is currently on the ground, given that the MC2 vegetation type maps resulted from model simulations beginning in 1895, LANDFIRE has been shown to differ from other maps of existing vegetation [
