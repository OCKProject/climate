<p class="p">Statistical-correlational models and maps of fire probability are widely used for policy and management decisions, and this study suggests high sensitivity to the treatment of vegetation as a predictor variable, particularly for large fires. Depending on the source of vegetation data and GCM, some models resulted in opposite predictions of directional trends in the extent and probability of future fire. This sensitivity was largely due to the high relative importance of vegetation-related variables in the baseline models and the large amount of vegetation change predicted in the vegetation simulations, particularly those that incorporated wildfire.</p>
