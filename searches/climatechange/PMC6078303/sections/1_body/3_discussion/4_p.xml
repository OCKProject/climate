<p class="p">While these projections of vegetation change are substantial, they are also reasonable, as large-scale vegetation type conversion from forest to shrubland with increased high-severity fire is consistently predicted in other studies in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The lower probability of large fires in models with simulated dynamic fire is also consistent with the well-understood self-limiting effect of wildfire on subsequent fire activity in the Sierra Nevada [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Despite the realistic potential for vegetation change to result from increased large-fire activity, the timing of the simulated change here is clearly hypothetical for 2010. That is, because we initiated the simulations with different fire treatments beginning in 1895, the simulated effects on vegetation were already apparent by 2010. However, given that fire suppression effectively minimized large fire activity in the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, the simulation results with no fire better reflect what the current landscape actually looks like.
