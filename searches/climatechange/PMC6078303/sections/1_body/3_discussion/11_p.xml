<p class="p">The appropriate scale and complexity of fire modeling within DGVMs is an open question [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In addition to showing the value of informing statistical fire probability modeling from vegetation modeling results, this study raises the possibility of integrating statistical fire probability modeling within process-based vegetation models. How to best combine these two approaches is a question with rich potential for exploration. Nevertheless, omitting vegetation dynamics entirely could have large implications for management decisions based on statistical projections of future fire activity.
