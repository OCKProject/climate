<p class="p">Assumptions implicit in process-based vegetation models, such as MC2, reflect uncertainties in the processes and drivers of vegetation dynamics. These uncertainties are one of the strongest arguments against the inclusion of vegetation into fire prediction models. However, if, as we have shown, vegetation dynamics influence fire probabilities, these uncertainties are real and their implications should be embraced. While excluding these uncertainties may produce models with greater precision, those models will fail to reflect their own underlying uncertainty. Decisions made based on those models cannot consider the full range of possible futures.</p>
