<p class="p">This means that, in our study area, vegetation variables provided additional information that was not accounted for with water balance indices and climate. One of the largest factors that our models accounted for was the effect of dynamic wildfire on fuels, which cannot be predicted by climate variables alone, as other biophysical and anthropogenic factors influence fire and subsequent fuel patterns [

Mapped vegetation types may also confer additional information because plant speciesâ€™ and community distributions, i.e., the realized niche, are determined by more than just climatic effects on physiological response, e.g., they also result from factors such as inter- or intra-specific competition [
 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. A final consideration is that prior studies relating CWD and AET to fire patterns have been conducted across larger spatial extents, which may suggest that the effect of these variables is scale-dependent.
