<p class="p">Compared to the model without vegetation, the models with the strongest differences in predictions were those that included vegetation dynamics, particularly when there were large changes in nonflammable and shrub vegetation types. For nonflammable vegetation, which primarily increased in the land use scenarios, this is virtually tautological, as the statistical model weighted this strongly towards a low fire probability.</p>
