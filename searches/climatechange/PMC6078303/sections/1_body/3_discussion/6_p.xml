<p class="p">It has been argued that water balance indices derived from climate variables, particularly climatic water deficit (CWD) and actual evapotranspiration (AET), may indirectly account for the potential changes in vegetation that result from climate change, and can thus serve as vegetation proxies in models predicting future fire probability. These assumptions are rooted in a robust literature relating AET with biomass [

 <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. These variables have also been significantly related to geographical patterns of fire at broad scales [
