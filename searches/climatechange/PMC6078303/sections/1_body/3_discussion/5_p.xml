<p class="p">Another effect of simulated wildfire on resulting large fire probability was via the production of dead wood, which had a high permutation of importance in the baseline model that included it. When wildfire and vegetation dynamics were simulated, dead wood tended to be lower on the landscape, thereby reducing the likelihood of its effect on subsequent fire probability. Conversely, when fire was not explicitly simulated, forests grew and expanded. With this persistence, eventual mortality due to climate stress and senescence produced substantial dead wood that in turn increased future fire probability. The higher change in fire probability associated with mixed forests versus needleleaf forests is attributable to the warmer, drier conditions under which mixed forests grew and thereby affected fuels. Therefore, explicitly accounting for vegetation through a dynamic model affects both fuel abundance and condition.</p>
