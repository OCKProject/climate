<p class="p">The largest projected declines in large fire probability were associated with increased shrub vegetation, whereas areas with projected increased fire probability were associated with needleleaf and mixed forested areas. Both of these effects are attributable to the effect of fire on vegetation dynamics. The high frequency and intensity of fire that were simulated without fire suppression, and to a lesser extent with fire suppression, were sufficient to replace forests with shrublands throughout much of the Sierra Nevada portion of the study area.</p>
