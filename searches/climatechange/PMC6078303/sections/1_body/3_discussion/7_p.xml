<p class="p">We considered both of these variables in our experiment, although AET was highly correlated with other climate variables that had better predictive performance, so we only retained CWD and those variables. Nevertheless, CWD did not end up having substantial variable importance. If CWD and AET sufficiently accounted for vegetation, then models with additional vegetation variables would be expected to provide similar predictions. However, our models with maps of vegetation type and dynamics clearly resulted in different conclusions than the models only using climatic vegetation proxies.</p>
