To map future fire patterns, statistical correlative models are typically developed, which associate observed fire locations with recent climate maps, and are then applied to maps of future climate projections. A potential source of uncertainty is the common omission of static or dynamic vegetation as predictor variables. We therefore assessed the sensitivity of future fire projections to different combinations of vegetation maps used as explanatory variables in a statistically based fire modeling framework. We compared models without vegetation to models that incorporated static vegetation maps and that included output from a dynamic vegetation model that imposed three scenarios of fire and one scenario of land use change. We mapped projected future probability of all and large fires (&#x0003e; = 40 ha) under two climate scenarios in a heterogeneous study area spanning a large elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA. Results showed high model sensitivity to the treatment of vegetation as a predictor variable, particularly for models of large fire probability and for models accounting for wildfire effects on vegetation, which lowered future fire probability. Some scenarios resulted in opposite directional trends in the extent and probability of future fire, which could have serious implications for policy and management resource allocation. Model sensitivity resulted from high relative importance of vegetation variables in the baseline models and from large predicted changes in vegetation, particularly when simulating wildfire. Although statistical fire models often omit vegetation due to uncertainty, model sensitivity demonstrated here suggests a need to account for that uncertainty. Coupling statistical and processed based models may be a promising approach to reflect a more plausible range of scenarios.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was completed with funding support from Aspen Environmental Group, although there is no formal grant number (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aspeneg.com/">http://www.aspeneg.com/</ext-link>).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="11"/><table-count count="2"/><page-count count="23"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta id="data-availability"><meta-name>Data Availability</meta-name><meta-value>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta><notes><title>Data Availability</title><p>All relevant data are within the paper and its Supporting Information files.</p></notes></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec001"><title>Introduction</title><p>The scientific community is reaching growing consensus that global climate change will significantly alter future wildfire dynamics, e.g., [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Thus, a key research and management challenge is to project and map potential future changes in the extent and location of wildfire patterns. Understanding where and how fire patterns may change in the future is critical for fire managers and policy makers trying to develop strategies and anticipate resources needed to prepare for these changes.</p><p>Fire patterns emerge over space and time according to regionally distinctive fire regimes, e.g., via variation in fire size, frequency, area burned, and severity; which derive from a landscape&#x02019;s climatic, topographic, and vegetative characteristics, plus the timing and distribution of lightning or human-caused ignitions [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the idea behind mapping the spatial manifestation of future fire regimes is to model the relationships among and mechanisms behind the primary drivers of recent fire activity, particularly climate, to predict future fire activity as a function of changes in the drivers.</p><p>The two primary methodological approaches used for mapping future fire activity include statistical-correlative models and process-based simulation models, although projections based on changes in fire danger indices have also been developed [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The statistical approach is similar to species distribution modeling [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in that response functions are estimated based on observations of fire occurrence or frequency in relation to their hypothesized climatic or other human or biophysical environmental drivers [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Fitted models conditioned upon point locations reflecting recent conditions are then used to map the likelihood of fire at unmapped locations in space and time; future fire patterns are mapped by substituting projected future climate maps for the current climate variables used to fit the model [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>Advantages of this top-down statistical approach are that these models are relatively simple to parameterize and provide intuitive mapped output; they provide an assessment of variable importance, thus contributing to theoretical understanding of fire-climate relationships; and they efficiently enable comparisons of alternative climate or management scenarios. Major drawbacks include the assumption of stationary relationships over time and the inability to account for dynamic feedbacks among fire, climate, vegetation, and human activity [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In particular, the common practice of omitting vegetation dynamics could introduce a major source of uncertainty into model projections, as fuel moisture, abundance, and structure are key controls over fire activity [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Climate change is expected to independently result in dramatic, yet uncertain plant species range shifts due to physiological constraints [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Fire also feeds back strongly with climate and vegetation patterns [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Despite the importance of vegetation in controlling fire, the overwhelming amount of uncertainty in future vegetation dynamics [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] is one argument for excluding vegetation in future fire mapping efforts [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. On the other hand, some efforts have accounted for the spatial distribution of broad fuel types or characteristics by using a static map of vegetation or net primary productivity as a predictor variable in the statistical models and keeping the map constant while climate variables change [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. An alternative approach for explicitly accounting for vegetation has been to assume that certain climate covariates can implicitly account for the primary climatic controls over vegetation that are relevant to fire behavior [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Fire activity tends to be highest at intermediate levels of productivity, resulting from distinctive combinations of temperature and moisture [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These combinations can be quantified via indices of climatic water balance (i.e., via actual evapotranspiration (AET)) and fuel moisture (i.e., climatic water deficit (CWD)) and used to assume future vegetation conditions [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>The primary alternative to statistical mapping of future fire activity is to use process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) that can explicitly represent and simulate fire-climate-vegetation interactions and feedbacks. These models can simulate the complex nonlinearities and feedbacks that are not possible with static correlational models, however, the geographical distribution of fire in these models remains relatively crude, in part due to the typically coarse resolution associated with modeling on a regional to global scale [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>In addition to climate, vegetation, and topography (which is not difficult to account for, as it remains static over time), land use and land cover change may also be significant drivers of future fire activity. Land use patterns, particularly urban development, are spatially correlated with human ignitions [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and land cover change imposes additional modifications to fuel conditions and continuity [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Human influence, in addition to climate, has been shown to be a significant factor in controlling fire patterns in a statistical modeling approach applied to North America [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. While few statistical projections of future fire patterns account for dynamic land use change, one study incorporated forecasts of housing extent and density with climate change projections, and results showed that up to 50% of the variation in future fire patterns was due to anthropogenic factors [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Given that sound management and policy decisions require plausible maps of fire activity patterns [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], it is important to understand the range of uncertainty imposed by excluding vegetation from climate-based fire projection maps. Therefore, our objective was to assess differences in future fire projections as a result of using different combinations of vegetation maps, in addition to climate and topography, as explanatory variables in a statistically based fire modeling framework. We compared models without vegetation with models that incorporated static vegetation maps in addition to models that included dynamic output vegetation maps from a DGVM that imposed three scenarios of fire (no fire, fire suppression, and fire without suppression). We also ran the DGVM with and without projections of land use change. We mapped the projected future probability of all fires (of any size) and large fires (&#x0003e; = 40 ha) under two climate scenarios in a heterogeneous study area spanning a large elevational gradient in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA.</p><p>We asked:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>1) How important is vegetation relative to climate, topography, and land use in statistical-correlative models of fire distribution?</p></list-item><list-item><p>2) Does the explicit integration of vegetation lead to different conclusions about future fire patterns?</p></list-item><list-item><p>3) Are there differences in projections based on the use of static versus dynamic vegetation inputs or dynamic simulations of fire?</p></list-item><list-item><p>4) Are any projected differences in projections mediated by climate scenario or size of fire modeled?</p></list-item></list></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Study area</title><p>The study area included Butte and Plumas Counties, in addition to a 20 km buffer surrounding them (2,277,679 ha of land), on the western slope of the northern Sierra Nevada, California where the range transitions to the southern end of the Cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The region is biophysically heterogeneous and spans an elevational gradient from 11m in the Central Valley to 3128m in Lassen Volcanic National Park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0201680.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The climate is primarily Mediterranean with most of the precipitation occurring in winter, and there is a strong climatic gradient from west to east. Vegetation is also diverse, with grassland, shrubland, and mixed forest dominating the lower-elevation foothills where most of the development is located; conifer forest interspersed with mixed forest and shrublands dominating in the highest elevations; and shrublands again covering most of the lower-elevation eastern slopes of the mountains. Much of the landscape is protected in the Lassen, Plumas, and Tahoe National Forests and Lassen Volcanic National Park, but there has also been substantial residential development in the foothills, extending out of the Chico, CA metropolitan area. Wildfire is an important and frequent natural ecological process in the region. Human-caused ignitions dominate in the lower elevations while lightning is more common in the higher-elevation forests. Recent wildfires in 2008, 2015, and 2017 resulted in more than 1000 structures destroyed and two lost lives in Butte County.</p><fig id="pone.0201680.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0201680.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>a) Butte and Plumas Counties study area in the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, and b) elevation (meters).

MC2 [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] is a process-based model used at global to regional scales to simulate potential vegetation, carbon fluxes and pools, and wildfire. MC2 runs on a monthly timestep over a spatial grid, with each grid cell simulated independently.</p><p>Three modules simulate biogeochemistry, biogeography, and wildfire. The biogeochemistry module simulates water, carbon, and nutrient flows between pools based on climate, soil, and starting state. The biogeography component of the model determines the potential life forms and dynamic vegetation types on the landscape, which are defined based on a set of climate and biomass threshold rules. In the model simulations, vegetation types (not species) shift in response to climate change and atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Competition between woody vegetation and grass is simulated as a function of light, nitrogen, and available soil water. The model generates output for various live and dead carbon pools, carbon fluxes, fuel characteristics, hydrologic fluxes, and vegetation characteristics.</p><p>Fire is simulated as a discrete event with impacts including mortality and aboveground biomass consumption. A wildfire is triggered when a cell&#x02019;s fuel condition exceeds its vegetation type&#x02019;s fuel threshold. Ignitions are assumed and a cell is limited to one fire per year. Fire suppression effectively sets a vegetation type&#x02019;s fuel condition threshold higher under the assumption that fires occurring under less severe fuel conditions can be extinguished. The fraction of a cell burned is limited to the years since last fire divided by its vegetation type&#x02019;s fire return interval.</p><p>Land use land cover (LULC) inputs used with the MC2 simulations were Sleeter et al.&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]; hereafter Sleeter) business as usual (BAU) scenario projections. We aggregated Sleeter&#x02019;s development and transportation development classes into a single developed class and aggregated all classes unaffected by human activity into natural. This produced five land use classes for the model: developed, mining, annual agriculture, perennial agriculture, and natural. Within MC2, when land is converted from natural to one of the other classes, all above- and belowground vegetation components are removed. No vegetation grows in developed and mining cells. Annual crops grow as grasses and harvest removes all aboveground live carbon, 90% of aboveground dead carbon, 50% of belowground dead carbon. 95% of belowground living carbon is killed. Perennial crops grow as wild, with no harvest their first five years, removal of 90% dead carbon and 50% of live growing season production during years 5&#x02013;40, and complete removal and restart after year 40. Fire is excluded from croplands.</p><p>MC2 is run in four separate phases: <italic>equilibrium</italic> to attain stable carbon pools and vegetation cover; <italic>spinup</italic> to readjust carbon pools and vegetation types in response to dynamic fire; <italic>historical transient</italic>, driven by observation based climate data; and <italic>future transient</italic>, driven by projected future climate data.

Results were clipped the output to the extent of our study area. Outputs were resampled to match the climate data grid.

The fire and land use scenarios were applied over the entire duration of the MC2 simulations, from 1895 through 2100.

We ran the baselines with 5 cross-validated replicates to get a mean 5-fold CV AUC and permutation importance values. For the future projections under different climate and vegetation scenarios, we projected the baseline models onto maps of future conditions for all time steps.</p><sec id="sec011"><title>Analysis</title><p>To compare all scenarios, we first calculated the total predicted suitable area of all and large fires by applying a threshold to create binary maps. We used a threshold of maximum sensitivity plus specificity because it has been shown to optimize discrimination between presence and absence data [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. From the resulting binary maps for all scenarios and time steps, we then summed the total area predicted suitable. In addition to the area predicted suitable for fires, we calculated the mean probability of all or large fires for all scenarios by summing the total predicted probabilities across all grid cells then dividing by the number of cells in the map.</p><p>To characterize the detailed effects of modeled vegetation and related processes on large fire probability, we compared NoVeg fire probabilities with those from three scenarios with vegetation (WithVeg) ModStatFireLU, ModDynFireLU, and ModDynLU for each of the three time periods and each climate future. Difference maps were produced by subtracting NoVeg probabilities from each of the WithVeg scenarios. Differences were tabulated for each combination of: vegetation type, time period, scenario, climate future. Aggregate distributions of probability differences were plotted by vegetation type for each climate future.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec012"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec013"><title>Climate and vegetation modeling results</title><p>Over the entire region, compared to historical values, CNRM projected increases in annual and summer precipitation throughout the 21<sup>st</sup> c. with a maximum annual increase of 42% at the end of the century (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0201680.s002">S2 Table</xref>). MIROC, on the other hand, projected slightly higher annual precipitation initially followed by lower precipitation, with a decrease of 17% by the end of the century, although summer precipitation was projected to increase.

Compared with LANDFIRE, MC2 vegetation had more shrubland in the Central Valley and Cascade foothills, with less nonflammable area in the Central Valley and less mixed and broadleaf cover at lower elevation. MC2 baseline had more mixed and broadleaf ranging higher into the Cascade foothills where needleaf dominated under LANDFIRE.

Depending on the source of vegetation data and GCM, some models resulted in opposite predictions of directional trends in the extent and probability of future fire. This sensitivity was largely due to the high relative importance of vegetation-related variables in the baseline models and the large amount of vegetation change predicted in the vegetation simulations, particularly those that incorporated wildfire.</p><p>Compared to the model without vegetation, the models with the strongest differences in predictions were those that included vegetation dynamics, particularly when there were large changes in nonflammable and shrub vegetation types. For nonflammable vegetation, which primarily increased in the land use scenarios, this is virtually tautological, as the statistical model weighted this strongly towards a low fire probability.</p><p>The largest projected declines in large fire probability were associated with increased shrub vegetation, whereas areas with projected increased fire probability were associated with needleleaf and mixed forested areas. Both of these effects are attributable to the effect of fire on vegetation dynamics. The high frequency and intensity of fire that were simulated without fire suppression, and to a lesser extent with fire suppression, were sufficient to replace forests with shrublands throughout much of the Sierra Nevada portion of the study area.</p><p>While these projections of vegetation change are substantial, they are also reasonable, as large-scale vegetation type conversion from forest to shrubland with increased high-severity fire is consistently predicted in other studies in the region [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. The lower probability of large fires in models with simulated dynamic fire is also consistent with the well-understood self-limiting effect of wildfire on subsequent fire activity in the Sierra Nevada [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Despite the realistic potential for vegetation change to result from increased large-fire activity, the timing of the simulated change here is clearly hypothetical for 2010. That is, because we initiated the simulations with different fire treatments beginning in 1895, the simulated effects on vegetation were already apparent by 2010. However, given that fire suppression effectively minimized large fire activity in the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the simulation results with no fire better reflect what the current landscape actually looks like.</p><p>Another effect of simulated wildfire on resulting large fire probability was via the production of dead wood, which had a high permutation of importance in the baseline model that included it. When wildfire and vegetation dynamics were simulated, dead wood tended to be lower on the landscape, thereby reducing the likelihood of its effect on subsequent fire probability. Conversely, when fire was not explicitly simulated, forests grew and expanded. With this persistence, eventual mortality due to climate stress and senescence produced substantial dead wood that in turn increased future fire probability. The higher change in fire probability associated with mixed forests versus needleleaf forests is attributable to the warmer, drier conditions under which mixed forests grew and thereby affected fuels. Therefore, explicitly accounting for vegetation through a dynamic model affects both fuel abundance and condition.</p><p>It has been argued that water balance indices derived from climate variables, particularly climatic water deficit (CWD) and actual evapotranspiration (AET), may indirectly account for the potential changes in vegetation that result from climate change, and can thus serve as vegetation proxies in models predicting future fire probability. These assumptions are rooted in a robust literature relating AET with biomass [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and CWD with drought, vegetation distributions, and fire [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0201680.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. These variables have also been significantly related to geographical patterns of fire at broad scales [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>].</p><p>We considered both of these variables in our experiment, although AET was highly correlated with other climate variables that had better predictive performance, so we only retained CWD and those variables. Nevertheless, CWD did not end up having substantial variable importance. If CWD and AET sufficiently accounted for vegetation, then models with additional vegetation variables would be expected to provide similar predictions. However, our models with maps of vegetation type and dynamics clearly resulted in different conclusions than the models only using climatic vegetation proxies.</p><p>This means that, in our study area, vegetation variables provided additional information that was not accounted for with water balance indices and climate. One of the largest factors that our models accounted for was the effect of dynamic wildfire on fuels, which cannot be predicted by climate variables alone, as other biophysical and anthropogenic factors influence fire and subsequent fuel patterns [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Mapped vegetation types may also confer additional information because plant species&#x02019; and community distributions, i.e., the realized niche, are determined by more than just climatic effects on physiological response, e.g., they also result from factors such as inter- or intra-specific competition [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. A final consideration is that prior studies relating CWD and AET to fire patterns have been conducted across larger spatial extents, which may suggest that the effect of these variables is scale-dependent.</p><p>Given that the overall performance of our models, reflected in the AUCs, was only moderate to good, there is no way to ascertain which projections of fire are most feasible. There was inherent uncertainty in all of the vegetation variables we considered, including the LANDFIRE map of existing vegetation. While this map may better reflect what is currently on the ground, given that the MC2 vegetation type maps resulted from model simulations beginning in 1895, LANDFIRE has been shown to differ from other maps of existing vegetation [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>], and mapped vegetation types in general always connote some level of uncertainty [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref073" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>].</p><p>Assumptions implicit in process-based vegetation models, such as MC2, reflect uncertainties in the processes and drivers of vegetation dynamics. These uncertainties are one of the strongest arguments against the inclusion of vegetation into fire prediction models. However, if, as we have shown, vegetation dynamics influence fire probabilities, these uncertainties are real and their implications should be embraced. While excluding these uncertainties may produce models with greater precision, those models will fail to reflect their own underlying uncertainty. Decisions made based on those models cannot consider the full range of possible futures.</p><p>The appropriate scale and complexity of fire modeling within DGVMs is an open question [<xref rid="pone.0201680.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In addition to showing the value of informing statistical fire probability modeling from vegetation modeling results, this study raises the possibility of integrating statistical fire probability modeling within process-based vegetation models. How to best combine these two approaches is a question with rich potential for exploration. Nevertheless, omitting vegetation dynamics entirely could have large implications for management decisions based on statistical projections of future fire activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201680.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Classification of LANDFIRE existing and MC2 dynamic vegetation types into broad classes.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201680.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201680.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Values for climate variables used in statistical models for the study area and broken out by elevation.</title><p>(CWD: climatic water deficit; PPT_ANN: annual precipitation; PPT_SUMM: summer precipitation; TMEAN_COV: temperature seasonality; TMIN: annual minimum temperature; Min: minimum, Max: maximum; StDev: standard deviation).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201680.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0201680.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Change in large fire probability versus the NoVeg scenario by scenario, time period, climate future, and vegetation type.</title><p>(SD: standard deviation; Num Cells: number of cells within the study area with specified vegetation type).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0201680.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Aspen for funding this work, and we also thank Gladwin Joseph and Jim Strittholt for guidance and insights during the development of our experimental design.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0201680.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Bowman</surname><given-names>DMJS</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Balch</surname><given-names>JK</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Artaxo</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bond</surname><given-names>WJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Carlson</surname><given-names>JM</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Cochrane</surname><given-names>MA</given-names></name>, <etal>et al</etal>
