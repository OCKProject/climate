<p class="p">Otherwise, when a longer time-series (1950â€“2016) is considered, we observe a significant increasing trend in rainfall, which should be interpreted distinctly in relation to the dynamics of MAC in the PL system. Although no complete time-series of MAC or other cyanobacteria is available for this whole period, we could expect that MAC blooms tended to be advected to the outlet of the PL system after and during time periods of heavy rain. However, the lack of data prevents us from affirming whether these MAC blooms had not happened in the past decades.</p>
