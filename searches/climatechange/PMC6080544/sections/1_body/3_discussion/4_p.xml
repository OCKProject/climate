<p class="p">In summer and autumn, the growth and patch development of cyanobacteria are typically registered (Yunes, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), and NE wind is predominant in the region. Considering this wind pattern and the high prevalence of cyanobacteria, we suggest that cyanobacteria surface scums can be transported from the northern region to the southern estuarine portion of PL and to its adjacent coastal region. Also, some advection of cyanobacterial patches may occur to the west margin of this aquatic system where many cities are located, as seen in a LandSat8 ETM+ image for February-2017 (see Figure
