<p class="p">Since the tidal range in PL is low (amplitude 0.4 m) and the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the action of wind and freshwater discharge (Möller et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; Vaz et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), the NE wind pattern could partially explain the observations of high numbers of cyanobacteria near the cities of Tapes (4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and São Lourenço do Sul (2.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cells mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in summer period of 2011–2012 (as seen at Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>). Then, coupled with high rainfall periods, NE winds should accelerate the export of MAC biomass to the coastal region. In contrast, southerly winds are more important during the winter periods, from June to September (data not shown), when the passage of frontal polar systems (Stech and Lorenzetti, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>; Klein, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>) cause many environmental alterations in the phytoplankton dynamics (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010a</xref>).
