<p class="p">In short, we can suggest that these MAC blooms will tend to be more critical during low rainfall periods and/or negative summer anomalies seen in the 3.4-ENSO index (December to February, at least, but appearing up to April-May next year). At the same time, the westward NE wind-associating advection of these potentially toxic, cyanobacterial patches can be a serious threat to human health at the margins of some cities. Otherwise, heavy rainfall precipitation/positive anomalies of the 3.4-ENSO index should alleviate the permanence of these MAC blooms near these cities. As well, there should be an export of organic suspended material and cyanotoxins to the estuary of Patos Lagoon and to the immediate coastal region.</p>
