 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic> might outcompete other phytoplankton species under nutrient-depleted waters (e.g., poor in Si) and within the stronger thermal-stratified water column, which are conditions normally found in the summer period (Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref> and references therein). However, this scenario of the nutrient-limited condition should not be the case of the PL system (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), where light has been considered the main limiting factor for phytoplankton growth (Abreu et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Particularly, MAC has proved to display a fairly complex life cycle with different colony sizes within the PL (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>) and in accordance to the literature (Reynolds et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1981</xref>), which can add to their fitness within a varying light ambient.
