<p class="p">The earliest published data of laboratory tests of toxicity of cyanobacteria in the Patos Lagoon system dated back to late summer 1994 (Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), when the culture of 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> complex (MAC) labeled as 
 <italic class="italic">M. aeruginosa</italic> RST9501 strain was initiated. The predominant species in all these blooms were always related to MAC, while other species rarely occurred. In general, those microcystin-related toxicity tests gave positive results for the crustaceans 
 <italic class="italic">Ceriodaphnia dubia</italic> (Monteiro et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Artemia salina</italic> (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>) and the native estuarine species 
 <italic class="italic">Kalliapseudes schubartii</italic> (Montagnolli et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) and, also toxin accumulation by the white clam 
 <italic class="italic">Mesodesma mactroides</italic> (Le√£o et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Among the microcystin variants detected within the Patos Lagoon system, D-Leu microcystin LR was the predominant form synthesized by those 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic> blooms during summer (Matthiensen et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). As far as we know, only a biodegradation process carried by heterotrophic bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Burkholderia</italic> appeared to diminish microcystins concentration into sediments and water column (Lemes et al., 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>).
