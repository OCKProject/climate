<p class="p">Moreover, the majority of works related to MAC in the PL focused on its potential toxicity with environmental and human health impacts (Yunes, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref> and references therein). Likewise, those works compiled in Table 
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> pointed out that the massive blooms formed in pre-limnic and limnic waters of the PL would exert their potential noxious effects depending on the wind-driven hydrodynamics as described here. These blooms can even be an undesirable feature in human activities, such as fishing and leisure, along with the beaches and cities of PL margins (Yunes, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
