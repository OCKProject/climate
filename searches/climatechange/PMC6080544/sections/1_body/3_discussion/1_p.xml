<p class="p">We have used data of air temperature, annual precipitation, and river discharge to conduct this long-term study aiming to relate cyanobacteria abundance, mainly blooms of MAC, with meteorological and hydrographic variability in the Patos Lagoon system. For the period of 2001–2017 we found somehow an association between the ENSO effect and the records of cyanobacteria concentrations &gt;10

It seems that low rainfall related to negative anomalies of ENSO index could mean the MAC populations should not be quickly advected from the limnic parts of the PL system. This dynamic could make more apparent the biomass accumulation of MAC across that limnic region. However, there will be necessary further studies on hydrodynamics and water residence time in order to draw a comprehensive picture of the frequency and intensity of MAC blooms along the whole PL system. Also, we clearly identified that a monitoring program on these MAC blooms need to be implemented as these microcystin-producing species have been raised worldwide (Preece et al.,

 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic> blooms have been more common both in freshwater ambients and contiguous estuarine and marine systems, for instance, in the Argentinean and Uruguayan coastal regions under influence of Río de La Plata, many European nearshore aquatic systems and USA estuaries and bays (Preece et al.,

Coupling with climate change effects, many works stated that hydrologic alterations including intense storms and prolonged droughts followed by increased rainfalls will lead to increased freshwater inputs; and these hydrologic shifts can transport nutrients, dilute coastal receiving waters, promote cyanoHABs, and increase the occurrence of microcystins within those ambients (Paerl and Huisman,
