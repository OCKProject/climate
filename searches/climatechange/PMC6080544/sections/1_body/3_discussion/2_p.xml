<p class="p">ENSO influence over the hydrological cycle on the southernmost part of Brazil is fairly well known (e.g., Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010b</xref>). These ENSO influence and rainfall effects on phytoplankton dynamics, not specifically on cyanobacteria, have already been discussed for the years from 1993 to 2012 (e.g., Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). These authors observed that high rainfall and river discharge periods are associated with low phytoplankton biomass. Also, they showed that dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria presented an increasing trend in relative contribution to the phytoplankton community in the estuarine region of PL (Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>).
