<p class="p">Despite our short time-series, the decreasing trend in river discharge could be associated with the years of low rainfall (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>), and are coincidental with the available high cyanobacteria estimates. As saltwater intrusion seems to increase the retention times promoting phytoplankton blooms during low runoff periods in the PL estuary (Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>; Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), we might suggest that these periods could also favor the development of cyanobacteria blooms in the upper parts of the PL due to a longer retention time. As the season progresses, a part of these cyanobacterial blooms could be advected to the estuary and coastal region, mainly during high rainfall periods (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>), probably coupled with the NE winds. Furthermore, this kind of event has been seen during field surveys (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>) and MAC development within the PL does depend upon salt intrusion to make phosphates available from sediments and increase the pH suitable for cyanobacteria (Yunes, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>).
