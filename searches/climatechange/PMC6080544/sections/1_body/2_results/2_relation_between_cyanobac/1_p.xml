<p class="p">Estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> complex (MAC) and/or other cyanobacteria in non-bloom conditions for the summer periods (December–February) of 2011–2017 are presented (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Blooms were noticed in both cities of Tapes and São Lourenço do Sul at the west margin of PL during the summer period of 2011–2012 with similar concentration (maximum up to 4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> cell mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The highest abundance was determined for the summer of 2016–2017 in Tapes only (attaining 2.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> cell mL
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), when there was a bloom of MAC. During this latter period, intense chlorophyll-
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> stripes were visible in an image derived from the Landsat-8 ETM+ but mainly near São Lourenço do Sul and Pelotas (see Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). In the other summer periods, filamentous cyanobacteria were prominent such as 
 <italic class="italic">Dolichospermum, Gleiterinema</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Limnothrix</italic> along with chroococcaleans (
 <italic class="italic">Merismopedia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic>) denoting a mixed assemblage of cyanobacteria species (Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In the summer of 2011–2012, benthic filaments of 
 <italic class="italic">Anabaena</italic> spp. were also noticed.
