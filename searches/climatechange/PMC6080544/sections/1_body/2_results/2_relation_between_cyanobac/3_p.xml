<p class="p">Some observations or published data of MAC across the PL system were overlaid as numbers on the annual precipitation from 1950 to 2016–2017 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). There were registered high abundances of MAC only on the negative anomaly of annual precipitation, i.e., over dry years, specifically in 1988, 1994, 2006, 2010–2012, and 2017 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">6</xref>). These published data described these years associated with long water residence time and strong thermal stratification in the Patos Lagoon.
