<p class="p">A non-significant, decreasing trend in river discharge from 2001 to 2014 was calculated (slope = −0.0296 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>/yr; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.29) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>), and low values were generally observed during the summer periods (January to March; data not shown). In contrast, the period from 1950 to 2016 revealed no trend in air temperature (slope = 0.0035°C/yr; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.26) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2B</xref>) but a significant positive rainfall trend (slope = 3.9868 mm/yr; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2C</xref>). From 2001 to 2016, some years were highlighted (2001–2008, 2012 and 2014–2015) by positive anomalies and other few years (2009–2011, 2013 and 2016) with negative air temperature anomalies (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>). Positive precipitation anomalies were observed for 2001–2003, 2007, 2009, 2011 and 2013–2015 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>). The years with more pronounced positive anomalies in air temperature and annual precipitation were particularly 2001–2002 and 2014–2015. At the time interval of 2001–2013, the wind rose charts showed a typical pattern of dominant north-easterly winds (~35%) for summer (from December to February next year) reflecting the pattern in the whole period (Fig. 4). This predominance of NE wind ranged from 16.7% in 2005–2006 up to ~47% in 2007–2008 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>), however, it was noteworthy that the number of valid data points in 2005–2006 was lower (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 860) than in other summer periods (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 2130–2190).
