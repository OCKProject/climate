<p class="p">Considering all the information above, this work addresses an environmental characterization of cyanoHABs (related to MAC) under an interannual variability context, in the PL system and presents some other cyanobacteria species found in non-bloom conditions. Additionally, the role played by the meteorological variables wind speed and direction and rainfall, and freshwater run-off on the occurrence of these blooms of MAC is investigated. Lastly, this study discusses the influence of global warming effects on the meteorological interannual variability and over the intensity and temporal variation of MAC blooms in the PL system.</p>
