<p class="p">Increasing trends in frequency and intensity of cyanobacterial blooms in several aquatic systems have been observed worldwide (Paerl and Huisman, 
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Paerl and Otten, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Cloern et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>; Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Many cyanobacteria of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic> Lemmermann 1907, can affect the environment and trigger shifts in trophic structure and dynamics, influencing their competitors, consumers and decomposers (Paerl and Pinckney, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>; Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> (Kützing) Kützing 1846 (hereafter referred as to MAC for 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> complex) can bring about economic issues to the fisheries and production of cultivated animals because they are microcystin producers, a hepatotoxin that can potentially affect invertebrates and some vertebrates (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>). Interestingly, some new brands of microcystin variants found in benthic cyanobacterial mats from Svalbard archipelago appear to have a neurotoxic potential (Kleinteich et al., 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). More seriously, harmful cyanobacteria blooms (cyanoHABs) can pose health problems to populations living in cities located near aquatic systems recurrently affected by these biological features (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998b</xref>; Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>).
