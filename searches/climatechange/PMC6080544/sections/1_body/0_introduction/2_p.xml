<p class="p">A recent review has already been shown that these microcystins can be raised in importance through many coastal ecosystems; yet estuarine and marine waters are under-investigated (Preece et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). For instance, MAC biomass should be advected from freshwater to marine systems as into the San Francisco Bay estuary (Lehman et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). As well 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic> and other cyanoHABs have been reported since the 1980s in the Baltic Sea (Suikkanen et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>; Preece et al., 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) under a climate change scenario and shifts of hydrological cycle (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). CyanoHABs have been strongly related with short-term environmental variations both in space and time scales (e.g., seasonal cycles) (Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref> and references therein). As primary producers' uptake tends to lower the nutrient levels within the water bodies and strong water column stratification takes place, cyanoHABs can be favored as seen during summer periods worldwide. Furthermore, nutrient pulses into lagoonal systems and coastal regions, mainly of nitrogenous forms, originated by anthropogenic activities might be relatively higher than the natural inputs with uncertain environmental and economic consequences (Battye et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). This kind of anthropogenic influence has been associated with the increasing trend of cyanoHABs (Paerl, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref> and references therein).
