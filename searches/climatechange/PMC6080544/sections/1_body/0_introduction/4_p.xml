<p class="p">These variations can also be linked to global warming trend effects on primary producers. For instance, there is an increasing trend in the relative contribution of dinoflagellates and cyanobacteria to the phytoplankton community in parallel with high diatom growth in the estuarine region of PL system (Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Long-term studies (1993–2012) revealed that high rainfall and river discharge periods tend to present very low phytoplankton biomass (Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), whereas cyanoHABs can be advected from the northernmost parts of PL system to the coastal region (Yunes, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Reports indicate that these limnic cyanoHABs can notably be seen along the coastline close to the outlet channel of PL system, mainly during warmer months (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>). In addition, other studies have observed massive cyanoHABs under La Niña typical conditions (low rainfall and river discharge) (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>; Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Conversely, during El Niño when annual precipitation and river discharge is high in the region, low phytoplankton biomass is observed within the PL system (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010a</xref>).
