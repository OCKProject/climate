<p class="p">The predominance of cyanobacteria in summer periods has been observed in the Patos Lagoon (PL) system, southern Brazil. PL is characterized as a mainly light-limited environment and, sporadically in some winters, co-limited by light and nutrients (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010a</xref>). For instance, the effect of nutrient inputs has been partly associated with anthropogenic eutrophication processes within the estuarine region (Niencheski and Baumgarten, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>; Haraguchi et al., 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, no studies have investigated the annual frequency and intensity of cyanoHABs in the PL system. And long-term changes in these features can be associated to anthropogenic eutrophication (from agricultural, domestic/urban and industrial sources) or related to natural meteo-hydrological variability in the region (wind, rainfall, river discharge).
