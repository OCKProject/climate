<p class="p">This study uses cyanobacterial bloom (related to MAC) and non-bloom data in an interannual variability context, from few records beginning in the 1980s to summer periods from 2011 to 2017. Available estimates of cyanobacteria composition and/or abundance were obtained from the State Foundation for Environmental Protection Agency (FEPAM;

FEPAM conducts a monitoring program at recreational beaches in the Patos Lagoon during warm periods (November/December to February/March) and after notification of any massive, visible cyanobacteria patches. FEPAM has been estimating cyanobacteria abundance for Tapes (30.66°S, 051.39°W; from 2011 to 2017) and for São Lourenço do Sul (31.38°S, 051.96°W; only from Nov2011 to Feb2012). Sedgewick-Rafter counting chamber was used to determine the abundance of cyanobacteria (cell mL

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), we have strictly followed the list of species found for those cities above, even with some species assembled in the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Anabaena</italic>. The presence of the benthic cyanobacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Anabaena</italic> could be ascribed to the sampling points placed near the margins (&lt;1 m), where resuspension could have mixed planktonic and benthic species. Besides these estimates, data from published studies on cyanobacterial blooms in the region (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>; Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>; Rosa and Garcia, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) were revisited in order to draw the relationship between these blooms and meteorological/hydrological parameters in a long-term approach. Moreover, a review of all experimental and field data available of levels/effects of toxins produced by these cyanobacteria, especially of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis</italic>, are discussed to illustrate their potential threats to ecosystem functions and services to the cities bordering the Patos Lagoon.
