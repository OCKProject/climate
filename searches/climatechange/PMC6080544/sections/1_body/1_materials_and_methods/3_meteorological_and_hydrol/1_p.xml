<p class="p">A database encompassing multiple sources of meteorological information since 1950, including precipitation and air temperature data, was used in this work for drawing trend lines. Data from a Brazilian meteorological station in the Rio Grande (INMET, Rio Grande) were obtained for the period from 2001 to March 2017 (end of austral summer). Daily river discharge data were obtained from the National Water Agency (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), where each monthly mean river discharge was calculated, and the relative contribution of a river to the combined discharge was used to estimate for those missing monthly discharges. Recent data of wind speed and direction (from 2001 to 2013) were also obtained from a meteorological station in the Rio Grande city (near the navigational channel), and used in the free software WRPLOT (

In order to relate this wind pattern with the summer cyanobacterial patches, wind roses for the austral summer period from December to February were presented. 3.4-ENSO (El Niño Southern Oscillation) index (
