<p class="p">The study region is the Patos Lagoon system (30°12′-32°12′S, 050°40′-052°15′W), a subtropical coastal lagoon located in the southernmost part of Brazil (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>). It is the second largest waterbody in Brazil and the largest lagoonal complex in South America. The lagoon waters span 320 km to the north and between 3 and 64 km wide. A drainage basin of approximately 200,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> formed by several rivers, provides 75–80% of freshwater to the Patos Lagoon estuary. Lagoon waters are used for drinking supply, fisheries, leisure, navigation, and agriculture and receive domestic and industrial sewage. Dissolved nutrients (from river inputs) transit ~225 km from the north before reaching the estuarine area at the Feitoria Channel (31°41′S and 051°55′W). The sea provides another 10% of water and nutrient input. The São Gonçalo River completes the volume of estuarine waters and also supplies water to houses, industries, and farms in the region. Cyanobacterial blooms of 
 <italic class="italic">Microcystis aeruginosa</italic> complex (MAC) are frequent in the estuary waters mainly during summer months. Although the first scientific record dates back to 1987 (Odebrecht et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1987</xref>), anecdotal evidence of these cyanobacterial blooms across the PL estuary from old local villagers dates back to the beginning of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century (Yunes et al., 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1998a</xref>). More details on environmental characteristics and hydrology in this region are presented in Yunes et al. (
