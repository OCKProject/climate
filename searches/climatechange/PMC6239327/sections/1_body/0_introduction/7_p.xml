<p class="p">In semiarid regions of Canada, nitrate leaching from cropland can still take place and impact water quality depending on the timing of the precipitation events in relationship to nitrogen application and crop uptake [

However, studies in these two different climatic zones have focused on assessing the effects of future climate change scenarios on crop growth and N

Therefore, evaluating the impacts of climate change on soil nitrogen leaching and exploring potential adaptation measures to reduce leaching while increasing crop yield are essential to supporting policy decisions for food security. The main objectives of this study were to: (1) simulate the potential impacts of climate change on spring wheat and maize yields, soil water balance and nitrate leaching; (2) explore adaptation measures to obtain high crop yields and low nitrate leaching losses under different climate change scenarios in the semiarid regions of the Western Canada (Swift Current, Saskatchewan) and the more humid regions of Eastern Canada (Woodslee, Ontario).
