<p class="p">Global fertilizer N application has greatly contributed to increased food and feed production since the early 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. However, substantial amounts of fertilizer nitrogen could be lost from agricultural systems to the atmosphere through volatilization (NH
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) and denitrification (e.g., N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and to rivers and lakes through leaching or runoff (NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) which in turn contributes to low nitrogen use efficiency by crops[
