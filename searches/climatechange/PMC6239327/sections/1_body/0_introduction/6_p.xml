 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations in the future could significantly impact the fluxes of soil mineral N and N leaching [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Patil et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] modelled the impact of changes in climatic variables on both winter wheat yield and nitrate leaching from soils in Denmark, and indicated that N leaching increased with temperature, particularly for coarse, sandy soils compared to the sandy, loam soils. Similarly, Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] reported that soil nitrate leaching in tile drainage under future climate conditions increased by 34% for a corn-soybean rotation cropping system compared to the historical climate in Iowa, USA, which was attributed to the reduced corn N uptake. Modelling studies have examined whether management practices (crop rotation, tillage and fertilizer optimization), could reduce N leaching and increase crop yields under future climatic conditions. For example, Biggs et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] found that optimizing fertilizer and tillage management practices would be important to reduce N loss with deep drainage under future climate change scenarios. Chauhan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] predicted that a rotation including wet-season peanut and dry-season maize could result in greater yields and reduced N losses compared to the conventional rotation with wet-season maize and dry-season peanut under climate projections in Australia.
