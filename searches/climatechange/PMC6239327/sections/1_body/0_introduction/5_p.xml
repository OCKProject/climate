<p class="p">Integrated assessments of N losses have been conducted to evaluate serious N leakage (e.g., NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, N

Although a series of environmental policies were adopted and contributed to decreasing N losses, the nitrate concentrations in groundwater and surface waters were still high, which threatened human health and water quality. In Canada, modelling studies on residual soil nitrogen (RSN) and nitrate leaching in farmland from 1981 to 2011 have been conducted [

 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Annual RSN levels (i.e., annual RSN = N input–N output) increased from 9.4 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in 1981 to 23.6 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> in 2011 in Canadian farmland. However, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> leaching loss varied from 3–14% of the RSN in the semi-arid regions of Western Canada whereas 33–90% of RSN was lost in the more humid regions in Eastern Canada as a result of different climatic conditions, soil types and cropping systems [
