<p class="p">Adaptation measures of increasing fertilizer N rate from 50 (default) to 80–100 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> could significantly increase wheat yield, however nitrate leaching would increase by 5–8 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> at Swift Current. The fertilizer N rate of 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is required to obtain high maize yields with low nitrate leaching under future climate conditions at Woodslee. Early planting could contribute to a higher wheat yield under baseline and future RCP8.5 scenarios at Swift Current, whereas late planting dates could reduce the negative impacts of climate change on maize production at Woodslee. Developing longer growing-season wheat and maize cultivars should be recommended as an adaptive management strategy to optimize wheat and maize yields production meanwhile minimize soil nitrate leaching under changing climatic conditions.
