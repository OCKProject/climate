<p class="p">Climate change impacts on spring wheat and maize yields, soil water balance and soil nitrogen dynamics were determined using the DSSAT model. Simulation results indicated that the spring wheat yields increased and maize yields decreased under future RCP scenarios, respectively. Increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and precipitation had a positive impact on crop yields, but temperature showed significant negative effects on spring wheat and maize yields. In this study, ET increased for both locations under future RCP scenarios. Significant increases in cumulative drainage water losses were found under RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios compared to baseline scenarios as a result of the higher annual precipitation. More nitrate leaching occurred during the growing season at Swift Current whereas it was during non-growing season at Woodslee. Annual average nitrate leaching increased significantly at Woodslee under future climate scenarios mainly due to the future high temperature stress and increased precipitations that resulted in low crop N removal and increased drainage.
