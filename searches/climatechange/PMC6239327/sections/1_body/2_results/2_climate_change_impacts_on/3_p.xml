<p class="p">The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test for comparison of the CDFs of wheat and maize yields between climate change and baseline scenarios showed that the CDFs are significantly different from baseline yields using the D statistic (Table E in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The results showed that RCP8.5 2080s was the only scenario which had a significant D statistic for spring wheat yields (D = 0.37), whereas all the climate scenarios significantly affected maize yields (D ranged from 0.60–0.93) compared to the baseline scenarios (

Increased temperature significantly impacted the CDFs of spring wheat yields for RCP4.5 2080s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios while temperature significantly impacted all the CDFs for maize yields under all four scenarios (Figures C and D, and Table E in
