<p class="p">Compared with the baseline scenarios, the average number of cold days (&lt;4°C) decreased by about 6–13 days and hot days (&gt;30°C) increased by more than 20 days during the spring wheat season under future RCP scenarios at Swift Current (
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The average number of cold days decreased by about 10–16 days and hot days increased by more than 30 days during the maize growing season at Woodslee under future RCP scenarios (
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Under future climate change scenarios, the predicted anthesis dates were 7–10 days and 10–16 days earlier than the baseline (68 and 71 days after planting) for spring wheat and maize, respectively (
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Similarly, the predicted maturity dates were 9–18 days and 37–56 days earlier than the baseline (100 and 155 days after planting) for spring wheat and maize, respectively.
