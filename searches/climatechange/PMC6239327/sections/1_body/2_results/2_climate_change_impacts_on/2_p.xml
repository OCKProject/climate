<p class="p">The changes in cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the projection years were compared with the baseline for RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s to analyze the effects of climate change factors on wheat and maize growth yields (

However, projected temperature changes significantly decreased wheat yields with substantial differences were found among projected scenarios as illustrated by the lowest yields associated with RCP8.5 for the 2080’s period (Figure C-a1, c1 in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). With temperatures increasing by 3.2, 4.0, 3.9, 6.5°C for RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s, the yield decreased significantly by 10, 15, 13 and 29% (Figure C-b1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The increases in precipitation resulted in a significant increase in wheat yields by about 10% (Figure C-c1 in
