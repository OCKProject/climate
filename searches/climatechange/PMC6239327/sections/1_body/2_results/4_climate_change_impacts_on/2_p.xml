<p class="p">Nitrate leaching increased dramatically with time from the beginning of the year to late June, and then leveled off from July to the end of the year at both locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). There was more nitrate leaching during the growing seasons at Swift Current and during the non-growing seasons at Woodslee (Figure G in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Soil nitrate leaching was about 6 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> at Swift Current, and 11 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> at Woodslee under the baseline scenario. Annual nitrate leaching increased by 1.1, 3.5, 4.4 and 7.7 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (19, 57, 73, 129%) at Swift Current and increased by 8, 12, 21 and 37 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (84, 117, 208, 317%) at Woodslee under RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s climate scenarios, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A2 and 2B2</xref>). Increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> did not impact soil nitrate leaching at either location (Figures E-a2 and F-a2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). However, increased temperatures resulted in large increases in soil nitrate leaching by 56, 68, 100, 119% at Swift Current and by 104, 146, 165, 415% at Woodslee under RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s climate scenarios, respectively (Figures E-b2 and F-b2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Increased precipitation only significantly impacted nitrate leaching under RCP8.5 2050s by 22% and under RCP8.5 2080s by 65% at Swift Current whereas the corresponding increases were 80% for RCP8.5 2050s and 51% for RCP8.5 2080s at Woodslee, (Figures E-c2 and F-c2 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>).
