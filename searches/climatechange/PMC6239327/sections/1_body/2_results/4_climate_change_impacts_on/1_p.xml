<p class="p">Compared to baseline scenarios, the average soil mineral N increased by 6, 15, 3, 5% at Swift Current and by 28, 32, 26, 101% at Woodslee under RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Soil mineral N was significantly affected by temperature (Figures E-b1 and F-b1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). In general, future elevated temperatures would significantly increase soil mineral N at both locations under future climate scenarios compared to the baseline scenario because high temperature resulted in higher residual N concentrations in the soil due to a lower yield and grain N uptake (Figures C and D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and precipitation decreased soil mineral N by about 21% and 27%, at Swift Current (Figure E-a1, c1 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>), because both of these factors increased wheat yields and N uptake of soil mineral N (Figures C and D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The reason for small increases in soil mineral N when all factors were combined at Swift Current was that the increased soil mineral N due to temperature increases was offset by the decreased soil mineral N resulting from elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations (i.e. increased yields and N uptake) and increasing precipitation (i.e. greater leaching) (Figure C-a4 in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0207370.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>).
