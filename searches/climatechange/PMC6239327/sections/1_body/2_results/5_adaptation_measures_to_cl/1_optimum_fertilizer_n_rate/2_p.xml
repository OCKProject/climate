<p class="p">At Woodslee, maize yields dramatically increased with an increased N application rate up to 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and maize yields levelled off when the FNR increased from 150 to 300 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for all scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A2</xref>). Based on our simulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>), the maximum maize yield of 7500 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> could be obtained at 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> under future RCP scenarios, while the maximum predicted maize yield of &gt;9000 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> could be achieved with 180–200 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> under baseline scenarios. On the other hand, simulated nitrate leaching increased exponentially at the higher N fertilizer rates of 150–300 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> because the crops could not utilize surplus fertilizer N in the soil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g003" class="xref">Fig 3B2</xref>). This illustrated that a FNR of 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is a reasonable fertilizer N application rate to achieve a balance between high maize yields comparatively low nitrate leaching estimates for both current and future climate conditions (
