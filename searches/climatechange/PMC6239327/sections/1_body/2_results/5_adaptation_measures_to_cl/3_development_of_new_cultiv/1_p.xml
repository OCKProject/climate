<p class="p">Sensitivity analysis for selected wheat cultivar parameters of PHINT and P5, and maize cultivar parameters of P1 and P5 were carried out in order to recommend a new cultivar with longer growing season to adapt to future RCP climate conditions. At Swift Current, Changing P5 parameter from 400 (default) to 600 degree days did not improve wheat yield (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A1</xref>). However, the wheat yield significantly increased with the increases of PHINT parameter. For example, under RCP8.5 2080s scenario, wheat yield increased from 2828 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (PHINT at default value of 65) to 3196 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (PHINT = 85 degree days) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A1</xref>), meanwhile soil nitrate leaching increased slightly (12.8 to 14.2 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A2</xref>), indicating that PHINT is a key parameter for adapting to climate change. Soil nitrate leaching fell below 15 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> across all scenarios (
