<p class="p">At Woodslee, maize yields increased from 6883 kg ha

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B1</xref>). Maize yield also increased significantly with the increases of P5 parameter for all future climate scenarios except RCP8.5 2080s scenario. For example, under RCP4.5 2050s scenario, maize yield increased from 6883 to 9860 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> when the P5 parameter changed from 890 (default) to 950 growing degree days (

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> under this scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B2</xref>). RCP8.5 2080s scenario showed the lowest yields with highest soil nitrate leaching among all scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207370.g005" class="xref">Fig 5A2 and 5B2</xref>). There was a trend for decreasing soil nitrate leaching when maize yields increased because new maize cultivars with high growing degree days could obtain greater yields and greater N uptake which would reduce surplus fertilizer N remaining in the soil at the end of the growing season (
