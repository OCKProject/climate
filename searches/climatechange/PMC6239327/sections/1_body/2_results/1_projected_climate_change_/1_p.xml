Compared to the baseline scenario, the projected changes for annual precipitation under RCP4.5 2050s, RCP4.5 2080s, RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s scenarios increased by 5.4, 10.7, 14.1, 21.3% at Swift Current and by 3.0, 2.3, 16.1, 11.4% at Woodslee (

The predicted growing season rainfall from May to August for wheat and from May to October for maize did not differ from the baseline scenario under RCP4.5 2050s and RCP4.5 2080s conditions, but it increased by 11.9, 10.5% at Swift Current and by 14.5, 4.6% at Woodslee under RCP8.5 2050s and RCP8.5 2080s climate scenarios, respectively. The average CO
