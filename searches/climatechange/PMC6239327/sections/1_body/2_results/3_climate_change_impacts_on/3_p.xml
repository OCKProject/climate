<p class="p">Comparing the present and future scenarios, the average soil water use efficiency (WUE, as defined by yield per unit of actual evapotranspiration) increased with increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations due to the decreased ET. In contrast, the WUE decreased with temperature due to the predicted decrease in yields. At Woodslee, when all factors were combined, WUE decreased significantly under future RCP climate scenarios because of the significant decreases in maize yields.
