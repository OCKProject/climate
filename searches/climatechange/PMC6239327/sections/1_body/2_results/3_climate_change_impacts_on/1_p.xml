 <xref rid="pone.0207370.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The mechanisms responsible for these decreases differed between the two sites a only evaporation (ES) decreased at Swift Current whereas only transpiration (EP) decreased at Woodslee (
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Based upon temperature increases alone, ET increased by an average of 7–12% at Swift Current, mainly due to the two-fold increase in ES values. ET also increased by from 7–13% at Woodslee which was due to the 14–20% increase in EP (
