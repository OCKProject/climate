<p class="p">The CSM-CERES-Wheat and CSM-CERES-Maize models were driven by the climate input under different climate scenarios. The results from different scenarios were expressed as percentage changes with respect to the baseline and as cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for spring wheat and maize yields. The nonparametric Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) test was also conducted to determine if the projection period CDFs differed significantly from the baseline CDF [
