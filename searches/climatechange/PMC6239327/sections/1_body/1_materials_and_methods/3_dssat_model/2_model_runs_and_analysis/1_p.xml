<p class="p">One baseline and four climate scenarios were generated and used for the modelling study, including (1) baseline 1971â€“2000; (2) RCP4.5 2050s; (3) RCP4.5 2080s; (4) RCP8.5 2050s and (5) RCP8.5 2080s. In order to investigate the impact of individual climatic variables from projected CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, temperature and precipitation, each future scenario was subdivided into four sub-scenarios: (a) using future CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> while keeping other climate variables at baseline values; (b) using future temperature while keeping other climate variables at baseline values; (c) using future precipitation while keeping other climate variables at baseline values; (d) using all variables from future scenarios. Therefore, the CSM-CERES-Wheat and -Maize models in DSSAT were run 1020 times (1 baseline and 4 scenarios by 4 sub-scenarios in a 30-years period) for climate scenario analysis at Swift Current, Saskatchewan and Woodslee, Ontario (Table C-a in
