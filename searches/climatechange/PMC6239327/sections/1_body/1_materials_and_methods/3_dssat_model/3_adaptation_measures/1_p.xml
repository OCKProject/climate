<p class="p">Cultivars with altered phenology, fertilizer N application rates and planting dates were simulated based on sensitivity analyses in order to explore adaptation measures to climate changes on crop yield and nitrate leaching, under baseline and future climate scenarios for spring wheat at Swift Current and maize at Woodslee. Therefore, the CSM- CERES- Wheat and -Maize models were run 7050 times for adaptation measures analysis at both locations (Table C-b in
