<p class="p">Two sites were selected in Western and Eastern Canada to include diverse climate conditions and cropping systems at the start of this study. The first site was a spring wheat experiment conducted at Swift Current, Saskatchewan (50°170’N, 107°480’W) in the Canadian semiarid temperate climatic zone. The average annual precipitation and temperature are 351 mm and 3.9°C respectively. The soil is an Orthic Brown Chernozem and the soil texture (0–0.15 m) is 50% silt and 20% clay [

The second site was a long-term maize cropping system in the Canadian humid-temperate climate at Woodslee, Ontario (42°13’N, 82°44’W) with an average annual precipitation of 843 mm and an average annual temperature of 9.3°C. The soil is a Brookston clay loam with an average soil texture (0–0.15m) of 35% silt and 37% clay [
