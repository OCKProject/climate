<p class="p">In this study, climate scenarios from the CanRCM4 model was used, thus the uncertainty associated with climate scenarios could be large based on the previous comparisons between global climate models or regional climate models [

The DSSAT model was calibrated and evaluated using long-term field experiments for spring wheat and maize. However, the lack of measured values for nitrate leaching at Swift Current and insufficient measurements of soil mineral and nitrate leaching at Woodslee contributed to the uncertainty in the model performance. In addition, initial soil parameters were set up for each scenario before the first year simulation, but certain soil physical properties such as hydraulic conductivity and water holding capacity were kept constant even though they may change under different climate conditions and management practices (e.g., fertilization, rotation, tillage) which could further impact crop yield and soil process. High crop production via crop residue inputs may increase carbon returns to soil but higher temperatures may also accelerate soil organic carbon decomposition [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Thus the net change in soil organic carbon levels can have a positive or negative impact on soil hydraulic properties which are not all captured in the current DSSAT model.
