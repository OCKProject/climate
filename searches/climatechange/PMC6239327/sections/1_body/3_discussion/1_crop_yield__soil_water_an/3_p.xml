<p class="p">More nitrate leaching occurred during the growing seasons at Swift Current and the non-growing seasons at Woodslee. These results were due to the differences in growing season lengths and timing (early May to late August for Swift Current and late May to early November for Woodslee) as well as the differences in quantities and patterns of precipitation between these two locations. At Swift Current, only about 150 mm (&lt;40%) of precipitation occurred in non-growing season, but for Woodslee, more than 400 mm (&gt;55%) of precipitation occurred in the non-growing season. Under future climate scenarios, nitrate leaching increased significantly compared to the baseline scenario at Woodslee which was mainly due to the future high temperature stress and increased precipitations that resulted in low crop N removal and increased drainage [
