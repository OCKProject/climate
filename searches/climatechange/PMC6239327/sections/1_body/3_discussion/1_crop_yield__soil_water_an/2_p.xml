<p class="p">The ET decreased with increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> alone at both locations under four climate scenarios. The reason for these differences is that elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can lead to a decrease in stomatal conductance which would result in lower ET values and increased leaf temperatures [
