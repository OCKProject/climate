<p class="p">In our study, climate change had a negative effect on maize yields and a positive effect on wheat yields without adaptation measures. Increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> resulted in a significant increase in spring wheat yields but less than 5% increase in maize yields because of the growth characteristics of the different 
 <bold class="bold">c</bold>rop types (e.g., wheat is a C3 crop and maize is a C4 crop). Hatfield et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] concluded that the doubling of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> would result in about a 30% increase in C3 crop yields, compared to a less than 10% increase for C4 crops. Similar results were reported by Thomson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] and Ko et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], where the increase in global mean temperature had a negative effect on crop yields, which was partially offset by the positive impact of increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and precipitation. In addition, Ben-Asher et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] found that photosynthetic rate declined for each 1°C increase in temperatures above 30°C. In the CERES-Maize, and -Wheat models, the rate of development is governed by thermal time or growing degree-days (GDD), which is computed based on the daily maximum and minimum temperatures and base temperature for root growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. For example, the GDD from maize germination to emergence (P9) is calculated from seed depth (SDEPTH, cm) by P9 = 45.0 + GDDE × SDEPTH, where GDDE is an ecotype parameter that GDD per cm seed depth required for emergence [
