<p class="p">Compared to the baseline cultivars, the wheat yield of new cultivar increased with the increased PHINT whereas maize yield increased with the parameters of P1 and P5. Thus development of new cultivars indicated that long growing season with higher thermal degree days are required to adapting to climate change in the future. This result was consistent with previous modelling studies using the RCP or SRES scenarios for winter wheat and maize. Future increased temperature conditions were found to require longer growing season cultivars to reach crop maturity for obtaining high yields and reduce environmental risks [
