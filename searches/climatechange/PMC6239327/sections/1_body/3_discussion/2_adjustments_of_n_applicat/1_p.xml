<p class="p">Fertilizer N rate will be expected to change under future climate to optimize crop yield due to changes in precipitation patterns, temperature and extreme weather events [

 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Our results indicated that the optimal spring wheat yields were achieved at higher fertilizer N rates (80 to 100 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) compared to the insufficient fertilizer N rate under both baseline and future climate conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0207370.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. At Woodslee, simulated nitrate leaching increased significantly when fertilizer N rates were greater than 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> as maize yields did not respond to additional N fertilizer inputs above this rate and there would be surplus fertilizer N in the soil which could be lost by leaching. Therefore, the 150 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>fertilizer N rate is recommended to apply for obtaining high maize yields with comparatively low nitrate leaching for both baseline and future climate scenarios.
