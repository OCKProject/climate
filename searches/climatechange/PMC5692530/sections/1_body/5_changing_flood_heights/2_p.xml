<p class="p">To estimate the effect of SLR on flood heights in NYC in 2100 and 2300, we combined the peak storm-surge height for each synthetic storm from the core models with samples of projected SLR for 2080–2100 and 2280–2300 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sfig08" class="xref">Fig. S8</xref>). For both RCP4.5 and 8.5 we consider two future SLR probability distributions. First, we employ probabilistic representations of ice-sheet mass loss, glacier mass loss, global mean thermal expansion, regional ocean dynamics, land water storage, and nonclimatic background processes from ref. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> and extend those projections to 2300. Static-equilibrium fingerprints are used to translate changes in ice masses to local relative SLR. Second, we replace the AIS projections of ref. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> with a small ensemble generated by ref. 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, incorporating marine ice-sheet instability, ice-cliff collapse, and ice-shelf hydrofracturing mechanisms (
