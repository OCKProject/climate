<p class="p">Beyond the limitations of GCMs, it should also be noted that, like many previous studies (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>), we do not consider the extratropical transition of storms as they move to higher latitudes. The extratropical transition of TCs that impact the northeastern United States is not uncommon (
 <xref rid="r46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>) and can result in storms such as Hurricane Sandy (2012), which generated devastating surges in NYC as a posttropical cyclone. Sediment records of coastal flooding near NYC support the idea that the frequency of major flood events may be underestimated in GCM studies (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>).
