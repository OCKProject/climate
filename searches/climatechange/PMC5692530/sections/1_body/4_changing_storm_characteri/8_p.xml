Monthly mean SLP differences between the latter portions of the modern (1980–2000) and future (2080–2100) time periods during the months of August and September indicate future SLPs that are slightly higher (∼300 Pa) over the Atlantic coast of the United States and slightly lower (∼200 Pa) over the North Atlantic in the future (
