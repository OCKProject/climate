<p class="p">Projections from the four additional models are generally consistent with those from the core models. For example, the additional models also show an increase in the density of offshore tracks near NYC in 2080–2100 compared with 1980–2000, with the largest increases in densities occurring between ∼39–42 °N and ∼67–72 °W (
