<p class="p">We first consider storm surge alone, which neglects the contribution of SLR to flood heights. Storm-surge return periods at the Battery tide gauge in NYC reveal either little change (CCSM4, IPSL to 2100), or slightly increased return periods (MPI, IPSL to 2300) between modern and future time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). For example, the 1,000-y storm surge in the IPSL model decreases from 1.8 m during 1970–2005 to 1.6 m during 2010–2300. This result differs from some previous studies of New York storm surge using CMIP3 models, which show a significant decrease of storm-surge return periods over the 21st century, mainly because of an increase of storm frequency and/or intensity (
