<p class="p">Principal component analysis (PCA) shows that modern and future storm surges are strongly impacted by TC radius of maximum wind (RMW) values, similar to preindustrial-era results (850â€“1800; ref. 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). Level amplification factors (LAFs) of modern return periods of RMW for the CCSM4 and IPSL models suggest larger RMW values in the future (

 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>. Larger RMW values may lead to higher wind speeds at fixed points from the storm center, which may lead to larger storm surges.
