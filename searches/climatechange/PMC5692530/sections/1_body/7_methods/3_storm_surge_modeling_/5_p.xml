<p class="p">Ref. 
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref> shows that, especially for SLR amounts of about 1.8 m or less, the nonlinear effect of SLR on storm-surge heights at the Battery is very small; ref. 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref> also demonstrates similar flood levels at the Battery for both static and dynamically modeled floods of up to about 5.8 m. However, while such a linear combination of surge and SLR may provide a close approximation, it may also result in a slight underestimation of final flood heights (
 <xref rid="r58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>), which could cause some of the flood heights presented here to be somewhat lower than what we would expect if SLR were fully integrated into ADCIRC.
