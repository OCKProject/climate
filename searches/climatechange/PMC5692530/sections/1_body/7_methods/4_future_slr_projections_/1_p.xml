<p class="p">For the future mean sea levels upon which simulated storm-surge events occur, we use 10,000 Monte Carlo (MC) samples of projected sea level at the Battery for both the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, based upon the framework of ref. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>. SLR projections are developed based on the CMIP5 archive for thermal expansion and ocean dynamics, surface-mass balance modeling for glacier melt, a combination of the AR5 expert assessment and the expert elicitation of ref. 
 <xref rid="r60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref> for ice-sheet contributions, semiempirical modeling of land water storage, statistical modeling of nonclimatic local sea-level change, and geophysical modeling of gravitational, elastic, and rotational effects on local sea level (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). We also generated a set of projections in which we replaced the west and east AIS projections of ref. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> with random samples from the 5- to 20-m Pliocene, non-bias-adjusted RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ensembles of ref. 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>. It should be noted that ref. 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> was not attempting to construct a probability distribution of future AIS changes; its ensemble of 29 members can be viewed neither as spanning the full range of possibilities with minimal gaps nor as having a defined probability associated with each member. Thus, the distribution of this second set of projections may be viewed as a frequency distribution from a modeled set of possible futures, but not as a probability distribution of future SLR (
