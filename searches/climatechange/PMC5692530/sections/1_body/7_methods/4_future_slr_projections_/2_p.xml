<p class="p">The projections used here differ from those of refs. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref> in two important ways. First, the projections are extended to 2300, while those of ref. 
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref> ended in 2200. For the ocean dynamic and thermal expansion components we achieve this extension by continuing to use GCM projections that extend to 2300. For glacier projections we do the same using surface-mass balance projections driven by GCM projections extending to 2300. For the Greenland ice sheet and for AIS in the ensemble consistent with AR5 we continue the linear growth of ice-sheet melt rates beyond 2200. Second, for the ensemble employing the AIS projections (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>), we employ the full time series of projections; only 2100 and 2500 values are reported in ref. 
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>.
