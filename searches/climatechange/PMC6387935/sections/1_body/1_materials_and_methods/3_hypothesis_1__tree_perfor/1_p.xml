<p class="p">Thirty-two medium and 32 small trees in each of the replicate sites (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) within an area/soil-type were selected haphazardly by finding interspersed trees meeting height and basal trunk diameter requirements for small and medium categories of trees. Most trees were selected in 1995, but a few more trees were added through 1999 to account for tree mortality if there were suitably sized trees available within the sub-site. Small trees had mean basal trunk diameter (±1 SE) of 6.42 cm (±0.08) and medium trees had basal trunk diameter of 15.25 cm (±0.17) at the start of the study. 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the locations of replicate sites within areas that make up the nested geographic design. This design increased the generality of the comparison across areas with contrasting soils type by increasing spatial representation. Total sample sizes were: area one = 373, area two = 191, area three = 193 (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Stem growth was measured for years 1986–2007. We counted male strobili clusters on each tree from year 1995–2008.
