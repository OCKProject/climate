<p class="p">All three study areas are woodlands dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">P. edulis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus monosperma</italic>. Study area one is near Sunset Crater National Monument on the cinder field associated with an ∼1000 years old volcanic eruption (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This area has coarse-textured soils with low water holding capacity and is represented by six sub-sites while study areas two and three have finer-textured soils with greater water holding capacity and are represented by three sub-sites each (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Miller et al., 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Selmants and Hart, 2008</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Cinder soils of area one have lower nutrient levels of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium, copper, and manganese compared to soils developed on limestone and sandstone substrates (area two) (

 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Swaty et al., 1998</xref>). Other studies have also shown the young, cinder soils to be lower in phosphate, soil moisture, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> mineralization, and NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> mineralization (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gehring and Whitham, 1994</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). Additional studies comparing area one to area three, which is a much older volcanic-substrate soil, also found area one to be lower in clay, nitrogen, carbon, and soil water (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Selmants and Hart, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Selmants and Hart, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Looney et al., 2012</xref>). Area three is lower than area one in plant available forms of phosphorus, as would be predicted for an older, versus younger, volcanic soil (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Selmants and Hart, 2010</xref>). Because of generally lower nutrient status and low water holding capacity, trees growing in the cinder soils of area one experience more stressful abiotic conditions. The trees at the young cinder soil sites c,d (see 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) of area one exhibit higher incidence of susceptibility to the stem-boring moth (
 <italic class="italic">D. albovittella</italic>) and studies of moth susceptible and resistant trees in these areas began in the 1980’s (see references under H2 and H3 sections below) hence hypotheses H2 and H3 will be addressed with trees from area one only. Annual stem growth measures are available starting with year 1986, strobili counts starting in year 1995, and moth killed stems (H3 only) starting in year 1982.
