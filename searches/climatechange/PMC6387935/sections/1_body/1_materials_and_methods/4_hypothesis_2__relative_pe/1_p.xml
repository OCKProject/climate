<p class="p">At the main cinder soil study area, 25 moth resistant and 25 susceptible trees were chosen for long-term monitoring and have been reported on previously (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cobb et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gehring et al., 2017</xref>). The trees are closely matched in age and basal trunk diameter, and the height difference reflects the tree versus shrub architecture that results from moth herbivory (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cobb et al., 2002</xref>). Linear models found significant differences among tree groups only for height and not for basal trunk diameter or age. Moth resistant trees had basal trunk diameters of mean = 20.3 cm (
