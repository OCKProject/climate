<p class="p">Differential herbivory also can contribute to differences in tree performance under drought conditions. Drought interacts with insect herbivory by altering plant defenses, influencing water and nutrient content of plant tissues, and altering chemical cues used by insects to identify hosts (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Allen et al., 2010</xref>), drought can also reduce resource quality for herbivores, resulting in herbivore population declines (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kolb et al., 2016a</xref>). Insect herbivores also can be affected directly by the high temperatures often associated with summer drought. For example, warm temperatures combine with drought-stressed susceptible hosts increase bark beetle populations to epidemic levels (
