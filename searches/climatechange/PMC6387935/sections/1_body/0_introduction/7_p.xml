 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meddens et al. (2015)</xref> developed a conceptual framework describing how soil, climate, abiotic agents, and tree attributes relate to 
 <italic class="italic">P. edulis</italic> mortality via the physiological mechanisms that contribute to mortality. We follow that framework in the development of our hypotheses. Our overarching hypothesis is similar to that of 
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meddens et al. (2015)</xref> in that we propose that the negative impacts on 
 <italic class="italic">P. edulis</italic> of growing in poor soil (an abiotic stressor), and experiencing chronic herbivory (a biotic stressor), would be compounded by severe drought. The hypotheses we describe were developed when our monitoring program began in the 1980’s and 1990’s, before some contradictory observations had been made (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gehring et al., 2017</xref>). We use long-term data on mortality, stem growth, male reproduction, and moth herbivory of 
 <italic class="italic">P. edulis</italic> trees at areas in northern Arizona to test the following hypotheses: (H1) trees growing in shallow, nutrient-poor, coarse-textured soil with low water holding capacity will suffer greater declines in performance than trees in areas with deeper, higher nutrient, fine-textured soil with higher water holding capacity under drought conditions; (H2) trees experiencing chronic moth herbivory would suffer compounded declines in performance due to drought compared to herbivore resistant trees. We also examine long-term trends in levels of moth herbivory to test the hypothesis that moth herbivory would increase as trees experienced greater drought (H3). We expected moth herbivory to increase with drought stress because 
 <italic class="italic">D. albovittella</italic> is more abundant in stressful sites with shallow, coarse-textured, nutrient-poor soils (
