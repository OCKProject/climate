 <italic class="italic">Larix decidua</italic> (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">George et al., 2017</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus sylvestris</italic> (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taeger et al., 2013</xref>) revealed significant differences among provenances in a treeâ€™s capacity to both withstand drought and to reach pre-drought growth levels after drought. Similarly, intraspecific variation in Norway spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>) explained up to 44% of the phenotypic variation in drought response (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Trujillo-Moya et al., 2018</xref>). Many studies demonstrating the importance of intraspecific genetic variation in drought response compare individuals of widely distributed plant species that occupy markedly different environments. It is less clear how intraspecific genetic differences contribute to the variable levels of mortality observed among trees occupying the same or similar sites.
