<p class="p">Heightened drought severity and warming temperatures due to climate change have contributed to world-wide increases in tree mortality (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McDowell et al., 2018</xref>). Physiological drivers of mortality include hydraulic failure and carbon starvation (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jump et al., 2017</xref>). Herbivorous insects and fungal pathogens can exacerbate drought impacts on trees (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Olano et al., 2015</xref>), and trees that live and die following severe drought often grow side by side (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderegg et al., 2015b</xref>), understory community composition (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kane et al., 2011</xref>), and community interactions (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gilman et al., 2010</xref>), it is critical to understand the factors that contribute to variation in tree mortality. It is equally important to understand how surviving trees and their pests respond following drought to better predict the future of forested ecosystems.
