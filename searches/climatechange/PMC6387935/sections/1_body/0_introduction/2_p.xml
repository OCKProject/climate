<p class="p">The impacts of drought on trees may differ across the landscape due to differences among sites in soil texture and water holding capacity. Mortality of trees was associated with low water holding capacity due to a combination of soil depth and texture in the semi-arid southwestern United States (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterman et al., 2013</xref>). Stands with hotter, drier climates and low soil available water capacity showed limited regeneration following drought-related tree mortality (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Redmond et al., 2015</xref>). However, soil texture did not influence tree mortality following severe drought in the Amazon Basin (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williamson et al., 2000</xref>). Also, the effects of soil properties may vary temporally as the precipitation regime changes. The inverse texture hypothesis (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Noy-Meir, 1973</xref>) proposes that plants growing in coarse-textured soil experience less water stress than plants growing in fine-textured soil and 
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sala et al. (1989)</xref> suggested this soil texture effect differed with annual precipitation. Longer-term data on tree performance at sites that differ in soil properties and that include drought and non-drought years could help reconcile conflicting patterns.
