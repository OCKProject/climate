<p class="p">Also in contrast to hypothesis 1, mortality was not greater for area one (cinder soils) in comparison to the other areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), but instead was either significantly lower or similar. The binomial model of mortality shows that area one had a significantly lower proportion dead (0.30) than area two (0.63, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.00186). We were not able to distinguish the proportion dead at area three (0.48) from area one (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.14036). Lack of statistical power for this test limits interpretation for area three relative to area one, but it is unlikely that the true mortality is higher for area one.
