<p class="p">We hypothesized that trees growing at areas determined to be abiotically stressful due to coarse soil texture and low water holding capability before drought would suffer the greatest declines in performance as measured by stem growth, male strobili production, and mortality, but instead observed the opposite patterns. Trees in the coarse soil area (area one), did not suffer greater loss of performance during drought than the other areas (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows the actual data and a rough correspondence between SPEI and performance measures, it does not show the full extent of the relationship (slope) between drought and stem growth because it does not account for the time series aspects of the data that are incorporated in the model. For area one, there was a significant, but small, positive slope for the relationship between stem growth and SPEI (slope = 0.66, SE = 0.10, slope different from 0: 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) so stem growth decreased slightly with increased drought. The other two areas had significantly greater slopes of the relationship between stem growth and SPEI when compared to area one (area two slope = 3.13, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001 and area three slope = 2.18, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3A</xref>). These regression results indicate a lower responsiveness of growth to drought in area one (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3A</xref>). Taken together, these results show that trees in area one respond less to drought than expected.
