<p class="p">We hypothesized that moth susceptible trees suffering chronic herbivory before drought would suffer the greatest declines in performance during drought. However, two lines of evidence show the opposite result or are inconsistent with this hypothesis. First, the stem growth of moth resistant trees was more negatively affected by drought than the stem growth of moth susceptible trees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Moth resistant trees had a significant positive relationship between stem growth and SPEI (slope = 3.34, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5A</xref>) meaning that stem growth declined with increasing drought stress. The slope of the SPEI regression for moth susceptible trees is much less (slope = 1.13, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.0002 for contrast with resistant tree slope, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5A</xref>). This analysis supports the finding of a smaller decline in stem growth for moth susceptible trees with drought (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>) than moth resistant trees. Moth resistant trees had a significant positive relationship between male strobili counts and SPEI (slope = 0.551, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Poisson link function, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref>) meaning that male strobili counts declined with increasing drought stress. Moth susceptible trees, however, had a smaller slope for the relationship with SPEI (slope = 0.225, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; Poisson link function, 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref>), suggesting that male function in susceptible trees was less affected by drought than resistant trees.
