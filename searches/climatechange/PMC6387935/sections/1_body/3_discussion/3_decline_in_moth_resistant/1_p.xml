<p class="p">Previous work on the stem-boring moth and its interactions with pinyon pine has shown that this herbivore decreased trunk and branch growth of pinyon pine by âˆ¼45% and shifted reproductive allocation away from female cones and toward male strobili (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gehring et al., 2017</xref>), has been accumulating since the start of the monitoring program described here that contradicts H2. Our long-term observations of tree growth through time also indicates that moth resistant trees are less tolerant of long-term drought than moth susceptible trees suggesting tradeoffs in which moth resistant trees perform best under normal conditions, but susceptible trees perform best during drought conditions.
