<p class="p">Our findings that male reproduction was negatively affected by drought supports other research documenting the potential sensitivity of pinyon pine reproduction to climate change. Cone production has declined broadly across the landscape (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Redmond et al., 2012</xref>) and pollen germination is impaired by the temperatures that 
 <italic class="italic">P. edulis</italic> is predicted to experience as climate changes (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Flores-Renteria et al., 2018</xref>). In this long-term study, we also saw declines in the production of male strobili with drought. While sporadic reproduction and repeated measures on trees experiencing mortality obscure these trends in the raw data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1C</xref>) the analysis in 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3B</xref> supports male strobili declines with drought. Areas one and two show differential responses in strobili production to drought with area one responding less to drought stress and area two responding more (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3B</xref>). Strobili production was of intermediate responsiveness to drought at area three which means strobili did not follow exactly the same pattern as stem growth. Area three has older, volcanic substrate soil that is relatively low in phosphorus (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Selmants and Hart, 2010</xref>). Because lower phosphorus has been associated with lower allocation to male reproduction (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lau and Stephenson, 1994</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fujita et al., 2014</xref>) this might be an area to pursue in future studies of pinyon allocation to growth versus male reproduction.
