SPEI for the strobili count analysis is different from the one used for stem measures as it is based on the 12 months prior to pollen production in May. Area one is the stressful, coarse soil site. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Annual stem length growth mean ± SE for the three areas. The coefficients provided are the slopes of the stem growth relationship to SPEI from the mixed model ARMA analysis in 
   <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3A</xref> and the 
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>-values are tests of significant difference between the area one slope versus areas two and three.
