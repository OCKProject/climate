<p id="p0030" class="p">We agree with our colleagues' assessment that climate change may be contributing to the increasing incidence of coccidioidomycosis. The organism thrives in arid environments, and during prolonged droughts, its spore form enables it to outcompete local bacterial populations. In California, climate change is projected to lead to prolonged droughts and decreased snowpack in the Sierra Nevada and therefore lower soil moisture. After earthquakes or heavy rainfall, coccidioidomycosis epidemics may become an increasing threat to public health.</p>
