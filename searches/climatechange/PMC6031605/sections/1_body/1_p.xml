<p id="p0015" class="p">At the University of California San Francisco, we also experienced an unusually high incidence of coccidioidomycosis in late 2016. Last November, we saw 2 patients from the Central Valley with a recent history of immunosuppression. The first was a 64-year-old man 8 months after a liver transplant who presented after not responding to empiric treatment for community-acquired pneumonia, manifesting as cough, fevers, and hypoxemia. We were consulted for erythematous papulonodules with central umbilication and necrosis (
