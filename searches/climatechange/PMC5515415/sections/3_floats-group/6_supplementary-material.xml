  <title class="title">Schematic representation of the pathways discussed in this research for the genes involved in energy metabolism.</title>
  <p class="p">Doted arrows indicate gene expression regulation from the source to the sink gene; dashed arrows represent a source gene that encodes a protein is responsible for substrate conversion; and full arrows indicate a direct conversion. Target genes are represented with squares, except for 
   <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> (represented with a rectangle with two curved sides), which is a key gene in the regulation of many gene involved in these pathways. Circles indicate genes which regulate relevant pathways but that are not target genes and polygons symbolize the substrates.
