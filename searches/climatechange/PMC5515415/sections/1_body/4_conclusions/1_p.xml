<p class="p">Climate change projections for freshwater ecosystems are scarce and may be worse than we simulated here, particularly for the acidification of these ecosystems, where organic matter content may be extremely variable between water bodies and seasons, contrary to what is observed in oceanic waters [

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In this study, we examined differences in protein configuration and in gene expression between two endemic Iberian freshwater fish species that inhabit different climatic regions, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> in the Atlantic-type northern region and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> in the Mediterranean-type southwestern region. We observed protein structural differences between the two species for HSC70, FKBP52 and HIF1Î± and higher thermostability for HSP90 and GBP1 in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>. Most of the changes in gene expression were observed for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic>, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> showed no major changes in the heat shock response or in respiratory capacity. Taken together, these results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>, which lives in a warmer environment, is less impacted by temperature increases and acidification. Consequently, our results suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> could be capable of dealing with the IPCC projections of warming and/or acidification at the end of this century. Our study highlights the importance of assessing the potential of endangered freshwater species to cope with projected climate change conditions for the proper implementation of conservation strategies.
