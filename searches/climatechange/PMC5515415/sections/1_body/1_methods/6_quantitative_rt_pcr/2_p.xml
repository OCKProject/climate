<p class="p">Real-time polymerase chain (PCR) reactions were performed in a Bio-Rad CFX96 system (Bio-Rad, USA), following manufacturer’s instructions for Sso Advanced universal SYBR® Green supermix (Bio- Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Controls without template and without reverse transcriptase were included to check for PCR contamination and genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) contamination, respectively. Amplicons identities were confirmed through melting curve analysis. The PCR efficiency for each sample was assessed using LinRegPCR 11.1 software [

Relative quantity of genes of interest was calculated, using the comparative threshold cycle (CT) method with efficiency correction, using the mean PCR efficiency for each amplicon [
