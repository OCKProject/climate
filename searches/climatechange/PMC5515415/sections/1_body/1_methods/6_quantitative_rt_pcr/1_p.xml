<p class="p">Relative expression levels of genes of interest were normalized against three reference genes [Poly(A) binding protein, cytoplasmic 1a (
 <italic class="italic">pabpc1a</italic>), ribosomal protein L35 (
 <italic class="italic">rpl35</italic>) and ribosomal protein SA (
 <italic class="italic">rpsa</italic>)] (for details on primer conditions see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s005" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>, supporting information), chosen among the most stable genes for the transcriptomes of three organs (liver, fins and skeletal muscle) of these two species exposed to different temperature conditions (18°C and 30°C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. These reference genes were chosen from contigs with more than 1000 read counts per library, FDR &gt; 0.05 and Fold Change &lt; 1.5 (log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>(Fold Change) &lt; 0.58), in order to assure that they are highly expressed, but not differentially expressed. Furthermore, reference genes stability was also verified in 
 <italic class="italic">Squalius pyrenaicus</italic> transcriptome [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], to further guarantee their stability across more conditions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s006" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>, supporting information). In order to determine the stability of these reference genes, in the qPCR analysis, we used the NormFinder software [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>].
