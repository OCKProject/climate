<p class="p">Data was log transformed [log10(x+1)] and checked for normality (Shapiro-Wilk’s test) and homoscedasticity (Levene’s test). A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to identify statistical differences in transcript expression patterns across the experimental conditions for all genes independently, for each tissue. Post-hoc tests for multiple comparisons (Tukey tests) were applied whenever significant differences across treatments were observed. All statistical analyses were performed using a significance level of 0.05, using a custom python script and the program STATISTICA v.12 (StatSoft Inc., USA).</p>
