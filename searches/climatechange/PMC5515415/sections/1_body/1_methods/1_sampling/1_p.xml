 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> species were collected from Portuguese rivers, Mondego (40° 8'5.22"N; 8° 8'35.06"W) and Mira (37°38'1.31"N; 8°37'22.37"W), respectively, by electro-fishing (300V, 4A). Short duration pulses were used in order to avoid juvenile mortality. Sampling was performed during spring season (when average water temperatures were 17.8 +- 0.67°C for Mondego river and 19.5 +- 0.21°C for Mira river and average water pH were 8.08 +- 0.01 for Mondego river and 8.23 +- 0.02 for Mira river). Fish were captured under a license (263/2014/CAPT) issued by Portuguese authority for Conservation of endangered species (ICNF [Instituto da Conservação da Natureza e das Florestas]).
