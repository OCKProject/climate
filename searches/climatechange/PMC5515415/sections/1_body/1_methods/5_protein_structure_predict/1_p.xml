<p class="p">In order to predict physical and chemical parameters, the ProtParam tool [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] was used. Protein three-dimensional structure was also predicted using the homology modelling algorithm (RaptorX Structure Prediction) offered in RaptorX webserver [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Protein structural alignments of each species were performed following the Smith-Waterman algorithm offered in UCSF Chimera [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], using the default parameters with a secondary structure score set to 0.70. Protein alignments were performed using the same protein of each species and differences are presented, with differing amino acid residues highlighted.
