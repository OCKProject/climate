<p class="p">Liver and muscle tissue samples were immediately collected from fish and stored using RNAlater (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For ribonucleic acid (RNA) extraction, TRI Reagent (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was added to liver and muscle samples. After homogenization with a Tissue Ruptor (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), RNA was extracted according to the TRI Reagent manufacturers protocol. TURBO DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) was employed to degrade any remaining genomic contaminants, followed by phenol/chloroform purification and LiCl precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Sample quality was checked using a Nanodrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) based on the 260/280 nm and 260/230 nm absorbance ratios. Sample concentration were determined to ensure sufficient quantity of homogeneous RNA for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. Synthesis of cDNA was performed, according to manufacturer’s instructions, using a RevertAid H Minus First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and stored subsequently at -20°C.
