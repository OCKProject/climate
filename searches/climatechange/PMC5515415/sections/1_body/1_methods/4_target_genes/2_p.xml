<p class="p">For both species, the sequences of the target genes were obtained from Genomic Resources Development Consortium 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. All pairs of primers used were designed using PerlPrimer software v.1.1.19 [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s004" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s005" class="xref">S2</xref> Tables, supporting information). Sequences that displayed polymorphisms between both species were re-sequenced by Sanger (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s004" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>, supporting information). CLC Sequence Viewer v7.5 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) was employed to align nucleotide sequences. Complete sequences were obtained, except for 
 <italic class="italic">per1a</italic> gene for which transcriptome information only permitted to study the partial coding sequence. The obtained sequences were deposited in GenBank (Accession numbers: KX589462-KX589485). Nucleotide sequences were translated and the resulting protein sequences were aligned using CLC Sequence Viewer v7.5 (CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) under default parameters (gap open cost: 10; gap extension cost: 1; end gap cost: as any other; and alignment method very accurate).
