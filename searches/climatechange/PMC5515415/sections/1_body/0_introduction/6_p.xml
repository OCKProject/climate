<p class="p">Here, we aim to understand how freshwater fish might respond to projected future climate change scenarios of warming and acidification and their combined effects. We studied two Iberian endemic fish, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>. Both species have distinct evolutionary backgrounds and experience differing environmental conditions. We simulated a climate change scenario for the year 2100, consisting of a summer average temperature increase of 3°C and a ΔpH = -0.4. Therefore, we based our parameters on the IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RPC 8.5) from the fifth Assessment Report (AR5) [

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], since it projects an increase of air temperature ranging from 2.6 to 4.8 and an increase in oceanic water acidification of ΔpH = -0.42. In this context, we investigated fourteen genes linked to warming and/or water acidification responses in fish, taking advantage of their differential expression in the transcriptomes of

 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> and

 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Specifically, we used genes involved in protein folding, energy metabolism, circadian rhythms and immune responses in order to: i) compare the differences between the two species protein structural and functional configurations, and ii) assess alterations in gene expression between control and experimental conditions. Integration of our results allowed us to evaluate the potential capacity of the endemic freshwater fish to cope with future climate change scenarios.
