 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], and freshwater fish often have limited ability to migrate to a more suitable river, making them vulnerable to environmental changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Evidence of coping mechanisms for climate change are emerging for teleost fish species such as chinook and sockeye salmon (

 <italic class="italic">O</italic>.

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Also, the reef fish 
 <italic class="italic">Acanthochromis polyacanthus</italic> and the rainbowfish 
 <italic class="italic">Melanotaenia duboulayi</italic> have exhibited changes in gene expression in response to warming, both through plasticity mechanisms and processes that may enable them to adjust over generations [
