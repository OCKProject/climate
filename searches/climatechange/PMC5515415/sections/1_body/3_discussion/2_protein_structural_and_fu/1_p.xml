<p class="p">First, we consider at the structural and functional evolution of 14 proteins in two Iberian endemic fish species (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> from the North and 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> from the South). Of the 14 predicted proteins we studied, 3 proteins related to protein folding presented noticeable differences between species in either their physical and chemical parameters (HSP90) or in their structure (HSC70, FKBP52). Additionally, structural differences were found for the energy metabolism-related protein, HIF1Î±, and both functional and structural differences were found for GBP1, which is involved in the immune response.
