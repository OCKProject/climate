 <italic class="italic">fkbp4</italic> gene encodes FK506-binding protein 4 (FKBP52), which possesses an N-terminal peptidylprolyl cis–trans isomerase domain (PPIase) and a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR). The PPIase domain is responsible for the cis-trans isomerization process that can limit this type of protein folding [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], whereas the TPR domain mediates protein–protein interactions. For example, FKBP52 interacts with HSP90, thereby facilitating the intracellular trafficking of steroid receptors. Moreover, this protein is involved in the regulation of interferon regulatory factor-4 and plays an important role in immunoregulatory gene expression in B and T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Here, we observed alterations in both domains, suggesting that this protein has a potential role in climate change adaptation in these species. HIF1α is responsible for regulating many hypoxia-associated genes, as well as genes involved in glucose metabolism, cell proliferation and iron metabolism. Our predicted HIF1α proteins showed differences in all three functional domains, particularly in the DNA-binding domain that is crucial for the regulation of transcription [

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], which may be a key element in the regulatory activity of proteins such as enzymes, ion channels, receptors and transcription factors [
