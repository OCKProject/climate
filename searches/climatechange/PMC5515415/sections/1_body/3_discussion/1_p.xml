<p class="p">It is currently assumed that climate change, namely warming and acidification, will pose serious challenges to species survival and persistence [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. In general, temperate species are potentially more adapted to deal with wide ranges of temperatures and pH on a seasonal and daily basis. To date, empirical data on the biological effects of warming and acidification on freshwater biota, especially endangered fish species, is scarce or still poorly understood [

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. To the best of our knowledge, our work represents the first comparative study integrating protein structural and functional analysis and gene expression changes in freshwater fish species exposed to experimental conditions of warming and acidification, simulating a future climate change scenario.
