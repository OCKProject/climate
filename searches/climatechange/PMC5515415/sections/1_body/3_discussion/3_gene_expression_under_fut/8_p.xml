<p class="p">Warming and acidification have impacts on many biological processes that occur in vertebrate cells. Despite limited evidence that circadian clock genes may be directly impacted by climate change, temperature may trigger the responses of such genes [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], as observed for the species in this study [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. We found that the two circadian clock genes we studied, 
 <italic class="italic">cry1aa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">per1a</italic>, presented significant changes under both warming and acidification conditions. Expression was increased for 
 <italic class="italic">cry1aa</italic> and decreased for 
 <italic class="italic">per1a</italic> in both species. The 
 <italic class="italic">cry1aa</italic> gene is known to be induced in fish during the early morning, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">per1a</italic> has higher expression late at night (end of the dark period) [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Contrary to 
 <italic class="italic">cry1aa</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">per1a</italic> gene does not exhibit light-dependent expression [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Therefore, disruption of this balance in the circadian clock of fish may have profound effects on fish metabolism and behavior (such as feeding and mating behavior), particularly given that the changes were not the result of experimental changes in photoperiod. For a more detailed mechanistic explanation on this subject, a study of all genes involved in the circadian clock would aid our understanding of the regulation of the pool of 
 <italic class="italic">cry</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">per</italic> genes that are involved in clock regulation.
