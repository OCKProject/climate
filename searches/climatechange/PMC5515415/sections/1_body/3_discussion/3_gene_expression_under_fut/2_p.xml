<p class="p">Across all experimental conditions, genes involved in protein folding presented differential expression only for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic>, with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">stip1</italic> that showed changes in both species. The heat shock proteins 
 <italic class="italic">hsc70</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">hsp90aa1</italic> presented changes in quantitative gene expression for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic>, but 
 <italic class="italic">hsp70</italic> did not. The differences in gene expression found for 
 <italic class="italic">hsc70</italic>, support that structural differences between the two species can be important to protein function. Long-term changes in these genes may be disadvantageous since previous studies have shown that resources are reallocated from other crucial biological processes (e.g. growth) for the folding of denatured proteins [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In previous studies, heat shock induced increased expression of both 
 <italic class="italic">hsp70</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">hsc70</italic> as a response to acute thermal stress in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], probably to prevent protein denaturation [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. However, in the present study, no change was observed for 
 <italic class="italic">hsp</italic> genes in response to a milder temperature change for a longer period. Therefore, the fact that 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> have specific changes in protein structure at these genes, together with the fact that it coped with the new environment without major changes in the gene expression might indicate that this species has a higher thermal tolerance before eliciting stress responses.
