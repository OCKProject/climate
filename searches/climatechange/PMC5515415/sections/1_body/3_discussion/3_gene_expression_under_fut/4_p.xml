<p class="p">The genes involved in energy metabolism presented an intricate and interconnected response (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>, supporting information for a schematic representation). The transcription factor 
 <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> induces many genes during hypoxia, but also participates in other pathways such as glucose metabolism, with 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> being a target gene of this transcription factor [

 <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> genes was observed in liver. Thus, the induction of 
 <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> gene expression seems to be more related to glucose metabolism rather than hypoxia. Importantly, the liver is capable of catabolism and anabolism at the same time; an ability not shared by any other organ or tissue [
