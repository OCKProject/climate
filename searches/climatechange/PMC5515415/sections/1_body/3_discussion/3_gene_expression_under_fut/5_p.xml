<p class="p">However, gluconeogenesis is an expensive mechanism and we found that upregulation of the 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> gene was coupled with an increase in 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> transcription, suggesting an increase in the usage of pyruvate by the citric acid cycle. Furthermore, in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> expression in muscle was not altered between treatments, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> was upregulated under acidic and combined conditions, suggesting a greater ability to produce ATP. However, 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> exhibited downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> under the same conditions, with no significant change in 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> transcription, so perhaps this species has a reduced capacity to produce ATP under the acidic and combined conditions. Also, the gene 
 <italic class="italic">ndufb8</italic>, which encodes NADH dehydrogenase 1 beta subcomplex subunit 8, which is capable of independent respiratory chain activity in mitochondria [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], was downregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> under acidified conditions. Together, these results suggest that both species prioritize aerobic metabolism for energy production in muscle, with 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> showing a greater capability of producing energy under our experimental conditions compared to control by increasing the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> and by maintaining 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> expression. Also, differences found in the expression of genes related with energy metabolism can result from the higher thermostability and structural differences found in HIF1Î± for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>, since this protein is a main regulatory agent of this function.
