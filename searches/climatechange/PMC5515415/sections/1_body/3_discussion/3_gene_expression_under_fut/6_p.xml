<p class="p">Glutamine ammonia ligase or glutamine synthetase (encoded by the 
 <italic class="italic">glula</italic> gene) plays a key role in nitrogen metabolism, catalyzing the conversion of ammonia and glutamate to glutamine, a less toxic compound that is used in the production of several other metabolites [
