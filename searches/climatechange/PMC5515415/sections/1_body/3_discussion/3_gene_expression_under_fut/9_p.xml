 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Some evidence that temperature may alter gene expression of immune response-related genes is already available [

 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Our results, raise some concerns for medium- to long-term exposure to predicted climate change, since a drastic downregulation was observed for the 
 <italic class="italic">gpb1</italic> gene for the combined warming and acidification condition. Although we analyzed only one gene related to the immune system, the combination of these two environmental factors severely decreased its expression, putatively leading to its suppression. Therefore, further attention should be paid to the effects and interactions of the multiple environmental factors involved in climate change on genes involved in the immune response.
