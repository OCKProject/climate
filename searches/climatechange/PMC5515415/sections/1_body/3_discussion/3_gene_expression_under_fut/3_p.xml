<p class="p">HSP70 and HSP90 proteins usually form a complex of chaperones that help in the correct folding of important proteins for cell functioning. However, both proteins are capable of independent activity. While HSP70 is responsible for the folding of nascent proteins and other important cell processes (e.g. trafficking of proteins across membranes), the most common client proteins of HSP90 are regulators of transcription or protein kinases (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] for further details). Therefore, the observed differences in 
 <italic class="italic">hsp90aa1</italic> gene expression may be related to subtsract interactions of HSP90 protein, with

 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> possibly incurring altered transcriptional regulation under the warming condition.Moreover, these expression differences between the two species, in 
 <italic class="italic">hsp90aa1</italic>, can be related to the higher thermostability of the corresponding coding protein observed in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>. In contrast, pH 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> did not affect the genes involved in protein folding, except for 
 <italic class="italic">fkbp4</italic>, which possesses peptidylprolyl isomerase activity [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] and whose catalysis may depend on environmental pH [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Therefore, the lack of gene expression response in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> could be related with the structural differences between the proteins of both species that encode this gene (FKBP52). Also, the observed results for 
 <italic class="italic">fkbp4</italic> may be related with its immunoregulatory functions [

 <italic class="italic">stip1</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">hop</italic> (Hsp70-Hsp90 Organizing Protein)] mediates the transfer of proteins from HSP70 to HSP90, through the formation of an “intermediate complex” composed of these three proteins and the substrate protein (mainly steroid hormone receptors) [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. The severe downregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">stip1</italic> gene transcription under the combined warming and acidification condition in liver tissues of both species highlights the importance of synergistic effects in climate change studies.
