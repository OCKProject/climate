<p class="p">We did not find significant differences for the 
 <italic class="italic">lox</italic> gene among fish under different conditions. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) catalyzes the formation of lysine-derived cross-links in collagen and elastin and it is involved in several other biological functions (e.g. development, tumor suppression, cell motility and cellular senescence) [

 <italic class="italic">lox</italic> gene is vital during development and in atypical cell functioning [
