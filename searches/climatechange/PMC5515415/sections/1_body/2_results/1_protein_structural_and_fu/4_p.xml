<p class="p">In addition to the above-mentioned folding proteins, two other proteins presented structural alterations. HIF1α exhibited structural changes at the helix-loop-helix (bHLH), Per-ARNT-Sim (PAS) and DNA-binding domains. The HIF1α transcription factor presented two non-synonymous substitutions between species (
