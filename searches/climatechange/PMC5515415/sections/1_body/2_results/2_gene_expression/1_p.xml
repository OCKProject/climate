<p class="p">Stability values of the reference genes 
 <italic class="italic">pabpc1a</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">rpl35</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">rpsa</italic> were high (less than 0.06 for all tissues and temperatures tested and, on average, less than 0.045) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0181325.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>, supporting information), with little variation (stability values of 
 <italic class="italic">rpsa</italic> varied between 0.029 and 0.041, for 
 <italic class="italic">rpl35</italic> between 0.017 and 0.051, and for 
 <italic class="italic">pabpc1a</italic> between 0.030 and 0.059). These stability values are inferior to those observed by [
 <xref rid="pone.0181325.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], which makes them suitable for gene expression normalization of our target genes.
