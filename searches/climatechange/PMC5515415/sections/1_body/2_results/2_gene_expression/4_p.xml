<p class="p">Regarding genes related to energy metabolism, most differences occurred under combined conditions of warming and acidification, with both species presenting several significant alterations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181325.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> genes presented the greatest differences in expression, particularly for muscle tissue, in which distinct patterns were found for both species: 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> was downregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> was upregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic>. Both species showed a similar response in liver tissue, with both these genes being upregulated under combined conditions of warming and acidification (though for 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> was only marginally significant). The 
 <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> gene was significantly upregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">torgalensis</italic> liver under combined warming and acidification, presenting a similar pattern as that observed for the 
 <italic class="italic">cs</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ldha</italic> genes. However, only 
 <italic class="italic">hif1a</italic> changes were statistically significant for 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> liver under the same combined conditions. Expression of the 
 <italic class="italic">ndufb8</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">glula</italic> genes (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181325.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) changed in 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">carolitertii</italic> muscle, but that of the 
 <italic class="italic">lox</italic> gene did not (
