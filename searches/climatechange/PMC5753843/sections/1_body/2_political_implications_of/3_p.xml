<p class="p">Less explicitly, the Plan B framing also privileges particular climate engineering options over others by determining that they should be fast-working to be of most interest. This is because, as part of a Plan B, the technologies would only be used once Plan A had already failed – or when it was clear that it was going to fail: ‘Chances are that if countries begin deploying geoengineering systems, it will be because calamitous climate change is near at hand … as a last resort’ (

For this reason, high-leverage, fast-working technologies such as stratospheric aerosol injection (continuously spraying reflective particles into the stratosphere to reduce the amount of incoming sunlight and thereby offsetting some or all human-induced global warming) have been closely linked with the Plan B framing (

For this reason, and because they are widely considered the leading contenders, the rest of this article focuses mainly on the security implications of high-leverage, fast-working solar geoengineering technologies such as stratospheric aerosol injection.
