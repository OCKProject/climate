<p class="p">As an imaginary, Reluctant Geoengineering should not be understood as a cohesive narrative, but precisely as a publicly performed vision within which discussions of the relative feasibility and justifications of various methods of climate engineering unfold. 
 <xref rid="bibr9-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rob Bellamy (2015)</xref> identifies five distinct imaginaries around climate engineering, but here I take the imaginary to be the institutionally stabilized backdrop to discussions between diverse positions. While varied in content, Reluctant Geoengineering as a whole nonetheless carries with it some general implications.
