<p class="p">Third, Plan B draws a boundary between two sets of measures grouped into two discrete plans. This encourages a segregation of assessments, ensuring that climate engineering options are not compared systematically to conventional options considered part of Plan A. Thus, climate engineering methods are typically assessed against ‘business as usual’ or in comparison with each other rather than being compared to effective mitigation, adaptation, and renewable energy transition scenarios (
