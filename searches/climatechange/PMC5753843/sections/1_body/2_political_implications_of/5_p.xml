<p class="p">Most importantly for questions of international politics and security, however, crucial assumptions about the political feasibility of climate engineering are also built into the Plan B framing. A ‘Plan B’ is by convention a fallback option that can be turned to if and when a Plan A fails or becomes otherwise unavailable.

 </sup> Logically a Plan B must be feasible, since if Plan B were viewed as both less desirable 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> more difficult to realize than Plan A it would not be relevant at all. A Plan B framing therefore establishes climate engineering as overall less desirable, but also less susceptible to the obstacles perceived to be thwarting effective mitigation. Importantly, the Royal Society report lays the blame for the failure of Plan A squarely at the door of 
 <italic class="italic">political</italic> difficulties rather than technical or even economic challenges: the failure of mitigation was deemed to be ‘largely due to social and political inertia’, and climate engineering could therefore ‘provide a useful complement’ (
 <xref rid="bibr99-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shepherd, 2009</xref>: 57), which implies that it would not suffer from the same deficiency. Crutzen seems, similarly, to point to the ‘grossly disappointing international political response to the required greenhouse gas emissions’ (
 <xref rid="bibr30-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crutzen, 2006</xref>: 214), declaring that the idea that effective mitigation could be achieved amounts to nothing more than a ‘pious wish’ (
 <xref rid="bibr30-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Crutzen, 2006</xref>: 217). International politics is thus blamed for the failure of Plan A, and in the Reluctant Geoengineering imaginary the relative feasibility of climate engineering – assuming it is studied sufficiently in technical terms – almost becomes a premise rather than a question.
