<p class="p">This article therefore explores how security politics and climate engineering could affect each other. After a first section setting out climate engineering as a ‘sociotechnical imaginary’, the second section shows how this imaginary and the key idea of ‘Plan B’ have narrowed down the debate about the technologies and framed them in a particular way, obscuring some possible security implications. The third section then provides a more systematic exploration of climate engineering and security, arguing that the problem of international state conflict, while potentially serious, is not the most likely outcome. What in this article I call the ‘security hazard’ is more certain to cause dynamics that will be unconducive to successful implementation of climate engineering but could also negatively affect the prospects for international cooperation around mitigation and adaptation. While not necessarily insurmountable or inevitable, the security hazard should be factored into any assessments of whether climate engineering is likely, ultimately, to reduce climate-related risks.</p>
