One subcategory involves regulating the amount of energy reaching the Earth from the sun (‘solar radiation management’ (SRM)), for example by injecting aerosols into the stratosphere to increase the Earth’s albedo. Others are designed to capture and store carbon dioxide, effectively reversing carbon emissions (‘carbon dioxide removal’ (CDR)) (
