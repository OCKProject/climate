 <xref rid="bibr57-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kintisch, 2010</xref>), and institutional stabilization of the imaginary moved up a notch further with a series of reports and accelerated research, including the landmark Royal Society report in 2009 (

The Royal Society explicitly rejected a taboo and recommended more (carefully governed) research into a ‘Plan B’ in case a climate emergency develops that requires rapid action to cool the Earth or bring down greenhouse gas concentrations (

The summary for policy makers of the IPCC’s (2014) latest assessment report reserved its final paragraph for CDR methods, and the US Senate has recently passed a bill recommending funding for research into ‘albedo modification’ (i.e. SRM methods) (
