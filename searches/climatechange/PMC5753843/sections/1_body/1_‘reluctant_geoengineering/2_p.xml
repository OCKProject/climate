<p class="p">Most methods of climate engineering have yet to be fully designed, let alone tested or implemented, and so it is not possible to examine the security impacts of the technologies as actual, embodied devices. However, understood as a sociotechnical imaginary – a ‘collectively held, institutionally stabilized, and publicly performed vision of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technology’ (
 <xref rid="bibr52-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jasanoff, 2015</xref>: 4) – climate engineering already exists. As a concept, ‘sociotechnical imaginaries’ is part of a wider effort to avoid the notion that technologies can be assessed as discrete contraptions, divorced from wider infrastructures and normative, social, and political visions of the future (
 <xref rid="bibr12-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bijker et al., 1987</xref>). The concept links technology intimately to ‘not only visions of what is attainable through science and technology but also of how life ought, or ought not, to be lived’ (
 <xref rid="bibr52-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jasanoff, 2015</xref>: 4). Desired futures are of course correlated with opposite visions of what might go awry. Dystopian visions are thus also part of sociotechnical imaginaries (
 <xref rid="bibr52-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jasanoff, 2015</xref>: 4), and hence security politics is built into technologies of this kind.
