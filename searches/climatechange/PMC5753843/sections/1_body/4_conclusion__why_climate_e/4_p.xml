<p class="p">At the very least, despite the initially much lower economic costs, the security hazard described in this article makes the politics of climate engineering look more costly and decidedly unlike an ‘easy option’ politically. This does not mean that climate engineering should not be pursued and explored further. But awareness of such risks might help guard against them – and may also help abate any moral hazard arising from an unrealistic assumption about the political feasibility of ‘Plan B’. Assessments of whether a technology can reduce climate risks should weigh risks of inaction, on the one hand, against the environmental but also the political risks of geoengineering, on the other.</p>
