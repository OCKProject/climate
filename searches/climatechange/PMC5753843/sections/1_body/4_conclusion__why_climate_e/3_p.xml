<p class="p">Conceivably, security dynamics could also turn out to assist the development of climate engineering by fostering research and deployment through the urgency and purpose of the invocation of security, crisis, and catastrophe. Securitization might allow exceptional means, including drastic mitigation. But such scenarios of security-driven policy would most likely challenge another of the assumptions behind Reluctant Geoengineering: that these technologies would only be implemented with some form of broad consent and/or governance. Even without security conflicts currently dogging climate negotiations, few observers are optimistic enough to envisage a comprehensive system of global governance of SRM with high legitimacy. Relatively optimistic scenarios involving heroic assumptions of rationality on the part of states suppose that a small group of states with climate engineering capabilities would proceed alone and with weak legalization, at least at first, perhaps with a qualified majority voting on deployment among a self-appointed group of insiders at a later stage (

If by drawing on a politics of existential threat and emergency measures there is a risk that climate technologies may also be taken out of the realm of normal political discourse and debate and into the realm of ‘necessity’ and urgency, and the rest of climate change therefore becomes subject to security logics, these issues of cooperation and agreement would become more, not less, acute.
