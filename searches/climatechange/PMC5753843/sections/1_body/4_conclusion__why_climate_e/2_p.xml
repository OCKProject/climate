<p class="p">This points to a wider set of neglected issues around how climate engineering might interact politically with other forms of climate policy beyond the moral hazard problem. Deployment of stratospheric aerosols is likely to include a complex mix of interventions and compensatory measures rather than the straightforward models put forward in simulations. Stratospheric aerosol injection will most likely necessitate some means of offsetting unwanted regional effects of stratospheric aerosol injection, for example. This adds to political and institutional demands in scenarios that make use of climate engineering, adding reasons for skepticism about political feasibility.</p>
