<p class="p">As a sociotechnical imaginary, climate engineering is more than a set of technological devices. It has been cast as a ‘Plan B’: only to be used in the event of the failure of the preferred option of effective mitigation against the backdrop of damaging global warming. This has led some to suppose that climate engineering would not be subject to the same political obstacles and could be made available as long as it turned out to be technically feasible. Although it is envisaged that climate engineering could ‘buy time’ for effective mitigation, in the three ways described above, it could also involve a security hazard that might delay mitigation. Whether climate engineering is less of a ‘pious wish’ than effective global mitigation depends not just on whether the technologies can be invented and scaled up, but also on some momentous assumptions about international relations and the scope for cooperation. Effective climate mitigation could be made more difficult by high-leverage climate engineering technologies that introduce intentionality and shorter chains of causation to climate politics. And dynamics of risk and catastrophe that underlie Reluctant Geoengineering and more recent precautionary approaches could promote new forms of security politics. This could
