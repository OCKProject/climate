<p class="p">This international security hazard detracts from the main selling points of aerosol injection and other high-leverage methods: fast implementation and light political burden. Global agreements are, as climate politics observers know, hard to achieve – and inclusive ones that give all interested parties a relevant say, especially so (a ‘pious wish’, to echo Crutzen). Any idea that climate engineering can be used to cut through the Gordian knot of global politics ignores this or imagines ungoverned or imposed climate engineering, which would in itself carry increased risk of conflict – and contravene the ‘governance’ assumption of the Reluctant Geoengineering imaginary. Either way, the security hazard rears its head and suggests climate engineering may not necessarily be politically easier to implement than a global deal on mitigation and adaptation - even when assuming heroically that rational states are the only significant actors.</p>
