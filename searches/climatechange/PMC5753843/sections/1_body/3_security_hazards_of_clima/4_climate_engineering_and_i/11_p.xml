<p class="p">A climate engineering war, although unlikely, would of course be hugely consequential and thus should not be excluded when considering whether climate engineering really would reduce climate risks. The less calamitous but more likely security hazard derives from the difficulties of managing ‘cooperation under anarchy’. Even under the neoliberal institutionalist assumptions, building a comprehensive regime would be time-consuming, and prone to setbacks and incessant ‘gaming’. Optimists envisage that the best case is minilateral, in which just a small select group begins the process. Consultation processes and compensation schemes and side payments for groups who lose out (or are able to leverage claims for payments) would of course be costly both in political transaction costs and potentially in economic terms, allowing the dreaded ‘burden sharing’ problem to reappear. For the neorealists cooperation is even less likely, and the political costs, time, and sheer trickiness/impossibility of implementing climate engineering in a way that deals safely and consultatively with the risk of conflicts make it an altogether unpalatable option (among other unpalatable options, of course).</p>
