<p class="p">Ultimately, whether geopolitical conflict or cooperation is likely as a result of climate engineering depends largely on assumptions about state rationality and the magnitude of risk thought to exist in the international system in the first place. Of course, the risk of a climate engineering-induced war should not be ruled out, but it seems to depend in the literature mostly on assumptions about the international system in general and on historical conflict levels that could be enflamed by geoengineering. All things being equal, the more uni- or minilateral the eventual imposition of solar climate engineering, the more conflict potential (
