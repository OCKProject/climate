<p class="p">To the extent that security features as a theme in the geoengineering imaginary, it concerns relations between states, most commonly in the form of the risk of war or conflict (see, for example,

 <xref rid="bibr23-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jamais Cascio (2009)</xref>, it is the ‘combination of differential impact and relatively low cost that makes international disputes over geoengineering almost inevitable’, and it is only a matter of time before ‘the world’s militaries learn to wield the planet itself as a weapon’. Climate engineering critics warn: ‘you can imagine the extraordinary risks we would be taking when we turn the global climate system into a theatre of war, but that’s one of the scenarios being mooted by strategic experts’ (Clive Hamilton cited in

Even proponents of research, such as David Keith, are clear that stratospheric aerosol injection poses novel international risks that would require governance mechanisms at levels similar to (or better than) those currently governing nuclear weapons:

  <p class="p">It is so cheap that almost any nation could afford to alter the earth’s climate, a fact that may accelerate the shifting balance of global power, raising security concerns that could, in the worst case, lead to war. If misused, geoengineering could drive extraordinarily rapid climate change, imperiling global food supply. In the long run, stable control of geoengineering may require new forms of global governance and may prove as disruptive to the political order of the 21st century as nuclear weapons were for the 20th.
