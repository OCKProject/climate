<p class="p">In contrast, for those more indebted to neorealist assumptions, ideas about such institutional evolution underestimate cooperation problems, including the ‘free-driver’ (as opposed to the ‘free-rider’) problem (Weitzman, 2012): because of the relatively low costs of delivering stratospheric aerosols, preventing unilateral or ‘rogue’ climate engineering is a major worry. The problem is not so much that some states may wish to exclude others from the regime, but ‘that some countries will

Climate engineering programs may be launched not to tackle a common threat but in order to engineer a climate that aligns with the particular preferences of the state in question. States may well act or campaign according to their own particular interests. The idea of counteracting or forming balancing coalitions against other states engaged in climate engineering is a possibility from this perspective, since it could be deployed as an instrument of state power (see 
 <xref rid="bibr47-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horton and Reynolds, 2016</xref>: 449). For 
 <xref rid="bibr46-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Joshua Horton (2011</xref>: 56–57), the rogue climate engineer scenario is a myth ‘grounded more in unexamined policy assumptions than in reasoned analysis’, since the incentives to cooperate would outweigh the individual benefits to climate engineering alone. But this assumes cooperation is an option and that states rationally optimize. As a tool of state power, climate engineering is unlikely to be viewed simply as a ‘global public good’ provided by those able and willing to do so (
 <xref rid="bibr15-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bodansky, 2012</xref>), since ‘rather than underprovision, the main threats [of stratospheric aerosols] are of competitive, predatory, parochial, and other unethical forms of provision’ (
