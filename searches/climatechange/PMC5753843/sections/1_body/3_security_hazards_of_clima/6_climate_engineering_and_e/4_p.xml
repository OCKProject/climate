<p class="p">In an interesting shift 
 <italic class="italic">away</italic> from the emergency framing of the Plan B imaginary and towards a more governmental approach, some leading climate engineering researchers have recently argued in favor of a ‘temporary, moderate and responsive scenario for solar geoengineering’ (
 <xref rid="bibr55-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keith and MacMartin, 2015</xref>: 201). In this scenario, SRM would be started not as an emergency measure but rather as a precaution while the jury remains out on the ultimate success or failure of mitigation and adaptation. Stratospheric aerosols would be introduced early but gradually to offset only up to half of anthropogenic climate forcing and only for as long as ‘acceptable’. For Keith, the threat of climate change is not existential, and he in effect makes a desecuritizing move, stressing that ‘the claim that climate change threatens an imminent catastrophe is an attempt to play a trump card of (seemingly) objective science in order to avoid debate about the trade-offs at the heart of climate policy’ (
 <xref rid="bibr54-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Keith, 2013</xref>: 24). In this version, SRM is a provider of a ‘breathing space’ (
 <xref rid="bibr72-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morton, 2015</xref>: 162). If the breather is used to simultaneously reduce emissions and then eventually to bring down greenhouse gas concentrations until stratospheric aerosols can be phased out again, this also ‘smoothes over the PlanA/PlanB dichotomy’ (
 <xref rid="bibr72-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morton, 2015</xref>: 163). This would require routine rather than emergency governance mechanisms. 
 <xref rid="bibr72-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morton (p.</xref> 163) imagines that ‘exploring the potential of geoengineering could spur and shape the development of a new way of making planetary decisions’. In other words, used as a tool of risk control and optimization (rather than emergency), climate engineering becomes a potential midwife to new institutions and instruments of global governance: ‘Much better, rather than treating geoengineering as a technocratic way of avoiding politics, to use it as a way of reinventing politics’ (p. 164).
