<p class="p">A third notion of security posits it neither as state policy nor as a ‘discourse of drama and emergency’ (
 <xref rid="bibr21-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buzan and Hansen, 2009</xref>: 217) but as a tool for the routine governance or refashioning of societies. Approaches like securitization theory that emphasize exceptionality as the core of security politics have been challenged by accounts that focus on the mundane and everyday institutionalization of security. Security politics is in this optic not an exceptional case or confined to a discrete policy area, but a general mode of governing and exercising control over societies (

Security has also been infused with logics of risk: security is not limited to dealing with existential threats, but also includes smaller-scale, lower-level, and hypothetical dangers. Risk-based security focuses not on direct causes of harm (threats), but on risks understood as ‘conditions of possibility or
