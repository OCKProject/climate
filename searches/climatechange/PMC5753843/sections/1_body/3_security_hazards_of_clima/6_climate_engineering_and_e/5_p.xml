<p class="p">The security hazard element here is that climate engineering generates more, not less, security politics, potentially giving birth not just to new consultative bodies, but also to undemocratic practices or – for the skeptics – contributing to creating an authoritarian global state. 
 <xref rid="bibr49-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mike Hulme (2014</xref>: 56) declared the technology ‘ungovernable’ on account of its indiscriminate effects, inherent uncertainty, and politically explosiveness, with global agreement about its deployment ‘improbable’. Others argue it may be governable, but only by way of centralized implementation – that is, only via basically undemocratic means and if imposed by a central actor (

The insurance metaphor in Reluctant Geoengineering invokes the possibility of future calamity and emergency to justify climate engineering (for a critique, see
