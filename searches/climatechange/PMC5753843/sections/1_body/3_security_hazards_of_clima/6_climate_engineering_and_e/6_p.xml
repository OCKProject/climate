<p class="p">For Reluctant Geoengineering, stratospheric aerosol injection is justified in terms of averting a catastrophe preemptively. Particularly since the advent of the War on Terror, the appeal of preemptory measures has expanded the remit of security politics to potentialities and catastrophic scenarios (

 <xref rid="bibr84-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prozorov, 2005</xref>). The ‘politics of catastrophe’ draws on imagination and sensorial experience as well as statistical forms of calculating risk (
 <xref rid="bibr2-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aradau and Van Munster, 2011</xref>: 2). Viewed as an instance of the politics of catastrophe, like the fear of nihilistic terrorism or nuclear calamity, climate change promises a potential rupture or interruption to a way of life. Like nuclear weapons or 9/11, it signifies a potential new social order (Aradau and Van Munster, 2013: 5), marking ‘an exception to some form of already existing state of affairs’ (
 <xref rid="bibr1-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderson and Adey, 2012</xref>: 26). According to some, this favors precisely interventionism, including military operations, geoengineering, and other ‘large-scale transformational measures’ to ‘reorganize physical and ecological systems, land use, and human behavior on a planetary scale’ (
 <xref rid="bibr68-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mayer, 2012</xref>: 178). The security hazard here is thus that Reluctant Geoengineering, by activating the politics of catastrophe, attunes societies to radical security politics. This could in turn affect the pursuit of ‘Plan A’ that demands more cooperative, long-term and considered mitigation efforts.
