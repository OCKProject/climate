<p class="p">Seen through this lens, climate engineering technologies create yet more political zones out of previously natural ones, making sunlight and the climate system itself a target of regulation and governmental operations. Risk management logics and security politics are extended to the climate system proper. The very term ‘solar radiation management’ hints at a governmental approach and draws in a new planetary dimension of global life, even beyond carbon, into the realm of politics and security. Climate scientists investigating and modeling climate engineering are in doing so (inadvertently) creating conditions for the governance of the skies – or, in the case of marine cloud brightening or ocean fertilization, the clouds and the seas.</p>
