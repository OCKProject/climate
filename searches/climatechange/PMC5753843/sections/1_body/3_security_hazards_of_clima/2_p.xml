<p class="p">How might this work? It is common in security studies to consider the ‘security dilemma’ – how attempts to gain security through augmenting security measures actually spur on adversaries to do the same and hence ultimately undermine security (

Of course, it is not that investing in climate engineering spurs the climate on to wreak more havoc (although the scientists are busy checking the climate risks of climate engineering). More akin to ‘blowback’, a security hazard arises if geoengineering creates new security problems that counteract or cancel out the overall aim of the technology, namely, to reduce climate risks.
