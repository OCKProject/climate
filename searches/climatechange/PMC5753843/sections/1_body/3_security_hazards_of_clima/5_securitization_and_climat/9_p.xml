<p class="p">At the same time securitization could also inject urgency, in effect acting as an adrenaline shot to climate politics. Those who have assumed responsibility by attempting to manipulate the climate might end up not just shouldering blame but also feeling more responsible. If solar geoengineering led to antagonisms between those perceived to be imposing ‘natural’ disasters and those experiencing them, climate politics might be elevated to the status of ‘high politics’ and given more urgency and attention. However, this could also work against climate engineering if the technologies themselves are securitized. Opponents depict them as a threat to the global environment (e.g. the ozone layer), human security (e.g. populations dependent upon the Indian Monsoon; see
