<p class="p">Relatedly, dual use (i.e. military applicability) of ‘many geoengineering techniques’ (
 <xref rid="bibr38-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ETC Group, 2009</xref>: 51) has been posed as a threat to security and stability, although hostile use of weather-modification technologies is currently prohibited by the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (see 
 <xref rid="bibr13-0967010617704142" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blackstock and Ghosh, 2011</xref>), and there are probably cheaper and more precise military methods available in most cases (

More importantly, the distinction between dual-use technologies and single-use civilian technologies blurs if harm is politically attributable. As numerous climate engineering skeptics (and David Keith) have asked, if climate engineering were implemented and adverse weather conditions ensued (which they inevitably would), how would affected nations react? Even if it were difficult to prove that harms caused by changed weather patterns or disasters were directly caused by climate engineering, the facilitating conditions would have been created to place political blame at one particular door. Relating to international security hazards and the necessity for broad cooperation, the narrower the group (perceived to be) responsible for the intervention, the stronger this mechanism might become.
