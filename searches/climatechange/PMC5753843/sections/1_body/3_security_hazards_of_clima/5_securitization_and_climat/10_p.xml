<p class="p">There are simultaneously attempts to desecuritize climate engineering in order to take it out of the ‘special measures’ category. Crutzen’s original attack on a scientific taboo on climate engineering relied in part on a claimed moral equivalence between deliberate and inadvertent human intervention in the climate (for a critique, see

Climate engineering is thus a theatre of both securitizing and desecuritizing moves, which potentially make for a less-than-smooth ride for climate engineers hoping to research and eventually progress to deployment of their technologies.
