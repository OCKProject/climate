<p class="p">Similarly, whereas climate change is currently the 
 <italic class="italic">un</italic>intended result of myriad actions over decadal time spans, fast and high-impact interventions would shorten the causal chain of harm and introduce intentionality. The weather would suddenly be attributable to somebody. With climate change, emissions are known to be harmful, particularly to countries vulnerable to global warming, but the chain of harm is long and complex and there is no intended harm. In contrast, solar climate engineering would introduce conditions that could more easily be articulated as acts of aggression – or at least as willful – since, with such technologies, political choices are linked directly and intentionally. Stratospheric aerosols would not have to be deployed explicitly for the purpose of harming another party in order for them to be taken as ‘hostile’. As
