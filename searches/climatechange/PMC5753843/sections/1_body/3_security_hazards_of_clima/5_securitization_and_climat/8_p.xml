<p class="p">These features of climate engineering risk infusing wider climate politics with antagonisms and an us–them logic that it is currently largely free from; although climate negotiations are rancorous, and loss and damage are increasingly salient, the parties do not tend to view each other as enemies. At the very least, liability for climatic disasters would become more politically charged and ‘uncertainty about causation could fuel accusations of responsibility’ (

If the climate becomes something somebody has done to somebody else, this changes climate politics quite radically. If climate politics were to become securitized, climate engineering might end up pushing global agreements on mitigation even further into the future. Securitization would shift climate politics into the category of politics in which exceptional means are legitimately used, undermining multilateral and cooperative efforts necessary for an effective global mitigation regime.
