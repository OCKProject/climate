 <result pre="and, in turn, encourage or inhibit intended political action on" exact="climate" post="change. Some of the seminal work in understanding how"/>

 <result pre="present study seeks to better understand how news stories about" exact="climate" post="change may differentially influence public opinion and engagement when"/>
 <result pre="emotional responses and intended political behavior in the context of" exact="climate" post="change. Overall, this study found that positive efficacy information"/>

 <result pre="led to countervailing indirect effects of efficacy information on intended" exact="climate" post="activism. The present study builds from our previous work"/>
 <result pre="several ways. First, the present study investigates the potential for" exact="climate" post="change messages that emphasize different types of efficacy to"/>
 <result pre="that facilitate, as well as those that inhibit, efficacy around" exact="climate" post="change (respectively referred to as positive and negative efficacy)."/>

 <result pre="response efficacy content will increase perceptions of response efficacy regarding" exact="climate" post="change. H3b: Exposure to negative response efficacy content will"/>
 <result pre="response efficacy content will lower perceptions of response efficacy regarding" exact="climate" post="change. With regard to the potential influences of efficacy"/>
 <result pre="positively linked with greater intentions to take political action around" exact="climate" post="change. Thus, we formally state: H4a: Perceptions of internal"/>

 <result pre="be positively associated with intentions to take political action on" exact="climate" post="change. H4c: Perceptions of response efficacy will be positively"/>
 <result pre="be positively associated with intentions to take political action on" exact="climate" post="change. Finally, we predict a significant mediation effect, such"/>
 <result pre="Associated Press. The news story discussed the likely impacts of" exact="climate" post="change, including heat waves, floods, droughts, extreme weather, and"/>

 <result pre="of climate change. What implications do these results have for" exact="climate" post="change communication? This study suggests that messages including positive"/>

 <result pre="better understand the implications of how they choose to cover" exact="climate" post="change for public opinion and behavior. We note again"/>
 <result pre="when journalists report on the efficacy of actions to address" exact="climate" post="change, the stories are heavily weighted towards discussing whether"/>
 <result pre="whether or not these actions will be successful in mitigating" exact="climate" post="change (response efficacy) and include very limited information on"/>
