Positive internal efficacy information increased perceptions of internal efficacy, in support of H1a, and negative external efficacy information lowered perceptions of external efficacy, in support of H2b. The other predicted influences of mediated efficacy content on efficacy perceptions, however, were not observed, failing to support H1b, H2a, H3a, and H3b. We also note that the OLS regression from the mediation analysis suggested a positive influence of internal efficacy information on perceptions of response efficacy, but this result should be treated cautiously as the Dunnett post-hoc examination of this relationship, which corrects for family-wise error, did not reveal a significant relationship. Thus, in the investigation of RQ1, which asked whether specific types of efficacy information in media stories may influence other types of efficacy perceptions, we did not find strong evidence of this effect occurring (although the relationship between internal efficacy information and response efficacy perceptions may be worth exploring in future examinations).
