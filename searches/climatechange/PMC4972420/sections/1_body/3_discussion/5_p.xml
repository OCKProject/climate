<p class="p">As mentioned above, messages that included positive internal efficacy information indirectly increased intentions to take political action; however, overall there was a limited effect of the media messages on perceived efficacy. Based on the Dunnett post-hoc tests, only two of the six experimental conditions, as compared to control, significantly shifted efficacy perceptions. One of these findings, the influence of negative external efficacy on perceived external efficacy, should be treated with some caution as well, as the R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> from the regression predicting perceived external efficacy was very low, at .04, indicating that the predictive variables had limited explanatory power. Nevertheless, the present study does find that when efficacy perceptions do increase they are significant predictors of intended political behavior; internal, external, and response efficacy all had strong positive associations with issue relevant political behavior while controlling for the other types of efficacy. Thus, future work should continue to develop and test media messages and other strategies that may more effectively increase perceptions of political efficacy in the context of climate change.
