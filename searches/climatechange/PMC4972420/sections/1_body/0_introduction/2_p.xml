<p class="p">The present study examines a critical element that influences whether or not members of the public engage in political action around issues such as climate change: their sense of efficacy. Efficacy refers to individualsâ€™ perception that a problem is addressable and that they are able to engage in the relevant action needed to address the problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Although perceived efficacy has been identified as an important variable in influencing political action in general [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and environmental activism specifically [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], scant research has investigated how efficacy information as a variable in media messages may influence perceptions of efficacy and political action in the context of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In two media content analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], we have developed a novel conceptualization of efficacy that combines elements from the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and approaches taken in political science [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The resulting framework proposes three types of efficacy that are likely to be important determinants of public political engagement around climate change: internal, external, and response efficacy. The present study draws from this framework to examine how varying these three types of efficacy information in media stories influences corresponding perceptions of efficacy, and how these perceptions of efficacy, in turn, predict willingness to take political action on the issue of climate change. Overall, we find that all three types of efficacy beliefs have a positive influence on intended political action, but media messages do not necessarily influence all three types of efficacy perceptions.
