<p class="p">In the political domain, efficacy connotes the feeling that “political and social change is possible, and the individual citizen can play a part in bringing about this change” [

Political science scholars have differentiated between two different types of efficacy: internal efficacy, which refers to one’s personal sense that they can understand politics and act effectively in the political realm, and external efficacy, which reflects individuals’ beliefs about the government’s responsiveness to citizen demands [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. These forms of efficacy have been found to be important motivators of general political participation [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], arguably because they help reduce the perceived costs and increase the perceived benefits of taking action in the political sphere. Myriad survey-based studies have linked exposure or attention to news and other forms of media to perceived internal and/or external political efficacy [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Still, based on these studies, it is difficult to know what exactly it is about media exposure that influences perceived efficacy. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to manipulate political efficacy information in climate change news stories in order to isolate its potential effects on perceived political efficacy and intended political behavior.
