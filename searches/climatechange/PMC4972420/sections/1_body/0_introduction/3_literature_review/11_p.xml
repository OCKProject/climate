<p class="p">The present study builds from our previous work [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], as well as previous research on the EPPM and in political communication, in several ways. First, the present study investigates the potential for climate change messages that emphasize different types of efficacy to shift public perceptions of efficacy, which past research [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] did not examine. In addition, our previous research in this area [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] only examined the influence of statements about factors that may facilitate efficacy; the present study expands on this approach by examining statements about factors that facilitate, as well as those that inhibit, efficacy around climate change (respectively referred to as positive and negative efficacy). To our knowledge, the present study also offers the first test of how perceptions of internal, external, and response efficacy may independently influence intentions to engage in political behavior related to climate change. Thus, the overall aim of the present study is to identify how positive or negative statements regarding internal, external, and response efficacy may influence intended political behavior as mediated by perceptions of these three types of efficacy.
