<p class="p">The present study utilizes our proposed conceptualization of efficacy for political issues such as climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], which combines elements from the aforementioned approaches taken by the EPPM [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and political science [

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. This approach examines three aspects of efficacy: internal efficacy, external efficacy, and response efficacy. As mentioned above, internal efficacy, which is very similar to the concept of self-efficacy in the EPPM, captures the ease with which individuals are able to take political action [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Indicators of internal efficacy include whether an individual feels they are knowledgeable enough about politics or a political issue and have the ability to take political action such as writing a letter to an elected official. However, even when an individual feels that they are able to take action such as writing a letter, a critical factor in whether they choose to do so is whether they believe that politicians themselves will actually respond to public engagement and input [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. This second factor is referred to as external efficacy, which reflects individualsâ€™ perception of whether elected officials will respond to public opinion and calls for policy change [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Finally, even if an individual believes that politicians will respond to calls for action, an additional factor is whether the political action that does occur will successfully address the issue. This final factor is referred to as response efficacy, which captures whether proposed policy action to address issues such as climate change will actually be effective in doing so [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>].
