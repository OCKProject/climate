<p class="p">Multiple studies have examined how strategic messaging and news coverage may influence public support for climate mitigation policy and willingness to take political action on the issue [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. While these studies have analyzed multiple message components, we are only aware of a single study that has examined how efficacy information may influence such engagement [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Efficacy, however, is a critical component in driving risk-related behavior change [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and political participation [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], and the present study helps fill this research gap by examining how different types of efficacy information in news stories may influence perceptions of efficacy and, in turn, encourage or inhibit intended political action on climate change.
