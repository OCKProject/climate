<p class="p">Ecological beliefs were measured using a well established scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], which asks participants how much they agree or disagree with the following statements: 1) “The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset by human activities,” 2) “Ecological, rather than economic, factors must guide our use of natural resources,” 3) “We attach too much importance to economic measures of well being in our society,” 4) “We are approaching the limit of the number of people the earth can support,” 5) “When humans interfere with nature, it often produces disastrous consequences,” 6) “Humans must live in harmony with nature in order to survive,” 7) “There are limits to growth beyond which our industrialized society cannot expand.” Each question was answered on a 7-point scale that ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). The items were averaged into a single ecological beliefs scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .85, M = 5.11, SD = 1.09).
