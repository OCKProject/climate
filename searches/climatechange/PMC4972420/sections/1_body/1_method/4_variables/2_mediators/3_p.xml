<p class="p">Perceived external efficacy was measured by asking participants how much they agreed or disagreed with the following statements: 1) “People like me don’t have any say about what the government does about climate change,” 2) “Public officials don’t care much about what people like me think about climate change,” and 3) “The government pays attention to what people like me think when they decide what to do about climate change.” These items were adapted from established measures of external political efficacy [

Each item was rated on a 7-point scale that ranged from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). Items (1) and (2) were reverse coded, and the three items were then averaged into a single external efficacy scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .75, M = 3.28, SD = 1.35).
