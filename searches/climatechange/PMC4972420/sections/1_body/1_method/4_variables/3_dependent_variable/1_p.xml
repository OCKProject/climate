<p class="p">Intended climate change-related political participation was measured by asking participants how likely or unlikely it is that in the next twelve months they will engage in the following activities: 1) “contact government officials to urge them to take action to reduce climate change,” 2) “participate in a rally or protest in support of action to reduce climate change,” 3) “sign a petition in support of taking action to reduce climate change,” 4) “join or volunteer with an organization working to reduce climate change,” and 5) “donate money to an organization working to reduce climate change.” The likelihood of each activity was answered separately on a 7-point scale that ranged from very unlikely (1) to very likely (7). The respective answers were then averaged together to create a single political behavior scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .92, M = 3.45, SD = 1.64).</p>
