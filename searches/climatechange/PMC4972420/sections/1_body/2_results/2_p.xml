<p class="p">Looking next to external efficacy, the overall test of between subject effects was significant (F (6, 1419) = 3.64, p &lt; .001). The 1-sided Dunnett post-hoc analysis showed that the negative external efficacy condition led to significantly lower perceptions of external efficacy compared to control (p &lt; .05), in support of H2b. As no other condition significantly shifted perceived external efficacy compared to control, the results failed to support H2a, which predicted that positive external efficacy information would increase perceptions of external efficacy.</p>
