<p class="p">PROCESS was utilized to investigate whether the respective experimental conditions, as compared to the control condition, had any mediated effects on intended political participation through the three types of perceived efficacy. Looking first to the influence of the experimental conditions on perceived efficacy from the PROCESS regression analysis (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), the positive internal efficacy condition significantly increased perceived internal efficacy (unstandardized b = .31, p &lt; .05), the negative external efficacy condition significantly reduced perceived external efficacy (b = -.30, p &lt; .05), and the positive internal efficacy condition significantly increased perceived response efficacy (b = .29, p &lt; .05); no other relationships between the treatment conditions and perceived efficacy were significant. Looking next to the influence of the three types of efficacy on intentions to engage in political behavior (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), perceived internal (b = .28, p &lt; .001), external (b = .29, p &lt; .001), and response (b = .37, p &lt; .001) efficacy all had significant positive associations with political behavior, in support of H4a, H4b, and H4c. Finally, looking to the mediated influence of the treatment conditions, through perceived efficacy, onto intended political behavior (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), the positive internal efficacy condition had significant positive indirect effects through perceived internal efficacy (b = .09, lower level confidence interval (LLCI) = .016, upper level confidence interval (ULCI) = .17) and response efficacy (b = .11, LLCI = .023, ULCI = .20), while the negative external efficacy condition had a significant negative indirect effect through perceived external efficacy (b = -.08, LLCI = -.17, ULCI = -.013). No other mediated relationships were significant, offering partial support for H5.
