<p class="p">We first examined how the experimental conditions influenced the mediators of internal, external, and response efficacy with a one-way ANOVA using 1-sided Dunnett post-hoc tests comparing each condition to control. The means of perceived internal, external, and response efficacy by condition are provided in 
 <xref rid="pone.0157658.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Looking first to the influence on perceptions of internal efficacy, the overall test of between subject effects was significant (F (6, 1,419) = 3.75, p &lt; .001). Post-hoc investigations revealed that the positive internal efficacy condition increased perceptions of internal efficacy compared to the control condition (p &lt; .05), in support of H1a. No other condition significantly shifted perceptions of internal efficacy compared to control. Thus, the results failed to support H1b, which predicted that negative internal efficacy information would lower perceived internal efficacy.
