<p id="Par4" class="p">Numerous methods have been used to quantify ET. 
 <italic class="italic">In situ</italic> measurements, such as weighing lysimeter, energy balance Bowen ratio systems, and eddy covariance technique are generally believed to be reliable methods for ET estimates

 </sup>. However, these methods are limited to measurement of a small scale (point scale, field scale, landscape scale) and therefore they are not applicable in obtaining details of ET datasets for spatial distribution in terms of a long time series. Similarly, traditional ET estimation models, whose parameters derived mostly from field observations, are greatly restricted to be used at a small scale, i.e., soil-plant-atmosphere continuum models
