 </sup> thought that the conversion from shrub land and sparse woodland to medium and high coverage grassland resulted in increased ET in an agricultural catchment on the LP from 1981 to 2000. However, with the expansion of the “green area” in the plateau, the regional ET is showing a significant change with a high degree of uncertainty, and few studies have focused on the changes and associated driving forces of ET in the LP in terms of human intervention (i.e., GFG project). To bridge this gap, we examined vegetation greening and climate change controls on ET over the Loess Plateau for the period 2000–2012 using the vegetation index model.
