<p id="Par6" class="p">The Loess Plateau (LP), the main portion of the Yellow River, is an ecologically vulnerable region and is well known for its high soil erosion rates, contributing ~90% of sediments in the Yellow River
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. In order to prevent soil erosion and restore the ecological functions of watersheds, the Chinese government has launched the Grain-for-Green (GFG) project, which is the largest active revegetation project in China or anywhere else
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. This project has greatly improved vegetation growth, and it was reported that the total afforested area of Ningxia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi during the period from 1999 to 2012 have reached 3.8 × 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> km

 </sup>. However, changes of vegetation cover will affect underlying surface characteristics and have both direct and indirect impacts on the local surface water and energy budget
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>. Over the past few decades, concerns have been arisen with arguments that large-scale vegetation restorations may result in water shortage

 </sup>. Comparatively, ET is a better time integrator of regional change than precipitation and streamflow, since the latter two variables are intermittent and non-linear processes whereas ET occurs every day
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, quantitative estimation of ET of the LP and further findings in the main driving factors for ET changes can significantly improve the eco-environment, balance the water consumption and properly allocate available water resources.
