<p id="Par14" class="p">The interannual variation in ET over the LP from 2000 to 2012 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>. On average, annual ET in the LP significantly increased (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.1), with an annual increase of 3.35 mm per year. However, the change of ET was not continuous throughout the 13-year period. The ET experienced a rapidly increasing trend from 2000 to 2003 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and then a significantly decreasing trend occurred in the next 3 years (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Such changes in ET corresponded well with that in P which reached the peak in 2003 and followed by a sharp decline to the average level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). After 2005, the annual ET increased steadily, with an annual increase rate of only 1.98 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.38). Annual P presented an insignificantly increasing trend during the whole study period (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.62), with an annual rate of 2.04 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, lower than that of ET, implying a possible pressure of water availability. Contrary to P, the annual PET decreased with a linear slope of −2.28 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.27), and the lowest value of 921.5 mm occurred in 2003 corresponding to the highest annual P (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). In comparison with meteorological variables, vegetation variable (LAI) showed a significantly increasing trend with less fluctuation, partly due to the vegetation physiological activity adaptation to climate change
