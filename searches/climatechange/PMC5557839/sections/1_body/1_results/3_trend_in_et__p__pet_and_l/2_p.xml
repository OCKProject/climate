<p id="Par15" class="p">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the spatial distribution patterns of trends in annual ET, P, PET and growing seasonal LAI in the LP presented prominent geographical heterogeneity. During the period 2000–2012, the annual ET increased ~86.6% and significantly increased ~28.0% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the study area. The highest trend occurred in the strip from the northeastern to the southwestern of the LP. By contrast, only about 13.3% (1.5%) of the study areas experienced a (significantly) decreasing ET trend, which were scattered in the southeast and northwest of the LP. In comparison to ET, temporal changes of annual P showed a mixed pattern of upward and downward trend in the LP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). The annual P at ~78.6% of the study areas experienced an increasing trend, with the highest value (&gt;4 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) occurred in the northern and southern regions. However, only ~0.04% (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) significantly increased. Conversely, annual P at only ~21.4% of the study areas experienced a slightly decreasing trend which was mainly distributed in the western and eastern LP. Compared with P, the annual PET decreased over large areas in the LP (87.3%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>), with the sharpest decrease in the south part of the LP. Regions with increased annual PET were mainly located in the central of the northern LP. For LAI, it was shown that the greening trends were overwhelming (91.4%), and the most prominent greening trends were distributed in the strip area between the northeastern and southeastern of the study region (Fig.
