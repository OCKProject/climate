<p id="Par16" class="p">The spatial distributions of seasonal ET trends during the period 2000–2012 on the LP are depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. There were obvious differences in spatial distribution trends patterns of ET for different seasons. ET in other seasons experienced an increasing tendency except in winter (DJF), with the trend of summer (JJA) being the closest to that of the annual ET (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b</xref>). In MAM and JJA, the relatively largest increase in ET mainly occurred in the middle of the study area, with the trend reaching up to 5 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. However, some areas in the south parts, e.g., Ziwuling and Huanglong regions where productive forests are extensively distributed, ET decreased in JJA but increased slightly in MAM. In SON, such positive ET trend mainly occurred in the central and north regions of the LP, with ~88.8% of pixels being affected (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>). By contrast, only some regions in the southeastern corner experienced obviously decreasing trend of the annual ET in DJF, which could be mainly ascribed to the significant decrease in the annual P (trend of 2 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6d</xref>).
