<p id="Par10" class="p">Averaged spatially over the whole region, the mean annual ET was 379 ± 22 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> over the last thirteen years, which accounted for 90% of the corresponding precipitation (P), suggesting that most of precipitation gives back to the atmosphere through evaporation. The spatial pattern of mean annual ET over the LP from 2000 to 2012 was shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>. Overall, the ET from the model has exhibited large spatial variability across the regions, decreasing gradually from the southeastern to northwestern areas, which is consistent with that of annual P and LAI in the growing season (monthly average from April to October) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b and d</xref>). Annual ET was generally higher than 400 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in extensive the southeastern LP, where croplands and productive forests were densely distributed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Meanwhile, these areas were also characterized by a warm temperature and relatively abundant P, and thus were suitable for vegetation growth. In comparison, annual ET less than 200 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> usually corresponds to grass and desert (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), and climate was featured by local low P (&lt;200 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>, the mean annual P was 420 ± 50 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and increased from 300 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 560 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> from the northwest to southeast of the LP.
