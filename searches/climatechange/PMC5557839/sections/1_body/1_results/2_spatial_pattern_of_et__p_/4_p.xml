<p id="Par13" class="p">The spatial patterns of seasonal ET, especially for the summer (June, July and August, JJA) ET, were similar to that of the annual ET, but with different magnitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The magnitude of ET showed gradients decreasing from the northwest to the southeast in all four seasons. Meanwhile, obvious seasonal cycles of ET could be detected. Specifically, during the summer season, mean monthly ET was 209 ± 12 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, accounting for over 55.3% of the annual ET, with a maximum of 390 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and a minimum of 70 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. In contrast, during spring (March, April and May, MAM) and autumn (September, October and November, SON), monthly ET were relatively smaller because of the unfavorable condition for growth (lower temperature and precipitation). During winter (December, January and February, DJF), ET was less than 30 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> over most of the region, reflecting vegetation dormancy and low solar energy.
