<p id="Par18" class="p">Based on the spatial distribution patterns of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>, the spatial distribution of dominant factors of ET changes in the entire region was shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref> (the 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> value in terms of the significant level between ET and climate/vegetation variables was higher than the sum of that from the other variables). The result showed that variations in LAI controlled the variability in ET at ~52.8% of pixels in the strip region from the northeastern to southwestern parts of the LP, where vegetation are greatly improved represented by a higher LAI increasing trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>). On the contrary, variations in the annual ET over this region controlled by P and PET alone were only at ~1% of pixels, which were scattered in the northwestern parts of the LP. ET changes in the remainder of the study areas could be regarded as the combined effect resulting from climate and vegetation changes (~46%). Further analysis suggested that vegetation change is the major controlling factor on interannual variability of annual ET in all ecosystems (Fig.
