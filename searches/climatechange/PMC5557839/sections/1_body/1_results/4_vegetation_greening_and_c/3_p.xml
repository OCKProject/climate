<p id="Par19" class="p">In order to examine the impacts of climate and vegetation change on ET trend in detail, PET were first separated into four major meteorological variables including mean air temperature (T), sunshine duration (S), relative humidity (H) and wind speed (W). Then we conducted the controlled factorial experiments under different scenarios (see Methods and also ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>). The model factorial simulation suggest that the average mean annual simulated net ET (all variables changing) was 17.7% higher than that of the control simulation (all variables fixed at the level of 2000), of which changes in LAI (15.7%), the two-way interactive effect of sunshine duration and vapor pressure (−2.4%), and the sum of all higher-order interactive effects (3.6%) explained the largest contribution to the decadal changes in ET of the LP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref>). Changes in sunshine duration (1.2%), and two-way interactive effect of vegetation and vapor pressure (0.5%), interactive effect of sunshine duration and air temperature (0.9%) impose a slight positive effect on ET, whereas wind speed (−0.2%), air temperature (−0.7%), and interactive effect of air temperature and vapor pressure (−0.8%) have slight negative effects on ET. However, all these positive or negative effects are exceeded by the impact of LAI change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref>), suggesting that vegetation greening is the primary driver of ET trend in the LP over the past thirteen years. Meanwhile, we found that the net effect of climate change is positive throughout the whole period except in 2005 (−4.1%) and 2011 (−3.0%), but much lower than the effect of vegetation change (Fig.
