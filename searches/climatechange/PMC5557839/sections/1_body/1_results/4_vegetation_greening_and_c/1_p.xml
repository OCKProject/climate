<p id="Par17" class="p">Averaged the whole LP, despite the increase of annual ET over the study period, it showed large interannual fluctuations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Therefore, to investigate the climate and vegetation control on interannual variations of ET, we conducted partial correlation analysis between ET and P, PET and LAI for each grid over the LP during 2000–2012 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), with all variables detrended. The partial correlation coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) between the annual ET and LAI was significant at ∼90% of pixels (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and high 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> values were generally located in the strip region from the northeast to the southwest regions of the LP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7c</xref>), where the LAI increased relatively rapidly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> between the annual ET and P was also relatively higher in the whole study region, but only ~27.8% of pixels were significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), which were generally distributed around the northern and western regions of LP where the annual mean P was relatively low (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Compared with LAI and P, it could be seen that no coherent spatial patterns were shown in the relationship between the annual ET and annual PET with mixed positive and negative correlation in northern and southern parts of the LP respectively (~6.2% and ~3.8% with significant level, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7b</xref>).
