<p id="Par8" class="p">Over the long-term period, the comparisons between simulated ET and observed mean ET (precipitation minus streamflow) for the 15 catchments from 2000 to 2011 indicated that the model generally performed well as judged by model statistics (Fig.

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, suggesting that the model slightly underestimated ET in these catchments. This result is reasonable because the model failed to consider the effect of water evaporation from the check-dams and irrigation.
