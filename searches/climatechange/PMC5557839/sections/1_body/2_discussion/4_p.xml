<p id="Par23" class="p">Although the vegetation index model have a good performance in predicting the annual ET over the LP, it is worthwhile to explore the uncertainties of the results. There is a limitation in this model in that it does not take into account of the impact of check-dam and irrigation on ET, thus resulting in a slight underestimation of ET (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Then again, some parameters used in the model were set as constant (the regression coefficients

 </sub>) or from a set of simple empirical formulation (albedo calculation), which will neglect the variability of model applicability at different time and space dimensions. In addition, the limited number and uneven distribution of the meteorological stations (e.g., few stations in the northern LP) can also affect the interpolation precision. Furthermore, different spatial resolution of data sources applied to drive the vegetation index model can be another cause of the discrepancies between the observed ET and the modeled ET. For example, the model simulated ET is at a 1-km scale, whereas LAI data are original 0.05 degree (about 5-km) resolution. Accordingly, vegetation index product with higher resolution should be employed in the future to enhance its ability to capture the spatial pattern of ET. In the ET validation, we used water balance ET (precipitation minus streamflow) which here constitutes the truth. Annual ET can be calculated as the residual between total precipitation and river discharge and terrestrial water storage change. However, we are not able to acquire such water storage data with high spatial resolution and accuracy for the entire study period. For example, despite the availability recently of terrestrial water storage datasets from gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) satellites, the spatial resolution of this datasets is 1° (i.e., 10000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for each grid), which is generally larger than the area of catchment used for validation. By contrast, the validation of our study was carried out on 13-year time scale (assumes hydrological steady state conditions) in which soil water storage was generally balanced even if vegetation was affected by human activities. Meanwhile, a recent study have reported that soil moisture decrease following the massive re-vegetation

 </sup>. Therefore, if the soil moisture is considered in the water balance, the verification accuracy of the model will be more robust.
