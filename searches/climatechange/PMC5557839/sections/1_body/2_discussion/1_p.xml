 </sup> concluded that with increasing tree transpiration and ecosystem water-use efficiency, the partitioning of ET appeared to be strongly influenced by temporal P patterns. Although the global land evapotranspiration trend showed a decline from 1998 to 2008
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>, the annual ET showed large interannual fluctuations with a significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2012 over the LP. Our results suggested that the variations in annual ET are attributed to the vegetation changes at more than half of the study areas. The ET upward trend is higher than that of P (3.35 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> versus 2.04 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), implying that agricultural production and food security will likely be threatened. Factorial simulation further suggest that vegetation greening promoted by the GFG project explained the largest contribution to the ET increasing trend of the LP, which is consistent with a recent work from a global terrestrial ET trends estimation
