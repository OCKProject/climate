<p id="Par21" class="p">First, at the biome level, forest ecosystems generally have a higher annual ET than that of herbage ecosystems on average due to higher total root biomass and deeper effective rooting depth

 </sup>. Meanwhile, shrubs and forests may be featured by a longer active transpiration period than the herbaceous plant growth seasonally, thus leading to a higher total annual transpiration than that of croplands. With the tree growing, the increase of vegetation coverage might lead to more interception by canopy, and although the evaporation of intercepted precipitation in grasslands or croplands is generally low, it can account for 10–20% and 20–40% of rainfall for broadleaf trees and conifers respectively

 </sup>. Second, afforestation can alter the surface energy exchange by affecting the land surface roughness, and give feedbacks to the regional ET

 </sup>. The soil type in most areas of the LP is loessial soil with light color (i.e., yellow) while the vegetation has relatively darker color. And therefore, when the barren hills are afforested, the land surface albedo is expected to decline. Besides, forests generally have lower albedo than croplands and grasslands

 </sup>, suggesting that the conversion of croplands to forest can result in the decrease in albedo. This has also been proved by previous studies based on MODIS products, which indicated that the average albedo cross the LP significantly declined over the period 2000–2013 due to the GFG project

 </sup>. All of these can result in an increase of the net shortwave radiation. On the assumption that all else being equal, there will be an increase in the upward longwave radiation (the longwave radiation emits from the surface into the atmosphere); however, this extra energy, resulting from lower albedo, can be dissipated with enhanced vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation
