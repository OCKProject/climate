  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>, wind speed over the plateau was also decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4d</xref>), which is further attributed to increases in terrestrial surface roughness

 </sup>. These above findings may explain that air temperature and wind speed exerted negative effects on the rises of ET over the LP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8a</xref>). Meanwhile, we found that annual ET peaked in 2003, being 8% higher than the annual mean values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). Further analysis showed that the high precipitation, and consequently relative humidity could explain this ET jump (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4c</xref>), despite a minor factor compared to LAI (2.11% versus 16.40%).
