<p id="Par24" class="p">On the other hand, vegetation and climate have complex and interactive effects on terrestrial ET. Consequently, it is impossible to completely distinguish the effects of vegetation and climate change on ET as vegetation is also a response of the terrestrial ecosystems to climate change. For example, climate change (e.g., climate warming) could promote vegetation productivity through an extension in the growing season duration and enhanced nitrogen mineralization rate

 </sup> and thus climate change could exert indirect effect on ET of the LP by influencing vegetation

 </sup>. Despite the above weakness, our study do provide insight into the potential magnitude of vegetation and climate change impacts on ET. It is clear that both vegetation greening and climate change contributed the increase in ET over the LP (Fig.Â
