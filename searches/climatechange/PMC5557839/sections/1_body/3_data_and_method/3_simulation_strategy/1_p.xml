<p id="Par38" class="p">In order to make the model simulation conform to the real scenarios for expressing the impacts of land cover change on the land surface evapotranspiration, we made the assumption that the land cover of the LP did not change for a certain period when land cover data were available. The land cover data for 2000, 2005, and 2010 were used for the periods of 2000–2004, 2005–2009, and 2010–2012, respectively.</p>
