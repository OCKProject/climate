 </sup>. The control simulation is the simulation forced by the vegetation conditions (LAI, albedo and land cover) and meteorological variables at the level of 2000. The ET result from the control simulation indicates the value given the normal 2000’s vegetation and climate conditions. Meanwhile, according to previous studies

 </sup>, we also calculated a two-way interaction between variable A and B which is the subtraction of the main effects of A and B from the effect of the joint A plus B treatment. The sum of all higher-order interactive effects (Other) is the difference between the effect of real condition and the sum of five main effects and ten two-way interactive effects. In total, we design 16 simulation scenarios (summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) to understand the effect of vegetation and climate change on annual ET over the LP from 2000 to 2012. More details about this factorial experiments could be found in ref.
