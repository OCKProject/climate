This product was retrieved from time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) surface reflectance data. Extensive validation for all biome types indicates that the GLASS LAI product can provide temporally-continuous LAI profiles with more improved quality and accuracy compared to the current MODIS and CYCLOPES products
