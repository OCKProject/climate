<p id="Par26" class="p">Meteorological forcing data including daily precipitation, air temperature, air pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and sunshine duration during the period 2000–2012, were obtained from China Meteorological Administration (CMA) at 65 stations located in and around the LP. These stations are well distributed in space and can reflect the characteristics of the regional climate. Most of these stations have collected complete data from 2000 to 2012. Missing daily data account for about 0.45% as an average for the 65 stations and were complemented by the median meteorological data from at least tree neighboring stations. All the meteorological data were spatially interpolated by the gradient inverse distance square (GIDS), which has been proven more precise compared with the ordinary Kriging and inverse distance squared interpolation method, as it could provide accurate estimates of spatial climatic variables by considering the effects of terrain, latitude and longitude through multivariate regressive analysis

 </sup>. To further check the effects of meteorological stations’ density and the interpolation method on the climate variables interpolation in the LP, we randomly twice selected 80% and 90% of the original meteorological stations respectively, and spatially interpolated these data by the GIDS method. Results have showed that the GIDS interpolated data closely matched with the observed data (Supplementary Fig.
