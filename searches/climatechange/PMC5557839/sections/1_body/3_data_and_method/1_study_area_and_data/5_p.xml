<p id="Par29" class="p">In order to characterize the land cover changes in the LP, we used the land cover maps in 2000, 2005, and 2010 with the resolution of 1 km for ET simulation. The maps were generated from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences

 </sup>. The China National Environmental Monitoring Center used historical U.S. Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper (TM/ETM) images from 2000 to 2010 and the missing scenes were supplemented by adopting the data before or after these years. In addition, the land cover types were further differentiated for the required International Geosphere-Biosphere Program (IGBP) land cover classification system, including evergreen needleleaf, evergreen broadleaf, deciduous needleleaf, deciduous broadleaf, mixed forest, shrub, grassland, permanent wetlands, crop, urban, bare or sparse vegetation cover, and open water (Fig.
