 </sup>. The annual average temperature is 9.0 °C with a minimum mean temperature of −4.6 °C in winter and a maximum annual temperature reaching to 20.9 °C in summer. Owing to the loose loess soils, steep slopes, periodic high intensity rainstorms and relatively sparse vegetation, the region is well-known for severe soil erosion and heavy sediment loads in the world. Besides, severe water shortages and limited natural conditions are also main obstacles for the sustainable development of this region
