<p id="Par30" class="p">Validation datasets include catchment streamflow and precipitation. In total, 15 largely unregulated catchments with a widespread geographic distribution were selected to assess model performance at the mean annual scale (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The annual streamflow data of the study period were obtained from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC). By assuming that the annual change of water storage was negligible in the long term, the mean annual ET over the period 2000–2012 for each catchment was calculated as the mean annual precipitation minus streamflow. In addition, the annual MODIS ET product (MOD16) with a spatial resolution of 1 km from 2000 to 2011 were valid
