<p id="Par40" class="p">The model performance in simulating ET used three criteria, i.e., root–mean –square-error (RMSE), the coefficient of determination (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and mean bias (bias). A simple regression model was used to investigate trends in annual ET and other variables (P, PET and LAI) for the period 2000–2012. The partial correlation coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) was calculated to show the strength of the ET-climate and the ET-LAI relations.
