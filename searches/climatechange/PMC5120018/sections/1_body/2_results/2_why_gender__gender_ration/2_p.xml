<p class="p">Finding how gendered differences affect responses to climate change impacts is the rationale behind the integration of gender in some studies. The most common rationales include the following: higher rates of death among poor women and children due to air pollution caused by household fuel (Venkataraman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2010</xref>); skipping meals and reducing food intake on a regular basis (Beaumier and Ford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2010</xref>); and socio-economic stresses and gendered health impacts (Dean and Stain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>). The role of women in producing and providing food for their households in areas at high risk of climate variations and conflict was also mentioned as an underlying principle for the relevance of gender (Cherotich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2012</xref>). The lack of women’s participation in development is an additional rationale for integrating gender analysis in the studies. Some studies justify the consideration of gender in climate change by citing the limitations on women’s participation in the implementation of adaptive strategies, e.g. due to their exclusion from access to land and water (Nation 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2010</xref>). Other studies justify the inclusion of gender in more general ways, such as by emphasizing the need to gain a deeper understanding of issues that are critical to community members (Cassidy and Barres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>), or the failure of previous interventions because of a lack of gender integration in their implementation (Nielsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2012</xref>). Few papers refer to women’s agency, active choices and engagement (Gabrielsson and Ramasar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2013</xref>; Jerneck and Olsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2013</xref>). Inequality in general, and the gender aspects of inequality, are seldom addressed sufficiently in the case studies. Only a very few papers use equity and rights-based arguments when examining gender integration (e.g. Onta and Resurrección 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2011</xref>).
