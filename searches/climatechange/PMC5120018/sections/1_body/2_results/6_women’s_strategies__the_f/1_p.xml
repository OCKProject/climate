<p class="p">Many papers indicate that men and women have different coping or adaptation strategies. Few papers focus on one specific adaptation activity, and suggest that men and women play different roles in the implementation of a given adaptation (Eriksen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2012</xref>). In Mozambique and Mali, migration was identified as a clearly male-dominated strategy (Silva et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2013</xref>). In South Africa, differences were reported in the strategies adopted by men and women. For instance, women were more informed than men in their agricultural choices, on issues such as suitable crops for home consumption and trade (Ziervogel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">2006</xref>). In Tanzania and Ethiopia, women were found to be less engaged in adaptation practices based on tree plantations (Deressa et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2012</xref>). Among teenagers psychologically affected by droughts in Australia, girls have significantly higher levels of prosocial behaviour than boys (Dean and Stain 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>). In Malawi, there are gender differences related to the choice of improved varieties, shifting of planting dates, irrigation farming, and income-generating activities (Pangapanga et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2012</xref>). In Cameroon, female-headed households are less likely to plant trees (as a protective measure) or rebuild homes (Molua 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). In Kenya, gum and resin collection is one of the most popular strategies adopted by women, children and impoverished people (Gachathi and Eriksen
