<p class="p">The diversification of livelihood activities is known to be an important strategy for reducing household vulnerability, particularly for activities that are not weather dependent. Several studies document the gender limitations to diversifying activities and livelihoods. However, the link between the available choices for different groups and gendered social roles and norms has not been well assessed. Few studies refer to context-specific, cultural limitations or to the options that women and female-headed households are culturally allowed to choose and implement. The prevalence of socially driven gender inequity is reflected in the relatively limited choices and strategies that many women feel that they are allowed to adopt. Some studies document that female-headed households are often constrained to engaging in low-benefit, low-risk activities, due to their exclusion from high-benefit, low-risk activities, such as formal employment, which are mostly male dominated (West et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). Djoudi and Brockhaus (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2011</xref>) suggest that long-term strategies for women are based on education and formal employment, but that short-term community strategies hinder them from making the shift away from high-risk, low-benefit strategies. Education seems to ensure access to better incomes and provide access to other assets required to adapt, as many studies suggest. The probability of selecting resilient pathways is highest for an educated, middle-aged, male farmer, while female-headed households face significant socio-economic and cultural constraints, which limit their ability to choose resilient strategies (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2008</xref>; Molua 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). Pastoralism and migration are both important strategies in several drought-prone regions, and are more resilient strategies than rainfall-dependent agriculture. Both sectors are mostly male dominated (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2008</xref>; Brockhaus et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>).
