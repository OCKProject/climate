<p class="p">According to several papers, migration is a male-dominated strategy expected to impact gender relationships. The question of whether the migration of men has a negative or positive impact on gender relationships is controversial and certainly context dependent (Hecht et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2015</xref>). Some studies have documented the impacts of migration on the feminization of traditionally male-dominated sectors, for instance, livestock and pastoralism. The livestock mix follows a trend towards a greater number of small ruminants and fewer cattle (Sungno Niggol and Mendelsohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156" class="xref">2006</xref>). This trend is associated with drought-related adaptation and results in more women being involved in the livestock sector (Turner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155" class="xref">1999</xref>). This is a good example of how the strategies of men, in a context of unequal decision making, can have gender-mixed and complex outcomes. Hence, further studies are required to examine the feminization of male-dominated sectors, as a result of coping and adaptation strategies.
