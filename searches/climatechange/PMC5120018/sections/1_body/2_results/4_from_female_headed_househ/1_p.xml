<p class="p">A large number of vulnerability papers agree that assets and context promote vulnerability and barriers to adaptation for women. We found that most articles that analyse vulnerabilities at the local level use a female-headed household approach. The sampling is mostly random, and the analyses use the proportion of female-headed households to male-headed households. The greater vulnerability of female-headed households is shown in few studies (Cassidy and Barres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>; Maponya and Mpandeli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2012</xref>; Safi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2012</xref>). Different factors are identified to explain the greater vulnerability of female-headed households. Generally, female heads of household are found to have a lower level of education than male heads of household. The gender and level of education of the head of household are closely correlated, and are cited as a possible explanation for differences in vulnerability (Deressa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2009</xref> Below et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2012</xref>). Other studies argue that a lack of formal education and the social standing of female heads of household were found to limit access to credit (Below et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2012</xref>; Banerjee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>) and to increase therefore the female-headed households’ vulnerability. In some studies, female-headed households experience greater vulnerability because, in contrast to most male-headed households, they usually lack reliable, non-farm income (Eriksen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2005</xref>; Antwi-Agyei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>). Female-headed households are also often on the edges of their community’s social network, which limits their engagement in resilient livelihood strategies and which was found to impact on the resilience of the entire household (Cassidy and Barres 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, the existing evidence on the comparative vulnerability of female- and male-headed households is not sufficient to draw strong conclusions that one is worse-off or better-off than the other. In particular, the heterogeneity of the vulnerability context considered in the studies is a limiting factor for unambiguous and strong conclusions.
