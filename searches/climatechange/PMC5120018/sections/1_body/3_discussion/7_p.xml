<p class="p">Although most studies carried out interviews (mostly with female- vs. male-headed households) and participatory workshops, their conclusions on gender are mainly based on household surveys. In some cases, gender-relevant qualitative information gathered through participatory workshops was not included in the papers’ conclusions. Most recommendations were aimed at the community or household level, and called for: greater assistance for female-headed households; targeted climate adaptation policies and programmes to enhance asset building and increase the capacity of vulnerable households to engage in more resilient non-farm activities (Antwi-Agyei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2012</xref>); and greater financial inclusion and access to formal systems of finance (Banerjee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). Many studies also recommended the improvement of education systems to provide equal opportunities for women, and the strengthening of social capital, agricultural extension, microcredit services, and access to information (Below et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kisauzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2012</xref>). Very few studies called for approaches and strategies that recognize people’s agency (Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition to this, very few papers called for greater understanding of intra-household vulnerability and vulnerability dynamics (Nation 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2010</xref>), or targeted a specific group of vulnerable women at the household level in their recommendations (Gabrielsson and Ramasar 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2013</xref>). Those papers, that did, concluded that policymakers and practitioners must consider the intra-household distribution of labour and resources, as well as agricultural and other household activities, in order to understand women’s vulnerabilities and adaptation processes. Wilk and Kgathi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2007</xref>) conclude their study by highlighting that there are both social and spatial differences in risk and these need to be better understood by policy makers in order to better target initiatives. Jerneck and Olsson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2013</xref>) call for inclusive and participatory processes, which reconsider and act upon the underlying, structural layers of poverty and the need for broader policies on social change.
