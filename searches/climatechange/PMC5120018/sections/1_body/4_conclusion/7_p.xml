<p class="p">In this sense, we argue that gaps identified by this study related to the lack of intersectional approaches as well as to a lack of power relation analysis in the climate change debate can be addressed by a stronger inclusion of feminist theory into the field of climate change (Sultana 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2014</xref>). In the words of MacGregor (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2010</xref>, p. 137), “It is also important that materialist-informed empirical research be complemented by critical feminist theorizing of non-material and discursive aspects of climate change”. The concept of gender and climate change needs to “challenge embedded assumptions about gender and power”, and to make “new alliances out of old divisions” (Cornwall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2003</xref>, p. 1325). Furthermore, it needs to move beyond adjustment measures by contextualized understanding of mutual fragility (Tschakert and Machado 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2012</xref>) towards an inclusive and transformational culture and practices. If we ignore the social and political foundations that have contributed to climate change vulnerability and the ensuing climate change crisis (Wainwright 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151" class="xref">2010</xref>), potential solutions will enhance rather than reduce existing injustices, and societies risk missing the opportunity to address the critical challenges of climate change.
