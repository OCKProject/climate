<p class="p"> In the fields of vulnerability analysis, it is crucial, in Lykke’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2009</xref>, p. 43) words, “to bring more forcefully the issues of complicity, tensions and conflicting interests not only between ‘the vulnerable’ and hegemonic powers, but also among ‘the vulnerable’ themselves”. Recent climate change studies highlight that: “Women are once again being singled out as climate victims” or are usually framed as “victims or stewards” (Arora-Jonsson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160" class="xref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, simplistic dichotomies fail to capture the range of complexities and the power dynamics of vulnerability. This is often because “women’s identities are projected as fixed, centred, and uniform” (Resurrección 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157" class="xref">2013</xref>, p. 1), ignoring that other factors like age, wealth, class and ethnic affiliation are often crucial (Djoudi and Bockhaus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2011</xref>). Earlier feminist work, for instance Tuana (
