<p class="p">Drawing on a long history of feminist approaches, in intersectional analysis, the relational nature of power is important, since the same subject can experience both power and oppression simultaneously (Collins 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">1990</xref>). Intersectionality calls for a nuanced analysis of power “that includes not only power over others, but also power with others” (Hankivsky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>, p. 36). Furthermore, this author argues that intersectionality calls on us to move beyond the ‘Oppression Olympics‘, a term used by Martinez (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">1993</xref>) to describe the “competition between different groups for the title of ‘most oppressed’, in order to gain support, economic resources, and recognition” (Hankivsky 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>, p. 36). Through the examination of the intersecting factors and conditions by which power is not only produced, reproduced but also actively resisted, intersectionality calls for a more complex approach to address the system that creates power differentials, rather than the symptoms of it (Hancock 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2007</xref>). Hence, from an intersectional point of view, power structures in a specific social categorization system determine how individuals relate and react to climate change (Kaijser and Kronsell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2014</xref>). Furthermore, intersectionality enables people and communities to express and experience their own capacity because it creates a pathway of analysis enabling “agency across and beyond social categories” (Kaijser and Kronsell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2014</xref>, p. 417).
