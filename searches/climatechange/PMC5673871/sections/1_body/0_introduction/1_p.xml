<p id="Par3" class="p">It is difficult to predict future development of Arctic marine ecosystems and, even more so, how these are affected by human interactions. Immediate effects of such interactions are not only functions of the level and profile of the human activity but also of current state and dynamics of the natural system. Spatial and temporal distributions of prey and predator species vary, depending both on external drivers (e.g. climate and fisheries; Murawski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1993</xref>) and internal dynamics (e.g. spawning migrations; Rose 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">1993</xref>; Carvalho 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1993</xref>). Long-term effects are by nature more difficult to predict than short-term perturbations, being functions of previous interactions and poorly known dynamics causing variations in spatial and temporal distributions of the system.
