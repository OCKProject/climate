<p id="Par6" class="p">When looking at the exploitation of the cod (
 <italic class="italic">Gadus morhua</italic>) stock in the Barents Sea, the resilience of the Northern cod fishery is confirmed by archaeological fishbone analyses (Barrett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2008</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2011</xref>) showing that dried cod continuously has been exported from the remote sub-Arctic region to other European countries over a period of more than thousand years. This period includes both the Medieval Warm Period (about 900–1400, Stocker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2013</xref>), with significantly warmer climate than today, and the Little Ice Age (1450–1850, Stocker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2013</xref>), which we temperature wise still are recovering from (Bianchi and McCave
