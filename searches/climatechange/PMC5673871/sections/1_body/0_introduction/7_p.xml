<p id="Par9" class="p">Given the difficulties of fully understanding the system dynamics in its natural state, the difficulties of predicting the effects of a possible system perturbation caused by climate change become even more challenging. But more so, also observing the actual configurations of a marine ecosystem or mapping its recent history in all details is virtually impossible. The aim of this paper therefore is not to predict or forecast the NEA cod fishery under the two scenarios but rather to present possible outcomes within the sample spaces of the two scenarios (which certainly turn out to also have large overlapping areas, though not being the focus of this study). The climate scenario is based on the IPCC AR4 SRES A1B scenario (Anon. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2007</xref>) which at that time (2007) was considered being reasonably realistic. The A1 storyline assumes political focus on economics rather than environmental issues and a globalised economy. Among the different scenarios within the A1 family, the A1B scenario assumes a balanced development of energy technologies. The recent assessment report indicates that the A1B scenario may be too optimistic and less realistic than first anticipated (Stocker et al.
