 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, particularly after the shift in carrying capacity where stock biomasses, catches and seasonal peaks clearly are lower in open access fishery. At high smartness levels and open access fishery, monthly available biomasses and obtained catches in peak season even reach higher levels in the zero scenario than that in the A1B scenario.
