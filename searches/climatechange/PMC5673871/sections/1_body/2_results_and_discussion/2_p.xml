 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows monthly samples of biomass distribution outputs for all simulations over a period of 2 years (2030 and 2031), indicating how both scenarios follow the seasonal pattern in the cod stock available for exploitation. The expected season profile is displayed as a thick yellow curve, drawn from the mathematical expression for the season profile found in Eide et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2003</xref>). The variations indicated by each Box–Whisker item show the monthly variation within the 24 simulations performed within each of the two scenarios where the blue bars represent the zero scenario and the red bars the A1B scenario.
