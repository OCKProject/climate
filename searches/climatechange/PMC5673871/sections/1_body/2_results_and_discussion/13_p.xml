The stock distribution in terms of centres of gravity turns out to be very stable, almost not affected of fishing intensity and levels of smartness. A slight North-eastern movement is indicated for the A1B scenario compared with the zero scenario but the main impression is that the stock biomass distribution does not change. In the case of open access, the two scenarios are practically equal in terms of stock biomass distribution.
