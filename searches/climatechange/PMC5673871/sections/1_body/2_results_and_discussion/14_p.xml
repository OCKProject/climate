<p id="Par58" class="p">Significantly larger changes are seen in the distribution of fishing effort, also reflecting the changing fleet compositions due to stock properties, exploitation levels and smartness. At increasing levels of smartness, there is a light tendency towards a more South-western distribution of fishing effort in both scenarios, even for the A1B scenario where the stock distribution slightly moves in the opposite direction. This indicates that the effect of reducing cost related to distance from port may be a more important factor than the possibly more North-eastern stock distribution.</p>
