The seasonal profiles of the two scenarios follow to a large degree the same pattern up to the mid-thirties after which a significantly higher stock biomass appears in the cases of an exploitation rate based on a fishing mortality rate (

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) in both scenarios. The effect of the shift in environmental carrying capacity is however reflected in increased monthly catches also in the case of

 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 0.2 and
