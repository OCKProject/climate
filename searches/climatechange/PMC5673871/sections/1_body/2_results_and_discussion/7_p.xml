<p id="Par51" class="p">Open access fishery combined with high smartness levels results in higher profits in the zero scenario than in the A1B scenario throughout the simulation period. At lower smartness levels, however, the profit surface area within the open access area reaches surprisingly high levels as seen in the lower-right table in Fig.

 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 2 is close to the maximum overall profit (at 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 0.2 and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 5). In general, the A1B scenario seems to give relatively larger benefits to higher smartness levels than the zero scenario does. In both cases, highest profits are found at the fishing mortality rate (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>) 0.2 but while the smartness level in A1B scenario maximum is 5 it is 1.5 in the zero scenario.
