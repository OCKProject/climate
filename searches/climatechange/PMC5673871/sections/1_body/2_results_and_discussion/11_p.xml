<p id="Par55" class="p">The fact that the high sea fleet has a wider range than the coastal fleet may be the simple explanation of the higher diversity at high levels of exploitation. The advantage of a higher mobility combined with a minimum level of fishing aptitude becomes relatively a more important advantage as the exploitation level increases. As seen in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>, however, also the diversity of the high sea fleet may decrease at sufficiently high smartness levels when the exploitation level is high, while the decline in fleet diversity occurs at lower exploitation levels in the coastal fleet. It should however be noted that this picture may be completely reversed when including alternative fisheries which first of all provide the coastal fleet with different options that could contribute to a higher fleet diversity.
