In these cases, the lowest exploitation level and low smartness levels cluster independent of climate scenario. It seems also to be a combined clustering tendency for both scenarios at higher exploitation levels and higher smartness levels, suggesting that the distribution of effort and hence catches is more depending on smartness levels and fishing intensities than marginal changes in the distribution of stock biomasses.
