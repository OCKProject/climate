<p id="Par56" class="p">At low s-values in open access, the fleet diversities of the two scenarios are virtually identical. Overall, the highest fleet diversities are found at low exploitation levels and high smartness levels. The fleet diversities of the two scenarios follow each other closely but from the zero to the A1B scenario, the tendency is increasing diversity in the coastal fleet at low smartness while it is the high sea vessel diversity which increases at high smartness levels.</p>
