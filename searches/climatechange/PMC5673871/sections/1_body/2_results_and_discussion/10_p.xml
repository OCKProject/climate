<p id="Par54" class="p">The declining diversity for small-scale vessels at higher smartness values and exploitation rates is also clearly visible in Fig.

In Fig.

 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 04) and for s-values higher than 1.5, all points lay above the diagonal and hence indicate that the high sea fleet is more diverse than the coastal fleet.
