As higher values of the diversity index indicate higher diversity, clearly the coastal fleet exhibits the highest diversity at low exploitation levels and for low smartness values at all levels of exploitation. The two scenarios follow the same pattern in this respect and also regarding the trends while increasing smartness levels. As higher smartness levels seem to contribute in increased fleet diversity for the high sea vessels (for exploitation rates at 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 0.2 and above), the opposite is the case for the coastal fleet, though not so pronounced at 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 0.2 as for the highest exploitation levels. Although the fleet diversity for high smartness levels and open access seems to drop below the corresponding levels of the zero scenario and the opposite for 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 0.4, the general impression is that the fleet diversity in the A1B scenario corresponds very closely to the fleet diversities found in the zero scenario simulations.
