<p id="Par22" class="p">When having established the cellular automata lattice with cell-specific carrying capacities, which develop according to environmental variables and observed distributional pattern in the cod population, the next step is to establish cellular automata distributional rules. Essentially, the rules describe how individual cod moves in terms of directions and distances within the time frame of 1 month. According to Rose et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">1995</xref>), NEA cod may have a range between 210 and 720 km over a period of 30 days, indicating that three cells in all direction from a given cell in a 80 × 80 km grid represent a reasonable range (range = 2, assuming Moore neighbourhood).
