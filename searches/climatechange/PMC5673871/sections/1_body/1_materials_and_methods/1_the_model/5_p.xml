<p id="Par16" class="p">The data sample from the period 2004 to 2010 was considered to represent the current environmental situation, rather than reflecting ongoing changes in climate. There are several reasons for this. The period is rather short and the datasets, although displaying significant variations in the distributional patterns, do not show any significant trends or systematic changes. The seasonal variations are extreme but the seasonal biomass centres of gravity are almost identical each year during the period. In terms of weighted biomass distances for each quarter during the time period from a given geographical point (in the calculations the coordinates of Troms√∏ was chosen), cluster analyses did not reveal any systematic changes and different years constituted the main cluster for each of the four quarters.</p>
