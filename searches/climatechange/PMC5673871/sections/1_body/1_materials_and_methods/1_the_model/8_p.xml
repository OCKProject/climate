 <italic class="italic">SinMod</italic> datasets of bathymetry, temperatures and zooplankton biomasses over the simulation period, representing the changes in environmental carrying capacities corresponding to the A1B scenario. As stochastic element is added to estimated environmental carrying capacities. As the mean deviation of the carrying capacity of each cell varies between 20 and 30 % (following the seasonal pattern of cod availability) during the period of observations (2004–2010), a normally distributed stochastic element with a mean value of one and a standard deviation of 10 % is assumed. The stochastic element also serves to establish the zero scenario monthly carrying capacities, repeating the current climate with the minor perturbations caused by the stochastic process.
