<p id="Par24" class="p">The shifting carrying capacity distributions constitute the model environment and mimic the changes both in the physical and biological environment in which the cod stock lives, defining rich areas allowing the cod stock to expand and poor areas in which saturation levels are reached at low biomass levels. By affecting the distribution of biomasses also the migration pattern is affected, even though the cellular automata distribution rules are fixed for the whole simulation period (Eide
