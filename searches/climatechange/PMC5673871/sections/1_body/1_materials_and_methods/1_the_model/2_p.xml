 <italic class="italic">CAb</italic> follows a normal set up with a uniform lattice of squared cells (80 × 80 km) with rules based on a Moore neighbourhood of range two. Each cell is defined in terms of geographical coordinates and the state variable of the cell is the cod biomass in the water column at the geographical position of the cell. Hence, the spatial distribution of the cod biomass at one point in time is given by the matrix of state variables in the lattice. According to the definition of Moore neighbourhoods (Hogeweg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">1988</xref>) the rules are given as the percentwise distribution of the mid cell of a 5 × 5 cells matrix into all the 25 cells (at range = 2). With a time unit of 1 month, the cod distribution is recalculated monthly on basis of the current state variables, month-specific rules and the cell-specific growth properties. Biomass within each cell grows linearly towards the environmental carrying capacity level at which local stock collapse occurs so that only the fractional part of the biomass is left (while standardising the carrying capacity level to one). The natural mortality in the model is mainly covered by these local collapses, depending on monthly variation in carrying capacity levels and biomass levels in each cell after redistribution of biomass and biomass growth.
