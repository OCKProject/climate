<p id="Par19" class="p">Spatial and temporal distributions of the NEA cod environmental carrying capacity levels for each scenario have been estimated on the basis of constraining physical and biological factors in addition to the observed distributional patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The NEA cod distribution as assumed to be constrained to ocean depths less than thousand metres and ocean temperatures higher than −1.5 °C (the monthly average at 50 m depths) (Eide

In addition, a cell’s environmental carrying capacity is reduced by 80 % when small zooplankton densities fall below 2 g carbon per square metre, considering the density of small zooplankton being a proxy for food availability in the area.
