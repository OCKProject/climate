<p id="Par44" class="p">This study investigates and compares distribution and variability in the two scenarios, in particular emphasising fleet diversity and spatial distribution of the fishing activity. While previous studies (Eide

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2008</xref>) suggest that fisheries management may have a greater impact than climate change on the biological development and economic performance of Arctic groundfish fisheries, these studies did however not include spatial distributions of biomasses and fishing effort.
