<p id="Par23" class="p">The rules should in principle be able to move the cod biomasses over time according to previous observations. This boils down to a straight forward statistical problem minimising the sum of squared distances between the observed centres of gravity in the observed cod biomass and the centres of gravity in the by rule distributed cod biomass (described in detail in Eide 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2016</xref>). The best model fit is indicated by the red cells in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, while the observed centres of gravity (based on surveys and catch information) are shown as blue cells in the same figure. The minimised sum of squares of the 12 observations equals 6.62 (measured in square units) within a distribution of monthly centres of gravity spanning over 8 (horizontally) times 2 (vertically) cells (Eide 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>). This means that the rules perform sufficiently well in replicating observed migratory pattern in the NEA cod stock. The rules are month specific and identical for all cells for each month.
