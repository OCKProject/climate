 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> displays the total NEA cod environmental carrying capacity anomalies of the two scenarios throughout the simulation period. The A1B scenario is essentially as presented in Eide (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>) while the zero scenario is defined as repeated sequences of the first 6 years of the A1B scenario which is presented in Eide (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2016</xref>). Both the zero and the A1B scenario show ±10 % fluctuations related to the base year (2012), while the A1B scenario (upper panel in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) in the mid 2030s displays a shift upwards, resulting in almost a 10 % increase in carrying capacity compared with the base year.
