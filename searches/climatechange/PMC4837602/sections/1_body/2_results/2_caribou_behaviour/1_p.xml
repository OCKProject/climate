<p class="p">Of the 181 individual-years monitored, 95 (52 individuals) used the vicinity (i.e., surfaces and 5-km buffer zones) of the largest water bodies in the study area. These individuals performed 179 ice crossings, 11 water crossings, and 129 detours. The longest crossing was recorded on reservoir Robert-Bourassa, when a caribou walked on ice for ~30 h over a &gt;60 km distance. The caribou with the longest swimming distance swam across Lake Bienville over a &gt;25 km distance. Based on MODIS maps, ice was completely unavailable during this crossing, which occurred on October 19
