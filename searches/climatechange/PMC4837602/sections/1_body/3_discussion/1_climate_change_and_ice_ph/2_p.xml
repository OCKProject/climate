<p class="p">Contrary to Magnuson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], we did not detect any significant icing trend on the largest water bodies used by caribou in Northern Québec (2000–2014) and Lake Nichicun (1947–1985). This study was based on a different methodology and used data collected over much broader spatial (i.e., Northern Hemisphere) and temporal (i.e., 19
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century onwards) scales. In comparison, our compilation of 15 years of MODIS data may have been insufficient to detect a significant trend. Broad scale predictive models usually outperform finer climatic models because of their capacity to capture a larger range of variability [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Other reports on local freshwater ice conditions have also demonstrated the difficulty of studying ice phenology at fine scales [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. Latifovic and Pouliot [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>] found that, out of 36 lakes monitored across Canada from 1950 to 2004, 33 had earlier breakup and 24 had later freezing dates, but only 45 % and 42 % of these trends were statistically significant, respectively. The lack of additional long-term data on ice availability in our study area prevented us from performing more precise analyses.
