<p class="p">Caribou swim at the water surface using quadrupedal paddling, which is amongst the least efficient types of swim in vertebrates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. To cover a given distance, humans spend approximately four times more energy in water than on land, and go half as fast [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. It is probable that the comparative costs of swimming vs. running for caribou are similar to those of humans, if not higher, due to the low propulsive surface area of their finer limbs. Thus, the avoidance of water and selection of ice by caribou could be largely explained by locomotion energetics.
