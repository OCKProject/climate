<p class="p">Thus, it is not just a strong tradition of scientific efforts in such focused programs that the NIEHS brings to the table, but also a constantly growing knowledge base in a broad array of relevant fields including air pollution and allergies, toxic contamination, developmental origins of health and disease, health disparities, and postdisaster research and response, to name a few. Work in these areas is directly applicable to understanding and anticipating the effects of climate change on children. For example, knowledge of how the body’s mechanisms respond to air pollutants such as particulate matter and ozone can inform the potential for climate change to exacerbate asthma—a huge health burden among children, particularly urban minority and other disadvantaged children. An ever-expanding comprehension of the effects of pesticide exposures on children’s growth and development can be brought to bear on climate change issues such as predicting impacts of increased toxic exposures from extreme weather events, as well as changes in food production and security, particularly among indigenous cultures. New research that implicates exposure of pregnant mothers to floods as a potential factor in negative birth outcomes, the effects of which can extend into childhood and beyond, may benefit from the findings of research on the developmental origins of health and disease. And efforts to learn how best to quickly identify and respond to health impacts in the aftermath of disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and storms—all of which are expected to become more frequent and severe with climate change—may help to guide how we protect children from and improve their resilience to such events.</p>
