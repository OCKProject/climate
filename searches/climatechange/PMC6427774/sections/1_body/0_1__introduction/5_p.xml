<p class="p">Malaria is often referred to as a climate-dependent disease, which is primarily because a certain sum of temperatures is needed for the complete maturation of sporozoites in mosquitoes. 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium vivax</italic> requires lower temperatures for its development in the vector than other human malaria species. At temperatures between 16 째C and 18 째C, 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> would develop, albeit slowly, whereas the development of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> is possible only at 18 째C and above. 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> used to be widespread in Europe, including the southernmost areas of Russia. In warm years, it could spread in Russia even up to 61째 N [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, the Palaearctic variety of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> had been probably eliminated throughout Europe by the end of the 1950s. The importation of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> from elsewhere is arguably impossible, because the mosquitoes of the Palaearctic region are insusceptible to 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> varieties from the Afrotropical and Oriental regions [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Therefore, we discuss here the climatic conditions favoring the possible reintroduction of 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> only, and leave the question of 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> beyond the scope of this work.
