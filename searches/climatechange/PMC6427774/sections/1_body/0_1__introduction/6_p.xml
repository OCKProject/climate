<p class="p">Malaria vectors are much more resistant to low temperatures than malaria parasites. Temperature affects the bionomics of 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, such as the speed of development of the aquatic stages (which depends on the temperature of the place of breeding), the speed of blood digestion (which depends on the temperature of the resting place), and their survival in general [

However, the minimum temperature requirements of malaria parasites during the extrinsic part of the cycle are significantly higher than those of the mosquitoes. For example, aquatic stages of the principal malaria vector in the Palaearctic region, 
 <italic class="italic">A. maculipennis s.l</italic>, require no less than +10 °C, and adults actively feed at this temperature, whereas stages of 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> in mosquitoes die out at temperatures below 16 °C. This was the explanation of the phenomenon of “anophelism without malaria” that puzzled European malariologists in the 1920s and 1930s [
