<p class="p">Human malaria is a group of four infections caused by protozoan parasites of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium</italic> and transmitted by anopheline mosquitoes. On a global scale, practically all cases of malaria are caused by either 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic>. The former is the predominant of the two (
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 90%). The share of infections caused by human parasites 
 <italic class="italic">P. malariae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. ovale</italic> is negligible. Humans occasionally become infected with 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodium</italic> species that normally infect animals, such as 
 <italic class="italic">P. knowlesi</italic>. As of yet, there are no reports of human–mosquito–human transmission of such zoonotic species of malaria [

 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], as well as their own features of pathology, epidemiology, public health significance, and amenability to control.
