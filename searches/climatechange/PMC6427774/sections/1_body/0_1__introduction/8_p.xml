<p class="p">Malaria transmission occurs both in rural and urban areas, although the rural environment is, as a rule (but not always), more favorable for malaria [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The reasons for this are not the same in the tropics and in temperate/subtropical areas. Generally, conditions for urban malaria are less favorable due to the paucity of suitable breeding places and widespread pollution, to which anophelines are much more sensitive than other mosquitoes. On the other hand, the urban areas are usually significantly warmer (by up to 2 to 3 Â°C) than their rural surroundings due to specific land-cover modifications and anthropogenic factors. Such a temperature anomaly, which is known as an urban heat island effect [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], may favor the transmission of malaria. The magnitude of the urban heat islands is comparable with the magnitude of the observed climate changes. The latter allows suggesting the significant effect of the urban temperature anomaly on the climate favorability for malaria transmission.
