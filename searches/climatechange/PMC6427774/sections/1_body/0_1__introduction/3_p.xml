Importation of malaria became a problem again after the dissolution of the Union of the Soviet Socialist republics (USSR), which triggered epidemics of vivax malaria in a number of former member states, including Tajikistan and Azerbaijan in particular. During the post-Soviet epoch, the local transmission of malaria in Russia followed ups and downs of malaria in Asiatic ex-members of USSR, with a lag of about two years [

An upsurge of malaria in post-Soviet states provoked secondary transmission in Russia, which happened due to the importation of malaria by migrants and often coincided with hot summer weather. From 1996 to 2009, there was a wave of transmission with more than 700 autochthonous cases. After that, only five episodic autochthonous cases occurred within Russia (
