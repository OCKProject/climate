<p class="p">There is a tendency for the entire Moscow region for a shift of the date of the beginning of the SEI to an earlier date, but the significance of these trends is small. In the rural areas, on the average, this date advanced by 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = −6 days/10 years (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.16, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.013). In other words, the average date of the beginning of the SET was the first week of June at the beginning of the 40-year observation period, and the last week of May at the end. Within the limits of Moscow city, the SEI always starts earlier than in the rural areas; the southern parts of Moscow 
 <italic class="italic">oblast’</italic> are also marked by earlier dates. However, the spatial variability is not so great, with the maximum differences within the whole of the area not exceeding nine days.
