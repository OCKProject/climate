<p class="p">Balchug station in the city center has consistently demonstrated the longest SEI duration compared with all other stations (67.1 days on the average for the whole period of 40 years). However, in contrast to the sum of ET, the tendencies to increase the duration of the season in the city center are less pronounced than those in the rural areas (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> = 8.2 days/10 years, which is less than in any of the stations considered;

It is probable that a further increase in the duration of the SEI becomes impossible, since the SEI occupies most of the warm period of the year anyway, due to the influence of the urban heat island. In other words, the longer the SEI, the less is the sensitivity of malaria to further climate warming. This pattern, though with some exceptions, is also shown by rural stations.
