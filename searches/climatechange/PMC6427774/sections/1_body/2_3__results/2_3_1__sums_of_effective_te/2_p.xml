<p class="p">The following salient points should be noted:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Sums of ETs for the city center remain well above the average rural values every year, whereas the values for the park zones stay in between the two.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">For the city center, temperatures allowed the full development of at least one generation of sporozoites every year. For individual rural stations, there were years when the temperatures remained below the threshold of 105 °C, i.e., the temperatures were insufficient to ensure the transmission of 
    <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic>. The average rural values moved below the threshold only twice, in 1978 and in 1984 (before 1977 not shown on the graph); there were regular cases of years when temperatures remained prohibitive to the development of the parasite.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">There was a growing trend of sums of ETs, especially after 1997. For average rural values, the coefficient of the linear trend 
    <italic class="italic">k</italic> equals 65 °C/10 years, which is statistically significant (
    <italic class="italic">R</italic>
    <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.31, 
    <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). This trend is further emphasized by the sums of ETs reaching below the threshold only once after 1997, in the year 2015, and in one place, i.e., in Volokolamsk (which is known as a “cold” station, where this indicator is always lower than in the other points).

  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The growth rate of the sums of ET for the urban stations exceeded the growth rate in the rural stations: the trend slope coefficient and its significance for these two stations was greater than for the rural ones, revealing the intensification of the urban heat island.</p>
