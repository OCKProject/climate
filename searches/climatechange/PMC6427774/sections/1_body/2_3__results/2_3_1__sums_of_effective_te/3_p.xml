Here, the average values of the sums of ET are shown by shadings, and the tempo of their increase during the 40-year period is shown by the size of the circles (a similar approach is applied further for the other two indicators in figures 8 and 10). A marked spatial heterogeneity may be seen, with the values being consistently higher in Moscow city and in the eastern parts of the region. For Moscow city, this may be explained by the effect of the urban heat island; for the east of Moscow region, by the rise in the continentality of the climate: west to east, the winters grow colder, but summers are hotter. At the same time, the rate of change of the indicator is more significant in the central and western parts of the region.
