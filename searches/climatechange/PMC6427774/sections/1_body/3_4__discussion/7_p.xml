They believed that, according to some scenarios, malaria epidemic belt may shift northward over centralâ€“northern Europe, Russia, northern Asia, and northern America. It is specially highlighted in their work that the results of such prognoses are quite uncertain due to differences in the initial malaria impact models that were selected for the prognosis, especially over the periphery of the malaria distribution range. Unfortunately, in this paper the authors regarded malaria as a single entity, ignoring the differences in the temperature requirements of particular parasite species, which may have invalidated their prognosis.
