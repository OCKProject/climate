<p class="p">There has been a considerable number of studies on the influence of climatic change on the future malaria situation. They are based on various prognostic scenarios that appear more or less realistic. For instance, Lindsay et al. [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] provided risk maps indicating the territory that was climatically suitable for vivax malaria distribution, which nowadays includes central and southern England. This territory will probably increase in extent in the future, reaching southwestern Scotland by 2030. According to this scenario, in some places in southern England, the duration of malaria transmission season may exceed three to four months.
