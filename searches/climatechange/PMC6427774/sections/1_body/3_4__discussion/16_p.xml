<p class="p">For rural areas, conditions are more favorable in relation to malaria in the south than in the north of the 
 <italic class="italic">oblast</italic>’, which is due to the general warming of the climate in southern direction. At the same time, the conditions are more favorable in the east than in the west, due to a more continental climate in the east. As a result of the interaction of these factors, the thermal conditions for malaria are more favorable in the city of Moscow and least favorable in the western and northern parts of the Moscow 
 <italic class="italic">oblast</italic>’.
