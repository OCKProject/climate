<p class="p">The real danger of occasional outbreaks following the importation of malaria was demonstrated in a recent episode of vivax malaria transmission in Greece [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Climate change may act as a trigger factor for malaria reintroduction in countries with insufficient malaria surveillance, uncontrolled migrations, and a lack of malaria awareness among health professionals and travelers. Van Lieshout et al. [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] considered Russia among the “countries where malaria remains at a low level despite poor control efforts” with previously “effective control program [having] declined in recent years”. In the authors’ view, such countries may be migrating toward a high malaria status, and it is unlikely that they will have “the structural or economic capacity to cope with any increases in malaria that climate change will bring”. In this regard, it can be concluded that the authors consider climate change to be an important cause of the deterioration of malaria status. However, we feel that malaria control in Russia, in fact, has been quite reasonable in the past, and has not changed much in strategy and scope since the period of massive importation of malaria from Afghanistan in the 1980s. This “low level” was an achievement by itself in view of an unprecedented influx of infected individuals from Tajikistan and Azerbaijan experiencing severe epidemics at that time, which was aggravated by climatic change.
