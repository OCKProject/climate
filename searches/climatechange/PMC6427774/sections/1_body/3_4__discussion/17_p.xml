<p class="p">Besides the increase in the favorability of climatic conditions for malaria parasites, warming may also affect the vector populations. The phenology of urban mosquitoes demonstrates a shift to earlier terms comparing rural and suburban areas, and this was associated with an urban heat island effect, which raised urban air and water temperatures [

 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> doesn’t lead to any deterioration of the malaria situation. This is because malaria transmission is limited by the thermal requirements of the parasite, which are narrower than those of the vector. This is often ignored by some researchers who have equated the climate-driven vectors’ range transformations and the changes in potential malaria range [
