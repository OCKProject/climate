<p class="p">In order to take into account those marginal situations when the probability of the transmission is slightly above zero, we propose the following integral index of favorability of thermal conditions, which is based on the assumptions that in order to complete one infection turnover (from the ingestion of gametocytes by a mosquito to the mosquito becoming infective), no less than a sum of effective temperatures (ET) of 105 °C is required. When it happens, this may generate a small number of secondary cases, but for the transmission to become established, another round of maturation of sporozoites would be required. In other words, no less than 210 °C would be needed (that is notwithstanding that at least additional 10 days would be needed for an infected person to generate gametocytes, but since this span is temperature-independent, it cannot be absorbed into the model).</p>
