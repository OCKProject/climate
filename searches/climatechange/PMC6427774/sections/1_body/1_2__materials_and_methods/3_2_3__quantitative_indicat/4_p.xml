<p class="p">The timing of events of the malaria season gives a useful basis for comparisons and forecast for malaria control in those situations in which the transmission is deemed possible. However, this approach does not differentiate between situations in which the above calculations indicate that the transmission seems impossible. In fact, when the calculations predict the impossibility of the transmission, this may be accounted for by different circumstances. There would be occasions when the probability of the maturation of sporozoites is definitively zero (say, if ADT does not reach 16Â° all over the period). On the other hand, there would be occasions when the sums of temperatures come very near to the required values. On such occasions, due to the spatial variation of microclimatic conditions, in which mosquitoes dwell during their incessant journeys between the feeding and breeding places (which may be only coarsely appreciated by the temperatures at the meteorological stations), vectors may occasionally find themselves in warmer conditions than those predicted by the records. As a result, the maturation of sporozoites may occasionally take place, despite the prediction.</p>
