   <p class="p">Season of manifestations: the period of the year during which most malaria manifestations start. It begins before the activity of mosquitoes, since a significant proportion of vivax malaria cases occurs nine to 12 months after the inoculation due to the long latency period [

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Season of effective infectiveness of mosquitoes (SEI): the period during which a mosquito infected on a person can generate mature sporozoites. It starts at the same moment as SET, but stops earlier; this is because mosquitoes that contracted parasites nearer to the end of the SEI do not have enough time at a favorable temperature to generate fully developed parasites (the infection of mosquitoes is not effective in this case).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Malaria transmission season: the period during which mosquitoes with mature sporozoites can infect humans. It starts later than the SEI by the lag equal to the duration of the period for development of a single generation of sporozoites, which may take three to four weeks at the beginning of the warm period.</p>
