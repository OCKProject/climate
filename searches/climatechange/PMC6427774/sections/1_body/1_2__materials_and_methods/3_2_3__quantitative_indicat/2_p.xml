 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], and is optimal for temperate areas where malaria transmission is possible for only one or a few months per year. At the same time, this method is of little use for other areas such as tropical climates, where ADTs always or almost always permit the development of sporozoites, and where the dynamics of malaria are often defined by rainfall. It calls for other methods of forecasting, such as for example, the Gradient Model Risk Index, which is based on a detailed analysis of the environmental conditions for the vector (the dynamics of vector populations, vectorâ€™s ability to transmit the infection), and, occasionally, taking into account human cases [
