<p class="p">As mentioned above, the spread of malaria in temperate areas is limited by the temperature requirements of 
 <italic class="italic">Plasmodia</italic> at the extrinsic part of their life cycle. For the development of the sporozoites of 
 <italic class="italic">P. vivax</italic> to occur, the ADT should be no lower than +16 °C. If this condition is met, the ADTs excesses over the threshold of 14.5 °C are summed up, and when the sum reaches 105 °C, this indicates that the sporogony is over [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-00694" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. If ADTs fall below 16 °C, this particular day is excluded. In this case, sporogony is interrupted, but it can resume if the break is shorter than a week. It is important to note that when the ADT is close to the lower threshold, the maturation of sporozoites goes so slowly that the time required surpasses the life span of mosquitoes, and the possibility of transmission becomes negligible. At higher ADTs, the development of sporozoites continue to accelerate up to about 30 °C. Temperatures above 30 °C are deleterious for both parasites and mosquitoes.
