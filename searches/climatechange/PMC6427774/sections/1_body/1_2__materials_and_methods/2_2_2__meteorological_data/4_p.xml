<p class="p">Average daily temperatures (ADT) were calculated based on observations on three-hourly intervals. The missing data ratio did not exceed 5% for all the weather stations considered, and we applied a gap-filling algorithm to restore missing ADT values. This algorithm is based on the method of [

Missing values for a given station were filled using the multiple linear regressions between existing ADT values for this station and a number of the nearest stations. Such an approach allows restoring missing values while taking into account the typical local climate features.
