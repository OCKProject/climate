<p class="p">In this research, we have demonstrated the patterns of spatial variability and long-term dynamics of the climatic favorability to malaria in Moscow megacity and its surroundings. Due to the climate warming, the climate of the region has become significantly more conducive to a new resurgence of malaria. This mandates the continuation of antimalaria preventive activities, despite the interruption of malaria transmission that had been achieved. The most favorable climatic conditions were found within Moscow megacity, especially in the city center, which is warmer than the rural surroundings due to the urban heat island effect. In the central part of the city, the season of effective infectiveness is longer by 25 days, and the integral index of climate favorability is higher by 85% in comparison to mean values over the rural surroundings. Moreover, the observed intensification of the urban heat island additionally amplifies the rates of summer climate warming and the growth of favorability for malaria transmission. Such favorable conditions seem to be mostly counterbalanced by the hostility of the highly urbanized environment toward the anopheline vector. The presented results show the importance of taking the local climatic features of urban environment into consideration in malaria studies, as well as monitoring antimalaria preventive activities.</p>
