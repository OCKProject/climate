<p class="p">As a proxy for species’ direct exposure to climate change we used projections of mean annual temperature and mean annual moisture index under the IPCC A1F1 scenario, in which the world remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels [

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] for an Australian context, we categorised projected change in annual mean temperature and change in mean annual moisture index according to the categories in 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>. A change of 0–1°C was scored as category 1, whereas a change greater than 2.25°C was scored as category 5. We then calculated the proportion of each species’ current distribution that would be affected by the different magnitudes of climate change.
