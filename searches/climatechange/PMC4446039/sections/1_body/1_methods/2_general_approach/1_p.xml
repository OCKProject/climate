<p class="p">To estimate each species’ vulnerability to climate change we used the NatureServe climate change vulnerability index [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. This index was developed according to the framework produced by Williams et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], and integrates information on exposure (six factors: two direct and four indirect,

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>) and intrinsic sensitivity to climate change (sixteen factors; 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Based on analysis of relevant literature, we scored each factor according to its contribution to each species’ vulnerability: ‘decrease vulnerability’ (DV), ‘somewhat decrease vulnerability’ (SDV), neutral (N), ‘somewhat increase vulnerability’ (SIV), ‘increase vulnerability’ (IV), ‘greatly increase vulnerability’ (GIV; 
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Dataset</xref>). Where there was uncertainty about a classification, we assigned a species to multiple categories as advised by Young et al. [
