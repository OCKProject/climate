<p class="p">Once the drivers of climate change vulnerability are known for species, management actions can be derived (
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). Actions associated with reducing vulnerability for small bodied species such as amphibians include the installation of microhabitat refuges and restoration and manipulation of moisture levels at breeding sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Artificially changing the habitat and local microclimate to be more suitable for amphibians may give them the best chance of surviving climate change. Often dispersal limited, some species may be best assisted by translocation and, in the case of plants, by replanting of seedlings at new climatically suitable sites [

 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. In some cases, it may be most cost effective to establish captive populations, as has recently been attempted for orange-bellied parrots [
 <xref rid="pone.0124766.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. It is also important to consider whether these actions will take place in protected areas, where because of shelter from other threats, there is a stronger chance of success [
