<p id="Par18" class="p">This study has identified a number of species that face increased threats by virtue of the islands they inhabit and the impact of climate change on these islands. Of particular concern is the large number of endemic species that inhabit one island only. A total of 150 terrestrial vertebrate species classed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN inhabit 674 of the 1779 islands in the Pacific. Critically endangered species number 38, and of these 19 are endemic to the Pacific; of these 18 occur on one island only. Projected mean significant wave height data shows that many of the islands that host these species will face substantially increased threats from climate change related events in the future.</p>
