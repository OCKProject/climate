<p id="Par19" class="p">This is the first known work that relates species threat levels, as reported by the IUCN, with island susceptibility under future climate. The methodology applied here can be used for prioritization of resources and species for protection. It highlights the fact that not only the species and their threat levels are important, but also the islands or surroundings where they live. This is especially true for species found on small islands, where the opportunity to translocate is minimal, and so the state or vulnerability of the island takes added importance.</p>
