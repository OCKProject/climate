<p id="Par17" class="p">The islands in the Pacific are predominantly small in size, limestone or reefal in origin, and with low elevations. In fact the median area of the 1779 islands in our database was 1.34 sq km and 36% of the islands were reef islands, which had a maximum elevation of 3â€‰m. The combination of low elevations, small land area, unconsolidated sediments as lithologic origins, and exposure to open oceans makes many of these islands quite vulnerable. Projected increases in sea level rise and associated mean significant wave heights, together with more intense tropical cyclones, are likely to exacerbate these vulnerabilities and result in significant habitat destruction. This will be a major threat to species inhabiting these islands, especially since habitat loss on these islands cannot be countered by dispersal

 </sup>. The impacts will be variable for different species, depending on which type of island they inhabit, the distribution of these species, and the projected impacts of climate change. Each of the islands has unique physical and geographical attributes, and is subject to meteorologic and oceanographic conditions peculiar to its tectonic setting, hence sea level rise and projected wave height impacts will be different for different regions (countries)

 </sup>. Species found on one or only a few islands only will generally be more vulnerable, species found on higher susceptible islands will be more vulnerable, and species found in regions with higher projected sea level rise and mean significant wave heights will be more vulnerable. For species on small islands, migration to other islands in search of suitable habitat is not an option. Extinction of endemic species found on these islands, especially if they occur on only one or a few islands, is a real possibility and could accelerate under climate change forecast by the latest IPCC report
