<p id="Par3" class="p">The aim of this study was to undertake a broad-scale understanding of the distribution of vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered terrestrial vertebrate species in the Pacific and the assessment of impacts of climate change and sea level rise. Species vulnerability classes were combined with an island susceptibility categorization (very low, low, medium, high and very high) that was derived from a combination of island lithology, area, shape (roundness) and elevation. A total of 150 terrestrial vertebrate species that were ranked as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered by the IUCN

 </sup> were overlaid on an island database with 1779 islands and matched with island susceptibilities (to climate change). The information generated was then overlain on regional scale sea level rise and wave height projections to identify those species that occurred on the fewest islands, on islands with the highest susceptibility categorization, and that fell in the most vulnerable zones as identified by high projected sea level rise and highest wave heights. We have used two approaches for assessing the potential impact of climate change on the vertebrates. Firstly we used island geometry and lithology to develop and index of susceptibility of islands. This does not consider climate impacts. Vertebrates found on more susceptible islands are generally more vulnerable. Secondly we used projected sea level rise and mean significant wave heights to look at the impact of climate change on the islands and identify those islands with high and very susceptible rankings that fell in regions of high projected sea level rise and high mean significant wave heights. Species on these islands are more vulnerable than those on similar islands but falling in lower projected sea level rise regions. The information generated here identifies the most vulnerable terrestrial vertebrate species in the Pacific that need prioritization in terms of conservation efforts.
