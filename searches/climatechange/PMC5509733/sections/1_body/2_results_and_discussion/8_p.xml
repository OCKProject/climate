<p id="Par14" class="p">Species that are found on one island only are generally at a higher risk of extinction than those that are found on multiple islands, however the island size and resources available are important criteria and the above statement will only be true for similar islands. For instance, 
 <italic class="italic">Perochirus Ateles (Micronesia Saw-tailed Gecko)</italic> was found on 169 islands, therefore is under a much lower risk of extinction than many other species that are found on one or only a few islands. Of the 38 critically endangered species in this study, 30 were found on one island only, while of the 61 endangered species 31 were on one island only. Fortunately, none of these islands were in the high or very high susceptible ranking, with only one island in the moderate ranking category. The list of these species and island susceptibility rankings are provided in Supplementary TableÂ
