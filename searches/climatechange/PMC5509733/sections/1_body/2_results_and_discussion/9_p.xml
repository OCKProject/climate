<p id="Par15" class="p">Of the 150 vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered species, 84 are endemic to this region (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). These species are only found in this region of the world, and so deserve extra attention since a loss of any of these species will mean global extinction. 54 of the 84 endemic species are found on one island only, 11 are found on two islands, while the remaining 19 are found on three or more islands. Some of these species are very widespread, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Emoia boettgeri (Micronesia Forest Skink)</italic> which is found on 125 islands, 
 <italic class="italic">Emoia tuitarere (type of lizard)</italic> found on 127 islands and 
 <italic class="italic">Loveridgelaps elapoides (Solomons Black-banded krait)</italic> found on 81 islands. Of the 54 endemic species found on one island only, 18 are critically endangered (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). 16 of these are only found on La Grande Terre island in New Caledonia (area 1628 sq km), one on New Guinea in PNG (area 786000 sq km), and one on Goodenough Island in PNG (area 687 sq km). 
 <italic class="italic">Aproteles bulmerae</italic> (Bulmer’s Fruit Bat) is found on New Guinea island in PNG, and while the island is very large in size, the species has a very restricted range, with the area of occupancy being less than 10 square kilometres.
