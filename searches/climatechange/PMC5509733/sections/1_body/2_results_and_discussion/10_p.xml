<p id="Par16" class="p">Finally, spatial data layers of critically endangered, endangered and vulnerable species were overlain on regional scale sea level rise projected mean significant wave height information. Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> represent RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 projections with species data respectively. As can be seen from both figures, some of the Islands that host critically endangered species are located in areas with high projected wave heights, making them even more vulnerable to extinction. For analysis, the projected wave heights were divided into four categories; Low: 0.0–0.1 m, Moderate: 0.1–0.2 m, High: 0.2–0.3 m, and Very High: 0.3–0.4 m (see Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Hs values ranged from 0.0 to 0.3 m for RCP 4.5 projections and 0.0–0.4 m for RCP 8.5 projections. Under RCP 4.5 projections, most of the islands that host a critically endangered, endangered or vulnerable species are in the 0.1–0.2 m category (478/674); however under RCP 8.5 there are more islands in the higher 0.2–0.3 m category (293/674). Under RCP 4.5 only one island that is host to one of these species falls in the 0.2–0.3 m category, with no islands in the highest 0.3–0.4 m category; however under RCP 8.5 there are 293 islands in the 0.2–0.3 m category and 24 islands in the highest 0.3–0.4 m category. 23 islands with endangered species and one island with critically endangered species falls in this critical bracket (see Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Of concern is the observation that large numbers of islands hosting critically endangered species fall in the higher projected Hs categories, and more so under RCP 8.5 projections. The Northern Mariana Islands, islands in Fiji, Tonga and New Caledonia host most of the critically endangered species, and Fiji, Tonga and the Northern Mariana Islands all fall in the high and very high categories under RCP 8.5 projections. Comparing the projected Hs values with the island susceptibility rankings, we see that most of the islands in the Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Tonga and Tokelau have the highest susceptibility rankings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), are host to many endangered species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and fall in the moderate to high projected Hs values (Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), hence the species on these islands are perhaps most at risk and many of these species may need to be moved from the endangered to the critically endangered threat level.
