 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> illustrates the spatial distribution of the species (from all three categories of mammals, reptiles and amphibians) in the islands without considering their vulnerability condition. Dark green dots represent the islands which host one species only, and dark red dots show the islands with more than five types of species. As can be seen, some islands are host to only one type of species while many islands hosted more than one species. Species found on one or only a few islands are generally more vulnerable to extinction while species found on multiple islands generally have a higher chance of survival. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> summarizes this information. The 59 very high susceptible islands host a total of 12 unique species (those species found on one susceptibility class islands only); 3 of them from the vulnerable class, 8 from endangered class and 1 from the critically endangered class. The 178 islands with high susceptibility ranking that host at least one species are home to 26 unique species, 8 vulnerable, 12 endangered and 6 critically endangered. Critically endangered species that are found on very high or high susceptible islands are 
 <italic class="italic">Pteropus insularis (Chuuk flying fox), Brachylophus vitiensis (Fiji crested iguana), Emoia slevini (Mariana Skink), Pteralopex flanneryi (Greater Monkey-faced Bat), Solomys ponceleti (Poncelet’s Giant Rat)</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Spilocuscus rufoniger (Black-spotted Cuscus)</italic>; while endangered species that are found on very high susceptible islands are 
 <italic class="italic">Brachylophus fasciatus (Fiji banded iguana), Emballonura semicaudata (Pacific Sheath-tailed Bat), Emoia adspersa (Micronesian Skink), Emoia boettgeri (Micronesia Forest Skink), Emoia lawesi (Olive Small-scaled Skink), Emoia trossula (Viti Barred Treeskink), Perochirus ateles (Micronesia Saw-tailed Gecko)</italic> and
