<p id="Par10" class="p">Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the islands that hosted at least one species and islands with no species. Islands that do not host any of the recorded species are presented by empty circles. Moreover, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> gives information regarding the islands’ susceptibility ranking. As can be seen, most of the high and very high susceptible islands that host at least one of the species are grouped around each other and placed in the south-southwest, southwest and northwest regions of the Pacific. One of the reasons for this is that this is where we have the larger islands of the Pacific, such as Viti Levu and Vanua Levu of the Fiji group, Espiritu Santo and Malekula of Vanuatu, and La Grande Terre of New Caledonia. Most of these are volcanic or high limestone islands, with relatively large areas. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands are an exception to this.
