Of the 674 islands that hosted at least one species, 15 islands hosted 6 or more species (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), 3 islands hosted 5 species, 34 islands hosted 4 species, 143 islands hosted 3 species, 207 islands hosted 2 species and 272 islands hosted 1 species only.
