<p id="Par13" class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the number of unique species found on one island susceptibility class only and the number of islands in that susceptibility class hosting the species. The breakdown shows that islands with very high and high susceptibility ranking do not host any species that are unique to these islands only. Of course these islands are home to many species (38; see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), but all these species are also found on other islands with lower susceptibility rankings. The low and very low susceptible islands host many more unique species; for example islands with very low susceptibility ranking host 14 critically endangered species that are found on these islands only and there are 16 islands across which these 14 species are distributed.
