 </sup>. This database has species names, their vulnerability rankings and distribution detail. All threatened species (vulnerable, endangered and critically endangered) found in the study region and belonging to the taxonomic groups of amphibians, mammals and reptiles (terrestrial vertebrates) were downloaded and marine species excluded. Distribution data was downloaded in the form of polygon vector files. All data was re-projected to the same projection as the island database so that they could be overlain together and relevant information extracted for analysis.
