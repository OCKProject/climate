<p id="Par6" class="p">Finally, the extracted islands on which the species occurred, together with their indicative susceptibility values, was overlain on regional scale sea level rise and projected mean significant wave height (Hs) information. This analysis was undertaken to identify those species that occurred on only a few islands with a high susceptibility category, were endemic to the Pacific and would be impacted by relatively higher sea level rise and mean significant wave height. What we are saying here is that, given two islands with exactly the same physical characteristics (same area, maximum elevation, shape and lithology), species on the one impacted by a higher sea level rise and mean significant wave height would be more vulnerable as that island becomes more susceptible under such conditions. For example, if both islands were small, low, narrow and sandy, the one in the projected higher sea level rise region would be more susceptible to change and thus species on that island would generally be more vulnerable. Mean Significant Wave Height (Hs) data was obtained from the South Pacific Applied Geoscience Commission (SOPAC). Two concentration pathways, RCP 4.5 (a medium low emission scenario) and RCP 8.5 (a high emission scenario) were used under the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5) model. The climate models used were CNRM-CM5, HadGEM2-ES, INMCM4 and ACCESS1.0. An ensemble average was obtained for 2081–2100 and the difference between the projected and the historical scenario (1986–2005) was calculated in order to obtain the projected changes in Hs. This projection was on a monthly basis. The data was then imported into ARCGIS and a single layer was created that showed the maximum Hs expected at each pixel during the whole year.</p>
