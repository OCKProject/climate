 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), so essentially the whole of the Pacific region extending from Palau in the west to the Pitcairn Islands in the east, near the American west coast, excluding Australia, New Zealand, East Timor and the Indonesian Islands. The area of the region is close to 85 million sq km and has over 2000 islands. Nunn,

 </sup> created a database of 1532 islands in this region and categorized each of the islands based on susceptibility to climate change. This database was extended to include another 247 islands, making a total of 1779 islands. The extra islands were added to include countries not covered by the Nunn,

 </sup> report. Island indicative susceptibility index was developed using four island characteristics: lithology, area, maximum elevation and shape (circularity). Lithology, referring to the relative hardness or softness of the dominant rock type and a measure of erodibility, had eight categories: continental, volcanic high, volcanic low, composite high, composite low, limestone high, limestone low and reef islands. Lithology is an important characteristic as it determines the stability or erodibility of an island. A small volcanic island is a lot less likely to be easily eroded by waves compared to a small sandy island, with loose sediments being easily moved around by waves, wind and rain. Species on such islands are naturally more vulnerable. Area, shape (circularity) and maximum elevation provide a three dimensional geometric description of the island. The smaller the island the more susceptible, the higher the island the less susceptible and the less circular the island the more susceptible. The island susceptibility index was developed using readily available or calculable variables, noting that more detailed data for many of the islands is not available. For example, we used maximum elevation as one of the variables as this can be easily obtained from Google Earth for each of the islands. The median elevation may have been a better variable, however fine resolution digital elevation data are not available for most of the islands and hence the mean or median elevations of each of the islands cannot be derived. Details of cutoff values and ranking criteria are given in Nunn,

 </sup>. A similar method was applied to the remaining 247 islands that were added to the database. Islands were ranked in susceptibility from very low to very high (very low, low, medium, high, very high), indicating long-term susceptibility of each island to physical change due to climatic and oceanic processes. It should be mentioned here that this is a generalist approach and does not look at the explicit habitats of each of the species. We are saying that, generally, species on a small, low, narrow sandy island are more vulnerable than those on a large, high, round volcanic island; however this will not always be true. Species in coastal areas will be more vulnerable than those inland, however this is a whole-island index and appropriate for a regional scale analysis.
