<p class="p">Multi-decadal satellite observations provide continuous spatiotemporal measurements of sea surface temperature (SST) and sea ice concentration (SIC) in the Southern Ocean, which are essential for a continental-scale view of Adélie penguin chick-rearing habitats
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. The high covariance between atmospheric (e.g., air temperature, wind, sea level pressure) and oceanic conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> suggest that SST and SIC may be good proxies for the quality of penguins’ terrestrial nesting habitats that can be impacted by weather, and/or indicators of food resources. Here, we develop austral-summer chick-rearing habitat suitability (CRHS) models that simulate the quality of coastal habitats using true presence-absence Adélie penguin colony locations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) and satellite-derived information on SIC, SST, and bare-rock locations. We used this model to project the quality of penguin habitats in the future using global climate models assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and a prototype, high-resolution global climate model developed by the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL). To understand the sensitivity of our results, we compared two species distribution models (MaxEnt and Generalized Additive Models [GAMs]) and used presence and absence data from different portions of the Adélie penguin’s range.
