<p class="p">Climate has influenced the distribution patterns of penguins for millions of years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The Adélie penguin has intermittently occupied the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) for ~6,000 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>, East Antarctica for at least 14,000 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>, and the Ross Sea for ~45,000 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. The paleoclimate record suggests that periodic colony abandonment corresponds to glacial expansion or extensive permanent sea ice while reoccupation corresponds to warming periods marked by deglaciation or sea ice declines that allow access to rocky nesting habitats
