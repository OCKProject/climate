<p class="p">Satellite-derived and climate model projections of SST and SIC are available on different spatial scales and were interpolated to a 25 × 25 km polar stereographic grid surrounding Antarctica
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. Yearly climatologies were created for each parameter for the austral summer chick-rearing period from December to February (DJF). To understand, compare and account for climate model biases, we computed differences in the mean and standard deviation between DJF satellite observations (1978–2004) and climate model historical runs, using the historical runs from the CMIP5 models (1978–2004) and from the GFDL 1990 control simulations (years 101–140, global atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was fixed at year 1990 concentration; CM2.1, CM2.6). We created climate model deltas by subtracting the mean of historical runs from the CMIP5 models (1978–2004) and the control simulation for GFDL models from their respective climate model projection for each year. The projections from GFDL models CM2.1 and CM2.6 were a transient climate response experiment such that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the atmosphere increased by 1% per year until it doubled by year 70. Further details on these models and experiments can be found in
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. Using the delta approach to bias correct the mean, we added climate model SST and SIC deltas to the satellite climatologies to create annual climatologies of climate model conditions. Due to poor coastal resolution, we interpolated climate model projections to land (except for GFDL-CM2.6 which has high coastal resolution) and evaluated model biases based on the 200-km surrounding Antarctica and sub-Antarctic islands. From SST and SIC mean biases (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 23</xref>), we considered the best models to have average projections within ±1 °C and ±20% SIC. All models had a relatively low bias in SIC and SST variability (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 24</xref>). This resulted in seven global climate models and we also used GFDL-CM2.6 because it is a high-resolution model, which may more accurately represent dynamics in the coastal ocean. Climate model projections had a similar overall range and mean rate of change in SST and SIC (
