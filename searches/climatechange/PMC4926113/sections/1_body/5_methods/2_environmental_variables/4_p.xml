<p class="p">Our study focused on the coastline around sub-Antarctic islands and Antarctica. Each coastline pixel was classified as having bare-rock present or absent. For the satellite record and climate projections, we spatially averaged SIC and SST within 75â€‰km of each coastline pixel for each year to incorporate the ocean environment within the penguins foraging range.</p>
