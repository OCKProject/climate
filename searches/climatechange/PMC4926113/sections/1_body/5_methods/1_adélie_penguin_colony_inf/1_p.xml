 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. These datasets provided true presence and true absence locations throughout the entire Adélie penguin breeding range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). We considered present locations to be all colonies present in the late 70s/early 80s that had a colony status of present or presumed present. All colonies we considered to be present were mapped in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> with the associated population status. Obtaining direct population counts for all known Adélie populations across decades has generally been constrained by logistics and the remoteness of some colonies. Lynch and LaRue (2014) reported a crude qualitative categorization of trends but more sophisticated models to estimate population trends are currently being developed as part of the Mapping Application for Penguin Populations and Projected Dynamics (MAPPPD; penguinmap.org). However, the agreement between population trends on a regional scale provides confidence in individual colony trends
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Penguin population trends are independent of model development (see below) and were only used to evaluate model predictions. All analyses and statistics were carried out in R (
