 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 25</xref>). We separated WAP and continental locations based on opposite climate trends in the two regions (as done by
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>). We also projected the model onto future climate scenarios from our eight best performing models using GAMs and all presence-absence locations. We created CRHS maps for each year and used linear regression across time to identify locations of significant change in CRHS. We also identified areas with novel climate using multivariate environmental similarity surfaces in MaxEnt, which measures the similarity between the environment in the model training dataset and the new environment in the projection years.
