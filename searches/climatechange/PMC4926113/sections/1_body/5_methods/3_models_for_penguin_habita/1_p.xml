<p class="p">We modeled the suitability of Adélie penguin chick-rearing habitats using two species distribution models, a maximum entropy approach (MaxEnt) and generalized additive models (GAMs, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Methods</xref>). Both approaches estimate the habitat suitability, ranging from 0 (least suitable) to 1 (most suitable). The CRHS models were trained with bare rock locations, and average SST and SIC climatologies from 1978–1984
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. This multiyear average smoothed the high interannual variability characteristic of Antarctic marine environments and includes data prior to the regime shift occurring in the mid to late 1980s
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. The model trained on 1978–1984 was then projected onto annual climatologies for SIC, SST, and bare-rock locations from 1981 to 2010. Bare rock locations were static for all years. Our approach does not account for possible changes in bare-rock locations due to sea level rise, or coastal glacial collapse exposing new nest sites. Global projections suggest the sea level could rise by 0.57–1.31 m by 2100
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref> while a higher resolution model suggests Antarctica has the potential to contribute more than a meter of sea level rise by 2100
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Uncertainties in annual sea level rise and glacial collapse projections inhibit us from including this into our habitat suitability model. However, while bare rock is necessary for Adélie penguin nest sites, it does not appear to be a limiting factor, as there is currently ample uncolonized bare rock in all regions of Antarctica. Our suitability projections could be overly optimistic if sea level rise inundates nesting habitat more quickly than new nesting sites are exposed due to glacial retreat, or our projections could be overly pessimistic if new nest sites are exposed by glacial retreat at a faster rate than sea level rise.
