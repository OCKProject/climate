 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) cannot be assessed in the geologic record because of its coarse temporal frequency. Our study suggests that in many regions of Antarctica climate warming has tipped past peak suitability so that further warming is no longer beneficial to Adélie penguins. Warm SSTs may drive a substantial decline in the suitability of chick-rearing habitats at northerly latitudes but several refugia, particularly in the more stable Ross and Amundsen Seas, may buffer species-wide declines under climate change projections. In the northern Ross Sea, the Cape Adare region is thought to have been a glacial refuge in the past

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> and is projected to provide refuge in the future even as conditions warm. Most of the Cape Adare colony breeds on a large beach that is just above sea level while fewer penguins breed on the escarpment and upper terrace. Therefore, this location will only be a refuge for a large population in glacial conditions when sea level is lower. Interestingly, the northern South Sandwich and Orkney Islands appear to be more favorable chick-rearing habitats, with fewer years of novel climate, than southern islands and the WAP. WAP Adélie penguin populations may have undergone similar population boom and busts in the geologic past because the current rate of warming, while highly unusual, is not unprecedented
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Over the past two millennia, the WAP had high climate variability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> that could makes it an unstable chick-rearing site for Adélie penguins with more sporadic occupancy than seen elsewhere. The WAP appears disproportionately vulnerable to projected climate change compared to other regions. Contemporary warming on the WAP is related to both atmospheric changes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> and the delivery of warmer upper circumpolar deep water onto the continental shelf 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The direct or indirect effects of this warming are detrimental to Adélie penguin populations and could lead to population declines at ~30% of colonies by 2060 and ~60% of colonies by 2099 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). With continued warming, new bare rock nesting habitats may become available as glaciers disintegrate but colonization will likely be limited to southern localities
