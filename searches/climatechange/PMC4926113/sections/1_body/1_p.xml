<p class="p">Climate change can have profound effects on penguins’ terrestrial nesting sites and marine food resources. Adélie penguins construct nests on ice- and snow-free terrain with pebbles to keep eggs and chicks dry and out of any water. Precipitation and snowmelt can cause nest site flooding that drowns eggs and small chicks

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, and has been linked to population declines
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Tight coupling in the Antarctic food web, where sea ice, wind, and water column stability impact phytoplankton and Antarctic krill (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, has lead to concerns that climate change will cause a decrease in krill abundance, a major food source for Adélie penguins. However, recent studies show no long-term (1993–2013) change in WAP krill biomass
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> and current krill biomass should support Adélie penguin breeding colonies
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Although changes in, or competition for, krill may not be the main driver of WAP population declines
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, we cannot discount the negative effects of warm waters on krill quality
