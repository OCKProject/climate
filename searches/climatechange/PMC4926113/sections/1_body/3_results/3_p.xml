In addition, our parsimonious model could be missing an important component of habitat suitability or there could be errors in the population trends. Because individual colonies may be impacted by idiosyncratic factors operating on fine-scales, independent of large-scale climatic influences, patterns of occupancy and trend at regional and continental-scales are required to understand the role of changing climate on habitat suitability. Therefore, additional factors, either at finer scales than captured by our datasets, or factors not included in our analysis, likely contribute to population declines. Other factors that influence population trends that we could not account for include predation
