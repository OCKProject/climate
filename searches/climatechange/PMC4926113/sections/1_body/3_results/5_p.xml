<p class="p">We determined the rate that novel climate will occur at Adélie penguin colonies using satellite observations (1981–2010) and the global climate model ensemble (2011–2099) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). During 1981 to 2010, decreasing populations had a minimum of one, an average of four, and a maximum of seven years of novel climate over 30 years of observation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) illustrating differential sensitivity of colonies to novel climate. This corresponds to a rate of 3.3% to 23.3% (mean 13.3%) of novel climate per annum associated with colony decline. By 2060, our projections suggest 58% to 25% (mean 36%) of colonies could experience population declines due to novel climate alone, containing 43% to 9% (mean 21%) of the currently known Adélie penguin abundance, respectively. Similarly, by 2099, our projections suggest 78% to 51% (mean 58%) of colonies could experience declines, containing 64% to 39% (mean 46%) of the current abundance.
