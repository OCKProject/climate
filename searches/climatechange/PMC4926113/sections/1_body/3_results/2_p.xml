<p class="p">We determined whether each penguin colony experienced novel climate from 1981 to 2010, and tested for significant differences between the number of years with novel climate at decreasing, increasing and stable populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Over 50% of decreasing penguin colonies experienced novel climate as a result of warm SST, however, no declining continental colonies experienced this novel warm SST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). Only ~15% of increasing and stable populations had novel climate related to warm SST (stable n = 1, increasing n = 3), cool SST (stable n = 3, increasing n = 2), or high SIC (stable n = 4, increasing n = 1). Almost 25% of populations with an unknown trend had novel climate due to warm SST and are located along the WAP or northerly islands, suggesting these population may be in decline (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>). Colonies with decreasing populations experienced significantly more years with novel climate than populations that were increasing in abundance (nonparametric Krustal-Wallis test and multiple comparisons test after Krustal-Wallis, p &lt; 0.05;
