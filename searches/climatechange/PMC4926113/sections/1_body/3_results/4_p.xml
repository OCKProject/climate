<p class="p">Climate projections from global models assessed by the IPCC and from GFDL’s high-resolution CM2.6 reveal similar trends in the cumulative number of years with novel climate in various Antarctic sectors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The southern WAP, islands, and northern WAP regions, which are already experiencing population declines, are projected to experience the greatest frequency of novel climate in this century due to warm SST (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Figs 13–20</xref> for colony projections from each climate model). Adélie penguin colonies in East Antarctica and Enderby Land are projected to experience &lt;10 years of novel climate by 2099 while colonies in the Ross and Amundsen Seas are projected to experience &lt;5 years of novel climate. Model projections show the majority of future novel climate will be related to warm SST (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Figs 13–20</xref>). However, ACCESS1-0, CESM1-BGC, CMCC-CC and GFDL-CM2.6 projected a few locations in the Amundsen Sea and continental Antarctica will experience novel climate due to cool SST or high sea ice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Figs 13,15,17,20</xref>). The magnitude of novel SST is projected to increase over time with different sectors around Antarctica changing at various rates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 21</xref>). While novel SST was generally within ~0.5 °C above or below novel SST during the satellite record (1981–2010), SST may warm to more than 5 °C (i.e. &gt;3 °C warmer than the contemporary period) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 22</xref>). These large changes are projected at northern latitudes, especially the southern WAP but also in the northern WAP and islands (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 21</xref>). In the Amundsen Sea, Ross Sea, East Antarctica and Enderby Land, climate model projections suggest the distribution of SST will shift towards warmer conditions but SST will generally remain within non-novel conditions, which resulted in fewer cumulative degrees of novel climate compared to more northerly sectors (
