<p class="p">Adélie penguin CRHS models show the spatial distribution of novel climate and changes in CRHS compared to historic observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). All CRHS models performed well (area under the curve (AUC) &gt; 0.85) and confirmed the importance of SST, SIC and bare rock to penguin chick-rearing habitats (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Results</xref>). In this study, novel climate is SST or SIC outside the range of average SST and SIC observations from 1978–1984 (−2.42 &gt; SST &gt; 1.55 °C, SIC &gt; 95.41%), which corresponds to CRHS model training data (see methods). Interestingly, ~1.5 °C was roughly the warmest SST that increasing Adélie penguin populations experienced throughout the entire satellite record while many decreasing populations experienced SST warmer than this threshold (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 1</xref>). The WAP experienced the greatest number of novel climate years, with up to seven years of novel climate from 1981–2010 and over 40 years of novel climate using an ensemble of global climate model projections from 2011–2099 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Figs 2–9</xref> for individual climate model output and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 10</xref> for variability). Marguerite Bay appears to be on a slower warming trajectory compared to the WAP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>), which is also evident in the high-resolution GFDL-CM2.6 projections (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 9</xref>). While both the WAP and Ross Sea regions have been characterized by high CRHS in the recent past (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>), our model projects a substantial decrease in CRHS along the WAP and an increase in CRHS in the Ross Sea over the next century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). The Cape Adare region, home to the earliest known occupation and the largest Adélie colony
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, had no novel climate and high CRHS in the past and future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). CRHS in the Cape Adare region is also projected to increase in the future (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 11</xref>). At Cape Adare, SST is projected to increase from about −1 °C to 0 °C and SIC is projected to decrease from ~20% to ~10% by 2100 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 11</xref>), with these changes in SST and SIC shifting towards peak suitability (see response curves, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplemental Fig. 12</xref>). The northeastern Antarctic Peninsula appears to be a more favorable environment than the southwestern Antarctic Peninsula (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,b</xref>). From 1981–2010, the South Shetland Islands and the WAP had a similar number of novel climate years and mean CRHS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a,b</xref>) but CRHS improved in the South Shetland Islands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). During this time, the more northerly South Sandwich and South Orkney Islands experienced no years with novel climate, higher mean CRHS and improved CRHS compared to southerly islands and the WAP. Comparing two species distribution modeling approaches and two spatial subsets of the presence-absence data, we found the modeling methods (MaxEnt vs. GAMs) produced similar results but varied more when presence or absence data was incomplete. Model output was most sensitive to incomplete absence data, especially when true presence data was included, perhaps because absence data was missing within a specific environmental niche and Adélie penguins do not occupy all available habitats (
