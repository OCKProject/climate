  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The proportion of colonies for each population status that have no novel climate (none) or the leading cause of novel climate is due to warm sea surface temperature (SST), cool SST or high sea ice concentration. Colony locations were defined as WAP and Islands or Continental to understand the spatial distribution of novel climate as it relates to population trends. (
   <bold class="bold">b)</bold> Probability density of the number of years with novel climate at colonies that experienced at least one year of novel climate for populations that are decreasing, increasing, stable and unknown. The thick black box represents the interquartile range, thinner black lines represent upper and lower adjacent values and the white points are the median.
