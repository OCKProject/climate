  <title class="title">The cumulative number of years with novel climate at Adélie penguin colonies in different Antarctic sectors.</title>
  <p class="p">Location map of Adélie penguin colonies and bare rock locations. Each line represents the mean of all colonies in that sector colored by the climate model used for the projection. Satellite observations of novel climate are in red from 1981–2010, IPCC models (RCP 8.5) from 2006–2099 and GFDL-CM2.6 from year 1–79 where atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases by 1% per year and atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> doubles at year 70 in the model simulation. The IPCC ensemble mean shows the average trend for all IPCC models in a sector (not including GFDL-CM2.6). See
