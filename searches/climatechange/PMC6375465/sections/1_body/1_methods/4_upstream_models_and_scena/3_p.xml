<p class="p">Following this, climate was introduced into the model: first, as a counterfactual future without climate change and then as low- and high-impact climate change scenarios. Because the magnitude of climate change in 2030 is only minimally affected by future emissions and climate policies, the difference between the low- and high-impact scenarios is related to the magnitude of expected impacts, rather than emissions. Impacts in a set of sectors were assessed across all the initial climate scenarios. These sectors included: 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) food prices and food production (as impacts of food price on households’ available income, and changes in farmers’ incomes); 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) health and labor productivity (stunting, as lost income over a lifetime; malaria and diarrheal disease, as treatment costs and days of work lost; 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) labor productivity losses, as proportion of labor time lost; and, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>) disasters, as income losses due to exposure to cyclones, storm surge, floods, and drought). The smallest impacts were taken to represent “low climate change” and the highest to represent “high climate change.”
