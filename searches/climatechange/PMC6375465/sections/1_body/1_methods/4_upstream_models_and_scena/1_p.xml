<p class="p">Two streams of modeled scenario-specific projection data were used to drive the stunting model. The first, for incomes, was from a “poverty model” (
 <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017</xref>), which is a microsimulation model based on household surveys from 92 countries, thus representing individual households from across the income spectrum. The second, for food prices, was from the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM) (
 <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Havlík et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Havlík et al. 2015</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Both models were initially driven by standard climate and socioeconomic scenarios. Climate data were from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) under two emissions scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) (
 <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moss et al. 2010</xref>)). RCP 2.6 represents a low emissions future and RCP8.5 represents a high emissions future. Socioeconomic data were from two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) (
 <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Neill et al. 2017</xref>). SSP4 represents a world of rapid population growth, low economic growth, and high inequalities. SSP5 is scenario with low population growth, high economic growth, and large environmental pressures.
