<p class="p">For the poverty model, based on the above scenarios, a set of tailored scenarios were developed to account for both socioeconomic and climate uncertainties in 2030. Firstly, socioeconomic futures were developed. A total of 300 subscenarios for each SSP were generated to capture the various ways that the macrolevel conditions specified in the SSPs may be reached by 2030. This included differences in factors such as: 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) structural change, as share of labor force in each sector (i.e., agriculture, manufacturing, services) by skill level (i.e., low, high) and participation rates; 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) productivity growth of skilled and unskilled labor and in each sector; 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) demographic change, and 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>) policies (e.g., pensions and social transfers). The scenarios based on SSP4 represent “poverty” futures, with a global stability in the fraction of people living in poverty. Those based on SSP5 represent “prosperity” futures, which are broadly consistent with the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (
