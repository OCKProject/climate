 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) the historical data and indicators used when fitting the stunting model, 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) the forms of the equations and the process of fitting the stunting model, and 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) the poverty and food-price models and the scenario-specific projection data used to make the estimates of future stunting. For the latter, a full set of projection data was available only out to 2030, and this limited the temporal horizon of our stunting estimates.
