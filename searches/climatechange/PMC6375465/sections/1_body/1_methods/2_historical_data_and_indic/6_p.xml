Additionally, a lack of data meant we were unable to account for differing expenditure patterns in low-income populations; in effect, it is assumed that expenditure patterns are similar in this population group in the study countries. As the food-price indicator increases, food becomes less affordable (on average) for the poorest part of the population. If data required to derive
