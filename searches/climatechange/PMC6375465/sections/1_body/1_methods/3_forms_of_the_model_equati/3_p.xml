<p class="p">We initially fit “null” growth-curve models that included random effects and year only. The approach provides a formal test of whether a multilevel model gives a better fit than an equivalent single-level model and provides an initial assessment of stunting trajectories in recent decades. Following this we fit “full” models containing the predictor variables for each outcome.</p>
