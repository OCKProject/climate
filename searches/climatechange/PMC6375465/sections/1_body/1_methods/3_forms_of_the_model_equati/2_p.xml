 <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Steele 2014</xref>) to estimate national-level trajectories of moderate stunting and severe stunting, using longitudinal national-level predictors while allowing for autocorrelation, and to assess time-varying and fixed predictors and unexplained differences (
 <xref rid="c38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal 2012</xref>). We used separate binomial logistic regression models (with the number stunted being calculated using prevalence and sample size from the survey data for stunting) to derive estimates for the prevalence of moderate stunting or severe stunting, respectively.
