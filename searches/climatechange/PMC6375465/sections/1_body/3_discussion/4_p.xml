<p class="p">Consistent with previous work (
 <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lloyd et al. 2014</xref>), our projections suggest that climate change will have a relatively small—but not insignificant—impact on stunting in 2030, whereas estimated between-socioeconomic scenario differences are large. Mean estimates of child stunting in the study countries in the poverty and prosperity scenarios are 110 million and 83 million, respectively (

Of note, the wide variation in these estimates across the 300 subscenarios for each SSP (which differed by demographic characteristics, economic policies, the distribution and participation of labor, productivity growth by sector, and labor skill levels), suggests that the particular mechanisms that produce poverty or prosperity futures could have substantial influences on patterns of health.
