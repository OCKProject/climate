<p class="p">Sixth, despite the complexity of the causation of undernutrition, we include explicit predictors related only to incomes and food prices in our model. However, as our aim is to represent the total effects of incomes and food prices on stunting, we follow the general logic outlined by Biggs etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Although other factors, such as education and access to water and sanitation, affect stunting, they are also likely to be strongly influenced by incomes. This influence means that: 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) if such factors were added to a regression model, they would absorb some of the effects of income on stunting; and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) such factors are likely to be highly collinear with income and may cause model fitting problems. Thus, by including just income and price, we attempt to capture their full effects regardless of the specific causal pathway from the predictors to the outcomes.
