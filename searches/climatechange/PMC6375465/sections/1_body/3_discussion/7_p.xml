<p class="p">These patterns suggest that the impact of climate change will be an increase in aggregate country-level stunting for countries in which average incomes of the poorest are low and food is generally less affordable, even though rising food prices may benefit some population subgroups. However, when incomes of the poorest are higher, sustained higher food prices (relative to incomes) tend to lower country-level stunting (although some groups may be harmed). This suggests that it is not continually falling food prices that will eliminate undernutrition (see also: 
 <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hertel 2016</xref>); rather, food prices that provide a decent income to farmers alongside high levels of employment with wages that adequately cover the costs of living is required (among other things) (

 <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weis 2007</xref>). In sum, the reduction and then elimination of poverty and inequality are required. If these conditions were generally met, our estimates suggest that—at least out to the 2030s—the potential harms of climate change on stunting via the pathways considered would be significantly reduced. We stress that this does not suggest that climate change may improve population health if incomes increase. Rather, it suggests that higher incomes combined with “fair” food prices may reduce stunting and vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.
