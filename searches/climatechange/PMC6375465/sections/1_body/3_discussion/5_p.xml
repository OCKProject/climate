<p class="p">Our projections suggest that, in aggregate, stunting will increase as climate change increases, with larger impacts under the poverty scenario: We estimate that

 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Further, our estimates suggests that severe stunting would account for a greater proportion of climate change–attributable stunting under the poverty scenarios than in the prosperity scenarios, and that the potential impact of climate change on stunting would be greater in rural areas in comparison with urban areas under both socioeconomic scenarios (
 <xref rid="t3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Previous analyses have suggested that the impact of rising food prices on poverty is, in general, greater in urban areas than in rural areas (

 <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ivanic and Martin 2008</xref>). These results, however, are not directly comparable to our findings. First, the causal pathways and outcome differ: Our model looks at the combined impacts of changes in food prices and incomes of the poorest populations on child stunting, rather than how food prices may affect the number of people below a fixed poverty line. Second, the poverty model driving the stunting model assesses how climate change may affect incomes via multiple routes rather than through food prices alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Third, our estimates are based on scenario-specific projections of future socioeconomic conditions, whereas Hertel et al. (
 <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) hold future socioeconomic conditions constant at present level and Ivanic and Martin (
 <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) analyze historical data. Although this different approach may explain the differences in the results, below we briefly discuss further differences in the modeling approaches and how the stunting model may be improved by drawing on this food price–poverty literature.
