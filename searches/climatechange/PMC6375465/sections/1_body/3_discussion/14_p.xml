<p class="p">Fifth, our model is driven by income projections that consider shifts between general labor sectors (
 <xref rid="c9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hallegatte and Rozenberg 2017</xref>), represented as agricultural and nonagricultural incomes (taken to represent rural and urban incomes, respectively) in our model. However, previous studies looking at how food prices affect poverty have shown the importance of more detailed patterns of income sources, as well as ratios of net buyers to net consumers of food, in shaping the aggregate impacts of food prices on poverty (

 <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ivanic and Martin 2008</xref>). These impacts of food prices on poverty would be expected to influence patterns of undernutrition. Future undernutrition models could attempt to represent this explicitly, perhaps by closer integration with the poverty model. However, obtaining the required historical and projection data from a large number of countries is likely to be difficult. (For example, Hertel et al. (
 <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) included 15 countries and Ivanic and Martin (
 <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) included 9 countries.)
