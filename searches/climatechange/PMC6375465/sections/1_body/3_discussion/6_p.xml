<p class="p">We developed a typology based on country-level changes in stunting in response to increasing climate change (
 <xref rid="t4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). In type I countries, incomes of the poorest are relatively low and relative prices tend to be high; in this situation, our projections suggest that increasing climate change is likely to increase stunting. In type II countries, incomes are higher and relative prices are lower; there, increasing climate change is likely to decrease stunting. Type III countries have intermediate incomes and relative food prices, and in these cases, increasing climate change might increase or decrease stunting. That is, type III countries appear to be at income levels where they may transition to type I countries if incomes of the poorest fall, or to type II countries if incomes of the poorest rise.
