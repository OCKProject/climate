<p class="p">There are just two type IV countries, so interpretation should be cautious (
 <xref rid="t4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Under low climate change, these countries have the lowest average income (1.5 to 2 times the poverty line) and high relative prices. In the poverty scenario, as climate change increases, both the average decrease in incomes and increase in relative prices are at their highest. Together, these factors increase stunting. In the prosperity scenario, climate change brings typical reductions in incomes and a much lower increase in price; in this case, stunting is reduced.
