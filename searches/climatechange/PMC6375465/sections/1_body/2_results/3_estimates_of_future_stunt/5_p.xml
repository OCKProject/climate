<p class="p">In type III countries under low climate change, incomes (3 times the poverty line) and relative prices are at an intermediate level (
 <xref rid="t4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). High climate change brings typical relative decreases in income in both socioeconomic scenarios. In the poverty scenario, the rise in relative price is relatively high, and—at these intermediate incomes—the combination of income loss and high price increases reduces overall stunting as climate change increases. In the prosperity scenarios, the rise in relative price is relatively small and does not appear to offset the loss of income, resulting in an increase in stunting as climate change increases. Thus, type III countries appear to be at incomes where the overall effects of increases in relative food prices tend to be either harmful or beneficial.
