<p class="p">We began with a dataset for all countries with stunting data from 1990 onwards (
 <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WHO 2017</xref>). We then dropped observations where stunting data were not split into moderate and severe (15 observations) and countries with measurements on less than three occasions (39 countries). We then obtained income and price data to match the stunting data.
