<p class="p">We next fit the within-country models for distributing national-level stunting between rural and urban areas (
 <xref rid="t2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We fit models with the full set of predictors of interest, and then used backwards stepwise regression to remove nonsignificant predictors (i.e., with 95% confidence intervals that included the null). Again, no independent data were available to validate the models, but correlations between observed and predicted stunting were consistently high (between 0.97 and 0.99) (Figure S3). Likelihood ratio tests suggest the multilevel models have a better fit than equivalent single level models. However, model residuals for the random effects for all models (moderate and severe stunting, rural and urban) show that the 95% confidence intervals are wide and frequently include zero. Further, residual plots for predicted stunting show that the pattern of errors differs by level of stunting and tend to be greatest at lower prevalences (Figures S4 and S5). This suggests that national-level stunting projections made using the equations, particularly when prevalence is low, should be interpreted cautiously. We assessed the model for multicollinearity using the same procedure we employed for 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="d5" class="xref">Equation 5</xref> and again found it was not likely to affect model predictions. (We note that standard errors were wide for the inequalities predictor in the rural severe and urban moderate models; however, these were included in the model as the standard errors for their interaction terms were small.) (Table S3).
