<p class="p">This finding raises three related issues. First, given the complexity of the causation of undernutrition, the large influence of socioeconomic conditions is expected. For example, Smith and Haddad (
 <xref rid="c43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that between 1970 and 2012, 67% of the reduction in stunting was due to improvements in women’s education, gender equality, and access to adequate water and sanitation services. Rayner and Lang (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) state that measures of height (including stunting) are “less an indicator of nutritional status and more a comment on the ‘nutrition-environment interaction,’” where “environment” refers to context rather than just the natural environment. That is, at the population level, stunting is about more than food. Second, as well as affecting food production, climate change may affect undernutrition via socioeconomic routes. For instance, recent work shows that climate change may affect the income of the poorest population groups disproportionately (
 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hallegatte et al. 2016</xref>), and this impact may in turn influence undernutrition risk. Third, interactions between routes from climate to undernutrition may mean the combined impacts are not simply additive and are thus not easily predictable. However, to our knowledge, no previous global-level climate–undernutrition models have considered impacts operating through routes other than food production or more than one climate entry point at a time.
