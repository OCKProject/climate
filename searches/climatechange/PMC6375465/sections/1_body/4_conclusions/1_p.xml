<p class="p">Previous global-level models have shown that climate change–attributable changes in food production and distribution may affect undernutrition and have highlighted the importance of socioeconomic conditions. Our model shifts the focus to how climate change may affect two key socioeconomic drivers—incomes of the poorest and food price—and assesses how their interaction may influence stunting in the 2030s. The patterns in our aggregate results suggest that stunting will increase as climate change increases, with a greater proportion of the burden falling on rural areas, and larger increases in severe stunting in comparison with moderate stunting in the poverty scenarios.</p>
