<p class="p">The disaggregated country-level patterns offer a different insight: In situations when incomes of the poorest are relatively high, modest and sustained increases in food prices relative to incomes may reduce overall stunting. This finding suggests, along with ensuring that adequate quantities of food are produced in the future, a key means of reducing the impacts of climate change on stunting may be—rather than seeking ever-lower food prices—to ensure food prices are high enough to sustain farming households and that decent work with adequate incomes is available for all. Views on how this, particularly the former, might be best achieved are contested (e.g.,

 <xref rid="c35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patel 2009</xref>), but the results of our model suggest that agricultural futures that protect health must consider not just availability, accessibility (e.g.,
