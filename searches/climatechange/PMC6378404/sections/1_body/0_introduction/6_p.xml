<p class="p">There is a need to pragmatically estimate and discuss the importance of climate with respect to other critical factors affecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious diseases. In this review, we discuss recent trends and advances in our understanding of the impact of recent and future climate change on VBD dynamics. We mainly focus on VBDs, as they are expected to be the most climate‐sensitive subset of all infectious diseases and have sensitivity to the greatest number of climate drivers.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">31</xref> we highlight recently observed trends in temperate, Arctic, and tropical‐altitude regions which have already experienced significant changes in climate, and for which one would consequently expect some evidence of early climate change impacts on VBD burden. We also discuss progress in state‐of‐the‐art future risk scenarios for VBDs, methodological issues, and the relevance of this research to policy makers and governmental health agencies.
