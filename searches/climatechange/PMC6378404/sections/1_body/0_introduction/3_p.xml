<p class="p">The negative impact of infectious diseases on health and well‐being is intrinsically linked to a combination of multiple stressors or drivers such as poor sanitation, access to clean water and food, the quality of public health services, political instability and conflict, drug resistance, and animal and/or human population movements.

Climate has a direct impact on the dynamics of a subset of infectious diseases, including vector‐borne diseases (VBDs), some water‐borne diseases such as cholera, and other soil‐borne and food‐borne pathogens.
