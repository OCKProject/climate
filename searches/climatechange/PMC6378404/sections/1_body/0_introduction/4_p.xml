<p class="p">Infectious VBDs are mainly transmitted by arthropod vectors, which are particularly sensitive to changes in climate, for a number of reasons. Arthropods are ectothermic, with their internal temperature regulated by external environmental conditions. Their larval development stage generally requires the presence of bodies of water and/or specific humidity conditions. Vector biting rates tend to increase with temperature up to an upper threshold, after which they decrease.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">15</xref> The entomological parameters affected by rainfall and temperature can be summarized using the maximum daily reproductive rate of the disease: the vectorial capacity.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">16</xref> The optimal temperature range for disease transmission varies depending upon the vectorâ€“pathogen combination being studied; however, vectorial capacities of the most harmful tropical VBDs consistently peak at relatively high temperatures.
