<p class="p">Arguably, the most significant challenge in VBD risk modeling is the diverse nature, quality, and accessibility of observational datasets, particularly in the low‐income countries which bear the largest burden of VBDs. This, coupled with the complex, multilayer, multiscale, dynamic nature of the disease system, has resulted in a huge variety of VBD models, ranging from global‐scale statistical models of risk to agent‐based models that simulate VBD infection within human hosts at the individual scale.</p>
