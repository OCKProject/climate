<p class="p">To date, assessments of the impact of climate change on future VBD risk have primarily been carried out at continental to global scales, either using statistical models linking vector or pathogen presence to environmental and socioeconomic factors, or by using a mechanistic approach such as calculating the disease basic reproduction ratio,

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0194" ref-type="ref" class="xref">194</xref> While statistical models are derived directly from observations and may employ statistical fitting methods which inherently estimate their own uncertainty, they generally tend to produce static maps and do not capture the dynamic relationship between climate and VBD risk, which usually follows a seasonal pattern. Furthermore, statistical models cannot extrapolate risk to different scenarios of intervention or climate patterns beyond those within the training data set. Mechanistic models, on the other hand, have the advantage of explicitly modeling the climate–disease risk relationship, but need detailed information about vector and pathogen processes to parameterize the model, and these are often obtained from a collection of small‐scale studies in the laboratory or field. Additionally, some mechanistic model parameters rely on laboratory experiments carried out in the 1950s–1960s, and these must be updated for different vector–pathogen combinations.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0195" ref-type="ref" class="xref">195</xref> On a positive note, this work is in progress. Mechanistic models also require validation of their simulated risk against observational data. Long time series are needed to robustly assess the predictive skill of such models. When verified as being able to reproduce past outbreaks, such models can then be used with seasonal climate forecasts (for a detailed review, see Ref.
