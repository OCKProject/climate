<p class="p">Recently, some researchers have begun to combine mechanistic and statistical modeling approaches to derive improved VBD risk assessments.

High‐resolution risk maps based on statistical models are very useful resources to inform control measures in countries plagued by VBD and estimate spatial patterns of drug and insecticide resistance,

But temporal variability is also important; as Bill Gates recently said, “Malaria isn't just patchy. It's also spiky. We need to know when those spikes happen, so that we can mobilize.” Mechanistic VBD models relying on rainfall and temperature can reproduce spikes of past VBD outbreaks at broad spatial scales (examples include the bluetongue outbreak in Northern Europe in 2006, ZIKV epidemic in South America in 2015, and historical dengue outbreaks in Mexico and Nicaragua). Consequently, these need to be tested operationally in collaboration with governmental agencies, decision makers, and public health services, as is currently happening.
