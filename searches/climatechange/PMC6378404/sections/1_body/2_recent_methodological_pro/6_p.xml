<p class="p">Significant progress has been achieved in terms of future risk assessment of VBDs over the past decade. An increasing number of studies now utilize an ensemble of climate models driven by different greenhouse gas emission scenarios, coupled with different population scenarios to drive future health impact models. This is critical in order to estimate and communicate the related uncertainties, which can be quite large. Climate model outputs have to be calibrated with respect to climate observations, as they still suffer from systematic biases. Stringent disease model validation over the past is a prerequisite for providing future projections. As climate models have benefited from the development of earth observation systems (satellites and weather stations), disease model validations will increasingly benefit from an improvement in disease surveillance systems worldwide (e.g., the gold standard Global Burden of Disease project). Health impact model intercomparison projects should also be encouraged. The climate community has been comparing climate model outputs produced by different climate centers for many years now (for the Coupled Model InterComparison Project). The impact modeling community recently started to do so, for key sectors such as agriculture, water resources, and health.
