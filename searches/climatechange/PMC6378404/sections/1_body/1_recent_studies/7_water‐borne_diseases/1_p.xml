 <italic class="italic">Vibrio cholerae</italic>, the bacteria that causes cholera, is naturally present in the environment, in particular in coastal and estuarine ecosystems. Rita Colwell devoted her life to studying 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> bacteria and their ecosystem. 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholera</italic>, like other species within the genus, attaches to copepods; the survival of these bacteria and their multiplication consequently rely on plankton population density and environmental variables such as sea surface temperatures and the input of fresh water.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0189" ref-type="ref" class="xref">189</xref> An early warning system based on climatic variables was subsequently developed to assess the risk posed by cholera in Chesapeake Bay, United States. Critically, the quality of public health services, access to clean water and sanitation, and political stability are basic factors impacting cholera outbreaks; a prime example is the recent epidemic in Yemen.

For example, a large cryptosporidium outbreak followed floods from the Mississippi in Milwaukee in 1993, and various toxins and norovirus spread in Katrina's wake in Louisiana in 2005.
