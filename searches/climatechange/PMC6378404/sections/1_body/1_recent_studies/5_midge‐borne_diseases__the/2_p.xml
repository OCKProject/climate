<p class="p">Modeling studies have highlighted that climate conditions favored the spread of the Afrotropical midge vector in southern Europe as well as increasing the vectorial capacity of indigenous

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0169" ref-type="ref" class="xref">169</xref> This outbreak coincided with the heatwave that hit Europe during summer 2006 (and caused a large increase in mortality in the elderly human population). Furthermore, the wind dispersal of infected midges and the movement of infected animals are important parameters to consider.
