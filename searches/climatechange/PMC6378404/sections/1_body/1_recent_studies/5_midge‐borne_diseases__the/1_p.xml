<p class="p">Bluetongue is a noncontagious, midge‐borne viral disease affecting ruminants (mainly sheep and less frequently cattle, goats, antelope, deer, camel, and dromedaries). Bluetongue virus (BTV) is transmitted by

 <italic class="italic">Culicoides</italic> midges (
 <italic class="italic">Culicoides obsoletus</italic>) could transmit BTV in the cold climate of northern Europe and Scandinavia. But in 2006, BTV emerged in northern European farms. From 2006 to 2009, tens of thousands of farms were unexpectedly affected by BTV. This outbreak resulted in a huge financial cost to the European farming industry: about €164–175 million in the Netherlands alone in 2007.

However, in 2015, BTV re‐emerged in central and northern France, and has been present ever since, with livestock movements currently restricted country‐wide in an attempt to contain the area affected.
