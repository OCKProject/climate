<p class="p">When the outbreak started, scientists emphasized that the “2015 El Niño caused exceptional climatic conditions in north‐eastern South America during winter and spring in the Southern Hemisphere.”
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0127" ref-type="ref" class="xref">127</xref> This statement was in agreement with previous studies demonstrating a significant link between the El Niño climate phenomenon, regional climate anomalies, and dengue epidemics in South America and Southeast Asia.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0133" ref-type="ref" class="xref">133</xref> The simulated transmission risk of ZIKV in South America in 2015 was the largest since the 1950s. Risk maps also reveal potential transmission risk in the southern states of the United States, the southern provinces of China, where dengue transmission has already been observed, and to a lesser extent in southern Europe. This work also predicted the spread of ZIKV to Angola; this country was plagued by yellow fever during the Latin American outbreak. ZIKV was found circulating in Angola in subsequent years.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0134" ref-type="ref" class="xref">134</xref> Recent modeling work corroborates these findings at the city‐scale; namely that climatic conditions were optimal for ZIKV transmission in Feira de Santana, Brazil in 2015–16.
