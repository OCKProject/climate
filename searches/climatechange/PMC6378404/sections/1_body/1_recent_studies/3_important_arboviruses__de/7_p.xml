<p class="p">Many other factors synergistically contributed to the severity of the ZIKV epidemic in Latin America in 2015–16. South American and Caribbean populations were very likely fully susceptible to infection before the virus was introduced.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0139" ref-type="ref" class="xref">139</xref> It is very difficult to develop future scenarios for ZIKV risk, given that the level of herd immunity following the large‐scale exposure of human populations should prevent a large outbreak occurring in South America within the upcoming decade.
