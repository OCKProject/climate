 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">101</xref> A recent study highlights that future climate conditions might become increasingly suitable for dengue transmission in southern Europe in the summer.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" class="xref">121</xref> Recent projections carried out for chikungunya show increasingly suitable climatic conditions in temperate regions of Western Europe (France, the Benelux Union, and Germany) for the future.
