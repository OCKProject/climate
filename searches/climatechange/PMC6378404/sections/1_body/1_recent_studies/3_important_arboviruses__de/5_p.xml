<p class="p">In 2015, an outbreak of ZIKV hit Brazil before spreading to most countries in South and Central America and the Caribbean. In subsequent years, ZIKV circulated in a few countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. In summer 2017, limited and local transmission occurred in Texas and Florida in the southern United States. The virus was very likely introduced into northeastern Brazil by a traveler in 2014; the first human case was subsequently detected in May 2015.

WHO declared ZIKV as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in February 2016. The end of this emergency was declared in November 2016 when the number of infected cases significantly declined.
