<p class="p">Recent studies have shown that climatic conditions are increasingly suitable for the transmission of liver fluke in the UK,
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0175" ref-type="ref" class="xref">175</xref> some temperate northern European regions,
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0176" ref-type="ref" class="xref">176</xref> and New Zealand.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" class="xref">177</xref> Interestingly, the number of ruminants infected by liver fluke and other helminths significantly increased during the 2000s in the UK
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0178" ref-type="ref" class="xref">178</xref> and in some European regions. This increase might have been caused by the combination of increasingly suitable environmental conditions combined with an increase in anthelminthic drug resistance.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0179" ref-type="ref" class="xref">179</xref> Future scenarios suggest a lengthening and intensification of the liver fluke transmission season in northern Europe.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0176" ref-type="ref" class="xref">176</xref> Under the most extreme greenhouse gas emission scenario (RCP8.5), fluke burden in Scotland in the 2080s might become as large as currently reported for the most endemic region in the UK, West Wales, and the Valleys. Similar trends are likely for the barber pole worm,
