<p class="p">Schistosomiasis is caused by five species of the flat worm 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma</italic> and requires aquatic snails as intermediate hosts to complete its life cycle. Its global prevalence has increased since the 1950s largely as a result of expansion of irrigation systems in hot climates, where the snail host and parasite can infect human hosts. However, the recent scaling up of distribution of the drug praziquantel to school children and adults in Africa, where most cases occur, has significantly decreased disease prevalence. The parasite and aquatic snail require specific water temperature conditions. In 2015, the first local case of schistosomiasis was reported in Corsica, France.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0181" ref-type="ref" class="xref">181</xref> The availability of competent snail hosts, combined with warm summer temperature conditions, and the importation of the parasite by an infected traveler led to the infection of several family members who were swimming in a river. Climate change is expected to significantly increase infection risk in East Africa by 20% over the next 20–50 years,
