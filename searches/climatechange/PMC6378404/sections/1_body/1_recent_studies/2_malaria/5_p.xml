 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">67</xref> a large epidemic is very unlikely to happen in these regions given the availability of antimalarial drugs and the standard of public health services. However, local transmission of

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">71</xref> A dramatic re‐emergence of malaria cases since 2000 has been observed in the temperate Anhui province of China, prior to which there was very low‐level endemicity. This sudden increase is related to climatic conditions, with rainfall strongly associated with malaria transmission.
