<p class="p">Economic development and the implementation of stringent control and intervention measures have driven a large global decrease in the spatial distribution and endemicity of the disease over the past century. This is despite rising global temperatures,

Current malaria interventions have the ultimate goal of malaria elimination, but are unlikely to be capable of eradicating the disease completely in all regions of Africa, even in current climate conditions.

The extraordinary biological complexity of the malaria parasite has hindered the development of effective vaccines, even though it is well known that transmission‚Äêblocking antiparasite immune responses exist. RTS,S/AS01 is the most advanced malaria vaccine candidate currently in development, and is due to be rolled out in trials in three African countries in 2018.
