<p class="p">The most worrying risk factor affecting malaria is that mosquitoes and parasites are developing resistance to the weapons we use to fight them. Vector resistance to insecticide (DDT), combined with parasite resistance to antimalarial drugs (chloroquine mainly and artemisinin to a lesser extent), is on the rise.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">74</xref> Drug and insecticide resistance might counteract the amazing progress achieved by malaria control measures over the past 15 years. Additionally, most malaria resurgences over the 20th century were related to weakening of malaria control measures; thus, there is an urgent need to deliver practical solutions to financial and operational threats to sustain recent successful malaria control programs.
