<p class="p">The number of Lyme disease cases in Europe has steadily increased from about 3000 in the early 1990s to 35,000 in the late 2000s.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0154" ref-type="ref" class="xref">154</xref> In the United States, similar trends have been observed. Two main tick species, 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic>, the deer tick on the east coast, and 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes pacificus</italic>, on the west coast, transmit Lyme disease in the United States; they both spread farther north between 1996 and 2015.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" class="xref">155</xref> The number of Lyme disease cases has more than doubled in the United States since the 1990s, and Lyme disease is now believed to affect about 300,000 Americans annually. Ogden and others have warned about the potential northern expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> and the diseases it transmits into Canada for more than a decade.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0157" ref-type="ref" class="xref">157</xref> The first infected ticks were found on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie in the early 1990s. 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks have since spread farther north into Ontario, parts of Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0158" ref-type="ref" class="xref">158</xref> The incidence of Lyme disease has increased from 0.4 to 2.7 per 100,000 population from 2009 to 2016 in Canada; 88% of cases were reported in the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Nova Scotia.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">159</xref> Even under an optimistic climate change scenario, for which the global warming increase is limited to 1.5 °C, consistent with the Paris agreement target, Lyme disease was found in simulations to spread farther north in Canada in the future.
 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0160" ref-type="ref" class="xref">160</xref> Northern Russia has also experienced an increase in the 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> tick population and in TBE cases over the past decades.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0162" ref-type="ref" class="xref">162</xref> In particular, a 50‐fold rise in TBE incidence was reported for the far northern province of Arkhangelsk Oblast during the 2000s compared with the 1980s. There was also a distinct correlation between TBE incidence and increases in mean annual air temperatures from 1990 to 2009.
