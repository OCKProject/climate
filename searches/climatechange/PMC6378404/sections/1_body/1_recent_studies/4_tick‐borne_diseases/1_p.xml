 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks can transmit bacteria from the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Borrelia</italic> (causing Lyme disease) and 
 <italic class="italic">Flaviviridae</italic> virus (such as tick‐borne encephalitis, TBE). Lyme disease is the most common VBD affecting humans in the temperate Northern Hemisphere. Rainfall, moisture, and temperature affect the life cycle and habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks, and they prefer habitats with at least 85% relative humidity and search for hosts when the temperature exceeds about 7 °C.
