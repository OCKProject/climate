<p class="p">Other important tick‐borne pathogens (babesiosis, Crimean‐Congo hemorrhagic fever, and rickettsioses) are also climate‐sensitive (for more detailed reviews, see Refs.

 <xref rid="nyas13950-bib-0163" ref-type="ref" class="xref">163</xref>). The patterns described for tick‐borne diseases, including an altitudinal and latitudinal shift of 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks and the diseases they transmit, have been observed in different temperate and peri‐Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere during the past decade. This is related to the direct impact of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> tick habitats, with more conducive temperature conditions and milder winters. Similar trends are likely for these regions in the future if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change. However, this is not the only factor causing tick spread into new habitats; other anthropogenic and natural factors need to be considered. Wild animal hosts (deer, other cervids, birds, and rodents) also carry tick vectors into new regions, and afforestation and land and wildlife management are extremely important potential drivers.
