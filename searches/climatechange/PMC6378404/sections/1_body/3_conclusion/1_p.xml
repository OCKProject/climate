<p class="p">There is a wealth of evidence that recent climate change has already affected pathogen–vector–host systems, in particular over temperate, peri‐Arctic and Artic areas and high altitude regions in the tropics. There are now many examples of the early impacts of climate change on animal VBD burden, while the most severe VBD outbreaks affecting humans tend to be affected by a myriad of complex socioeconomic factors and climate. Our review demonstrates that the spread of vectors and the pathogens they transmit worldwide has been anticipated by scientists. Similar trends are likely in the future if humans fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change and if drug and insecticide resistance continue to rise. On a positive note, significant progress has been achieved in terms of surveillance systems, disease and vector control measures, vaccine development, diagnostic tests, and mathematical risk modeling/mapping in recent decades, thanks to significant funding efforts from governments, non‐governmental organizations (e.g., charities), and patrons from within the private sector (e.g., the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation). Critically, research funding efforts and public health infrastructures need to be sustained if we do not want to repeat the past.</p>
