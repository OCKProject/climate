<p class="p">Microbial communities on the surface of kelp across all treatments were sampled via swabbing each of 2 haphazardly chosen kelp individuals per mesocosm (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 per treatment) at 8, 16 and 31 days after the experiment commenced (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 72), ensuring independent samples of visually healthy tissue through time. An area of 20 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> on the middle section of a secondary lamina (approx. 15 cm from the meristem) was briefly rinsed with filtered (0.22 µm PES syringe filter, Millipore) seawater and swabbed using an autoclaved sterile cotton tip for 30 s [

The swabs were immediately transferred into sterile, DNA-free cryogenic tubes (SSIbio, Scientific Specialties Inc.) and stored at −80°C until DNA extraction. DNA of some samples did not amplify after PCR, resulting in 4–6 replicates per treatment (i.e. 1–2 replicates per mesocosm), totalling 66 samples.
