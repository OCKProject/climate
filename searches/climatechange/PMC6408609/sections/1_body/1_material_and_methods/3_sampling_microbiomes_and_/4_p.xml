<p class="p">To compare microbial communities on healthy and blistered kelps, one independent healthy or blistered section of secondary laminae, each from different kelp individuals, was swabbed on day 16 as described above. Swabs were taken from four plants per condition, haphazardly chosen across mesocosms in each treatment. By the last sampling time (day 31), the sections of blistered tissue had grown, often coalesced, bleached as observed in previous field sampling [
