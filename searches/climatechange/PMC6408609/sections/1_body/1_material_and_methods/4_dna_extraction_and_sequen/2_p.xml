<p class="p">Swabs were transferred to the University of New South Wales (UNSW) in sterile cryo-tubes within liquid nitrogen. Microbial DNA was extracted from each swab using a 96-well PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MO Bio Inc., Carlsbad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer's protocol. DNA extracts were qualified and quantified by agarose gel electrophoresis and spectrophotometry (NanoDrop 1000) and stored at −20°C. Samples were processed and sequenced using standard aseptic procedures and in a random order to avoid contamination and introducing any bias due to order of processing.</p>
