<p class="p">The extracted microbial DNA samples were amplified with PCR using the 16S rDNA primers 27F (5′-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGCTCAG-3′) and 519R (5′-GWATTACCCGCGGCKGCTG-3′), containing V1 to V3 regions of the bacterial and archaeal 16S rRNA gene. PCR controls (no loaded sample) did not amplify DNA, suggesting no contamination during processing and amplification. Amplicons were purified (Zymo DNA-5 Clean Concentrator) before sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq 2000 platform at the Ramaciotti Centre for Genomics (UNSW).</p>
