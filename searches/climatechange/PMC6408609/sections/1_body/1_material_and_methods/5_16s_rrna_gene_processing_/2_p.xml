<p class="p">Raw sequencing data were quality filtered, standardized, classified and then clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using Mothur [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Forward and reverse reads (301 bp) were combined into contigs. Sequences that contained unidentified bases or had greater than 8 homopolymers were filtered out. Remaining sequences were aligned referring to the Silva 16S rRNA gene database [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Sequences that did not align were excluded. Aligned sequences were pre-clustered (diffs = 2) and checked for chimeras using UCHIME [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Singleton and doubleton sequence reads were removed from the dataset to reduce error [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Sequences were then taxonomically classified according to the Silva database with 60% cut-off confidence and clustered into OTUs at a minimum of 97% sequencing identity, resulting in a total of 8401 OTUs. Sequence counts were rarefied to 46 473 reads (total number of high-quality sequences obtained) per sample to account for differences in sequencing depth. Rarefaction curves of the processed sequences were asymptotic, suggesting good coverage of the microbial diversity present (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). To focus analyses on abundant OTUs and reduce the effect of potentially spurious OTUs, those that contributed less than 0.01% of relative abundance were removed from the dataset, resulting in 1887 OTUs for further analyses.
