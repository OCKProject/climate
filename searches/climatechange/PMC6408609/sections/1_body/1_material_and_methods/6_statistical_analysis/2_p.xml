<p class="p">The OTU matrix was analysed using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] in PRIMER v. 6 (PRIMER-E, UK) which compared bacterial and archaeal communities (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) on healthy kelp across treatments for all time points, (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) between condition (healthy versus blistered) and treatments at day 16. The first analysis had temperature (21 versus 23.5°C) and acidification (‘current’ versus ‘future’) as fixed factors and time as a random, orthogonal factor (days 8, 16, 31). The second analysis had kelp condition (healthy versus blistered), temperature and acidification as fixed factors. Random effects of mesocosms were not considered because we only had mostly 1 (sometimes 2) replicates per mesocosm for each treatment combination due to low DNA yield of some samples, so the mesocosms were essentially the replicates. Similarity matrices were calculated based on Bray–Curtis distances on square-root transformed abundance data (‘community structure’), and on Jaccard distances (presence/absence; ‘community composition’). Analyses used 9999 permutations of residuals under a reduced model [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Permutational multivariate dispersion (PERMDISP) analysis was used to test for homogeneity of multivariate dispersion within groups [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) ordinations allowed visualization of microbial community structure under different treatments.
