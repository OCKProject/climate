<p class="p">We compared abundances of each OTU across the different treatments and kelp conditions using multivariate generalized linear models (GLM) assuming a negative binomial distribution in the R statistical package mvabund [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Residual plots were checked to ensure good model fit [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Dozens to hundreds of OTUs were found to significantly differ among the treatments (see Results; electronic supplementary material, tables S2 and S3). We focused on those OTUs where the effect of warming, acidification, kelp condition and/or their combination was strongest, defined here as those for which the absolute effect size was greater than twice the standard deviation (s.d.).
