<p class="p">Univariate generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) were used to compare the number of blisters on kelp among treatments, and the photosynthetic yield of kelp among conditions (healthy, blistered and adjacent to blisters) and treatments at day 16. The numbers of blisters were modelled assuming a Poisson distribution (count data) and photosynthetic yields were modelled assuming a gamma distribution (positive numbers) using the R statistical package lme4 [
