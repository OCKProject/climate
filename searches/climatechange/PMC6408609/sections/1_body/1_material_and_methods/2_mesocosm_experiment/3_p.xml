<p class="p">Each of the 12 mesocosms housed six kelp. The holdfast of each kelp was attached to mesh at the base of a mesocosm with cable-ties fed through silicone tubing to avoid stipe damage [

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> that was pumped from the adjacent ocean, with the inlet located at the site of kelp collection. This flow-through rate ensured that the entire volume of each mesocosm was replaced multiple times a day. Thus, microorganisms in the water would have been continuously refreshed throughout the experiment as in natural conditions. Water temperature was controlled using heater/chiller units (Aquahort Ltd) and pH was manipulated by bubbling in ambient air or CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>-enriched air via a gas mixer (PEGAS 4000MF). The mesocosms experienced natural daily fluctuations in temperature and pH, which varied consistently across treatments, maintaining treatment differences (electronic supplementary material, table S1). Water temperature, conductivity and pH were measured daily in each mesocosm using a Hach HQ40d multi probe calibrated with NIST buffers. Total alkalinity (
