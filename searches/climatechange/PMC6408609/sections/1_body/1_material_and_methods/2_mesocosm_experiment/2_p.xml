 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> individuals (sub-adults, mean biomass 162 ± s.e. 13 g; maximum length approximately 30–60 cm) were haphazardly collected from Charlesworth Bay (30.2677° S, 153.1435° E), Coffs Harbour, Australia, by detaching the holdfasts from the substratum. All collected individuals appeared healthy with no obvious signs of disease or stress. 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> individuals were exposed to warming and acidification in twelve flow-through, fibreglass mesocosms (1100 l, 1.35 m diameter × 0.90 m high) located outdoors and under a shade cloth at the National Marine Science Centre (30.3022° S, 153.1189° E), Coffs Harbour, Australia (see [
