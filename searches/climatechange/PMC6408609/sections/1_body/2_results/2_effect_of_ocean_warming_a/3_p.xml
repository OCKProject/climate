<p class="p">GLM analyses identified 46 OTUs (approx. 2% of a total of 1887 OTUs) whose relative abundances differed significantly among temperature and/or acidification treatments (electronic supplementary material, table S2). Of those, we found a strong (greater than 2 s.d.; Material and methods) main effect of temperature on 4 OTUs that belong to the classes Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria, with abundances generally lower on kelp at 23.5Â°C (electronic supplementary material, figure S2a). Three OTUs were strongly affected by acidification, but the direction of the effect varied, e.g. an OTU belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Aquimarina</italic> was more abundant in the acidification treatments, while the opposite pattern was found for an OTU belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Glaciecola</italic> (electronic supplementary material, figure S2b). We found a strong interactive effect of warming and acidification on 12 OTUs; generally, these OTUs were found in higher abundances on kelp under the higher temperature (e.g. those belonging to the families Rhodobacteraceae and Polaribacter) and/or future pH treatments (e.g. those belonging to the families Flavobacteriaceae and Flammeovirgaceae; electronic supplementary material, figure S2c and table S2).
