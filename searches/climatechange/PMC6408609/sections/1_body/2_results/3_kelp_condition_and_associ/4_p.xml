 <italic class="italic">ca</italic> 450 OTUs (approx. 24%) that differed in abundance between healthy and blistered samples in at least one temperature × acidification treatment combination (electronic supplementary material, table S3), with a strong effect size for 61 of these OTUs (

 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). However, for most OTUs on kelp under the future temperature and acidification combination, abundances on blistered samples did not differ from those on healthy samples (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20181887F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). Some bacterial taxa were consistently dominant on blistered (e.g. OTUs belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Alteromonas</italic> or family Flavobacteriaceae) or healthy (OTUs assigned the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Roseibacillus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Planctomyces</italic>) kelp, independently of the pH and temperature treatments (electronic supplementary material, figure S3a and table S3). Several taxa were also influenced by pH, but the effect was variable: taxa were either found in higher abundances on healthy kelp under both current and future pH (family Pirellulaceae) or just future pH (genus 
 <italic class="italic">Erythrobacter</italic>), or on blistered kelp under current pH (OTUs assigned to the species 
 <italic class="italic">Glaciecola chathamensis</italic>; electronic supplementary material, figure S3b). For most microbial taxa, however, differences in relative abundance between kelp conditions were influenced by temperature (electronic supplementary material, figure S3c and table S3). In most cases, abundances were significantly lower on blistered kelp, particularly at 21°C, although some taxa (e.g. OTUs belonging to the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Thalassomonas</italic> or family Alteromonadaceae) were present in higher abundances on blistered kelp at 21°C than in all other treatments (electronic supplementary material, figure S3c).
