<p class="p">Microbial community structure on blistered kelp differed significantly from that on healthy kelp across all treatments, except for those at future temperature and acidification, which showed a similar structure to healthy kelp (electronic supplementary material, table S6). This pattern was mainly due to differences in relative abundances of OTUs (

 <italic class="italic">b</italic>; electronic supplementary material, table S6). Temperature only affected microbial community structure and composition on blistered kelp subjected to acidification. There was also an effect of acidification on microbial community structure, but only on blistered kelp at 23.5°C (electronic supplementary material, table S6).
