<p class="p">During the second week of the experiment, we observed kelps with clusters of blisters on the tissue of their primary and secondary laminae, which subsequently coalesced and led to tissue bleaching and degradation (

Blistered tissue had a lower photosynthetic yield than healthy tissue adjacent to the blisters or healthy tissue from kelp without blisters, and this localized effect was strongest for kelp under the acidification treatments (
