 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic>. We hypothesized that increases in water temperature and decreases in pH (simulating ocean acidification) would lead to changes in host-associated microbial communities and to diminished condition of the host (i.e. lower photosynthetic efficiency or disease symptoms similar to those observed in the field [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]). We found that tissue of some kelp blistered and subsequently bleached and degraded during the experiment as a result of warming and/or acidification. We then characterized the structure of the microbiome associated with blistered and healthy kelp to examine effects of kelp condition, warming and acidification on microbiomes.
