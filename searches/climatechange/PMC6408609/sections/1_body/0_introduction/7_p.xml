<p class="p">Interactions between 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> and its associated microbiome may contribute to, or even underpin, these declines. Recent surveys throughout the latitudinal distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> identified putative disease phenotypes that were common and widespread. For example, kelp bleaching and associated tissue degradation were quantified in approximately 50% of the individuals in the populations sampled when water temperatures were warmest [

 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> is related to changes in the associated microbiome and increases in abundances of putative pathogens, resulting in a lower photosynthetic capacity of the affected tissue [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Negative interactions between associated microbiomes and host health have also been observed in other, co-occurring Australian seaweeds (e.g. the red seaweed
