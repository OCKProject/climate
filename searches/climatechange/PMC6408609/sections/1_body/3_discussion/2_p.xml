<p class="p">Microbiomes of habitat-formers may be impacted by ocean climate change with implications for the health, persistence and resilience of entire marine ecosystems. We showed that ocean warming and acidification can rapidly affect kelp-associated microbiomes, kelp condition and performance. Kelp individuals developed blisters on the laminae and this putative disease was more prevalent on individuals under acidification treatments. Blistered tissues had lower photosynthetic efficiency and subsequently bleached, similar to phenotypes previously observed in the field [

Given that changes in the microbiomes were rapid and preceded the observed changes in the tissue by several days, this suggests that predicted ocean warming and, in particular, acidification may have strong negative impacts on populations of
