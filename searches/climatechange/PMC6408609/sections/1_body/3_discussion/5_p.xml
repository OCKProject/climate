<p class="p">Environmental changes have been linked to microbial diseases in other key habitat-formers including corals [

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], and our understanding of negative host–microbiome interactions on seaweeds is increasing [

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Microbial diseases have recently been characterized in stressed populations of habitat-forming seaweeds in SE Australia, including the red alga 
 <italic class="italic">Delisea pulchra</italic> (bacterial disease) and the canopy-forming fucoid 
 <italic class="italic">Phyllospora comosa</italic> (endophytic fungal disease), in response to warming and around urbanized areas [

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Such diseases can affect survival, photosynthetic efficiency, fecundity and influence greater consumption and host-use by herbivores [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In previous studies, we have identified putative pathogens and found a strong relationship between the structure and composition of microbiomes and host performance for 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> throughout its latitudinal distribution in Australia [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], combined with an increase in kelp bleaching with temperature [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Thus, ocean warming may lead to increased frequency and severity of bleaching in 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> via direct physiological impacts combined with a disruption of the microbiome. Apart from observing changes in microbiomes in response to warming in the present experiment, we did not detect any measurable effects of temperature on the prevalence of kelp blistering (numbers of blisters). This could be partly a function of quantifying the number of blisters rather the overall area of tissue impacted because, as the blisters grew in size, they coalesced with other blisters to form larger affected bleached areas similar to those observed in the field when water temperature is warmest [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, quantification of the total area affected may have also potentially revealed an effect of temperature. Alternatively, this could be due to kelp already experiencing similar temperatures at the end of summer or during localized heatwaves. Kelp may be more resilient to warming than acidification, although recent studies show that exposure to warm temperatures similar to the one used here can affect kelp condition and survival leading to significant kelp declines [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Additionally, different stages in the life history of kelp are likely to respond to environmental changes differently, and thus responses by adults may not reflect those by early life stages (e.g. recruits), which can be less tolerant.
