<p class="p">Differences among treatments were driven by abundances of approximately 20% of the OTUs, of which even fewer showed large effect sizes (less than 5%). The presence of a small ‘core’ set of taxa associated with differences in host properties is consistent with other studies on marine microbial diseases [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and on seaweed-associated microbial communities in general [

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Several taxa identified belonged to genera or families of marine pathogens associated with bleached

 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Alteromonas</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aquimarina</italic>, Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteriaceae), suggesting that multiple taxa may cause changes in host condition. Some of these strains have been used in inoculation experiments with

 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Similar experiments are necessary to establish a causal link between the observed changes in abundances of these and other taxa, and functional changes and the development of blistering in
