<p class="p">Of particular interest was, however, the finding that microbial community structure associated with blistered tissue differed markedly from that associated with healthy tissue in most treatments except for the combination of future temperature and acidification (i.e. the future scenario), where microbiomes resembled those on healthy kelp. These results may be caused by ocean warming and acidification having independent, yet antagonistic effects on microbial communities. As more studies simultaneously test for the impacts of ocean warming and acidification using factorial designs, it is becoming increasingly apparent that warming and acidification have independent effects on biological response variables, rather than interactive effects (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]). When the direction of the effects of ocean warming and acidification oppose each other, they tend to moderate, rather than exacerbate, the impacts of ocean climate change [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. While these types of opposing effects have been demonstrated for univariate biological response variables (e.g. coralline growth/health [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]), our data suggest that this could also be the case for entire microbial communities. Alternatively, it is possible that the microorganisms initially responsible for affecting the condition of the host were unable to withstand the combination of warming and acidification. This model is interesting as it implies that some of the currently known marine microbial pathogens may be less infective (or not infective at all) under future, more stressful environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. However, the exposure to such conditions will be gradual, rather than abrupt as in this short-term experiment, allowing for evolutionary processes to take place [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Indeed, microbial communities can have the capacity to adapt rapidly to changing environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. It is therefore possible that both host and microbiome may gradually adapt to the future ocean warming and acidification conditions modelled in this study, making predictions based on short-term studies such as this one challenging. Small-scale, short-term experimental manipulations are a powerful tool to determine causality, but it is hard to generalize observed effects in such experiments, particularly where other trophic levels and/or large-scale processes (e.g. ocean currents/eddies) are ignored. Combining short-term experiments with longer-term field sampling, or using space-for-time substitutions at appropriate locations [
