<p class="p">The prevalence of blisters on kelp was strongly influenced by acidification. This may be due to direct, physiological effects of this stressor on the kelp, which could have led, in turn, to changes in the microbiome and disease, although some blistering was also observed in other treatments albeit in significantly lower numbers. Alternatively, changes in the microbiome may have been a direct response to acidification at the beginning of the experiment, and may have subsequently led to blistering of the kelp. Changes in kelp-associated microbiomes were observed before changes in the condition of the kelp, suggesting an indirect effect of acidification on kelp condition, that is, via changes in the microbiome.</p>
