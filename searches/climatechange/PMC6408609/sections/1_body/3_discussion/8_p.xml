<p class="p">Contamination can be an issue in microbial studies. We controlled for this in part by PCR (negative) controls and the use of sterile equipment and aseptic procedures, which in amplicon sequencing studies reduce the likelihood of contamination, and are standard and accepted practice in mensurative or manipulative studies [

In our experiment samples were collected, extracted, amplified and sequenced randomly; thus, any potential contamination in the sterile commercial kits or throughout this process would have affected all treatments in an unbiased way. The specifics of our results also argue against confounding by contamination. For example, for such contamination to influence the reversion of treatments under future climatic conditions to current ones, there would have to have been contamination from marine bacteria at a sufficient level in pre-sterilized kits in all samples of the future conditions treatment, that matched the specific community composition of the communities in the treatments subject to current climatic conditions. Therefore, it is very unlikely that observed differences of communities/taxa among treatments were due to contamination.
