<p class="p">The putative disease—blistering, bleaching, tissue degradation—observed here could have resulted from a mesocosm effect (i.e. moving kelp from the natural environment into mesocosms), although numbers varied among treatments. We were not able to sample field populations at the time of the experiment to assess blistering or bleaching levels; however, we have observed kelp bleaching and tissue degradation in many 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> populations along the continent [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], not related to photobleaching or tissue loss following reproduction, but which resembles the bleaching and degradation that followed the blistering in this experiment. Similar diseases have been observed in other seaweeds in the field, for example gall/blister development and discoloration on fronds of the fucoid 
 <italic class="italic">Durvillaea antarctica</italic> in Chile in response to parasite infections [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. This and the higher prevalence of blistering and subsequent bleaching of kelp in treatments simulating future ocean conditions suggest that the putative disease observed in our mesocosm experiment is likely to occur in natural populations. Alternatively, kelp may be primarily influenced by acidification rather than temperature, and may only become prevalent in the field once the ocean becomes more acidic. As with all mesocosm experiments, interpretation of results may be affected by the nature of the mesocosm, relative to the natural environment. Here, some effects could have been due to an increased probability of colonization of pathogens from the water (which were not monitored) onto the kelp surfaces, such as if warming and/or acidification would have led to an increase in water pathogens. However, any such confounding issues are unlikely for several reasons. First, previous studies have shown very distinct communities in the water from those associated to any live surface, including 
 <italic class="italic">Ecklonia</italic> [
 <xref rid="RSPB20181887C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. It is unlikely therefore that changes in the microorganisms in the water, if any, would have resulted in changes in the surface-associated communities. Second, the entire volume of each mesocosm was replaced multiple times a day with water collected from the kelp-collection site. Thus, microorganisms in the water would have been continuously refreshed, reflecting natural changes in the site where the kelp was collected. In addition, differences between treatments were due to differences in relative abundances of taxa already present on the kelp surfaces, rather than differences in presence or absence of taxa.
