<p class="p">A recent study focused on 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, United Kingdom, and the United States, totaling 74,225,200 deaths in different periods between 1985 and 2012 (

In total, 7.71% [95% confidence interval (CI): 7.43%, 7.91%] of mortality was attributed to suboptimal temperature in these countries, with substantial differences between them, from 3.37% in Thailand to 11.47% in Italy. Most of the deaths were probably attributable to cold [7.29% (95% CI: 7.03%, 7.49%)] and heat [0.42% (95% CI: 0.39%, 0.44%)]. Extreme cold and hot temperatures were only responsible for 0.86% (95% CI: 0.84%, 0.87%) of total mortality. Most of the temperature-related mortality burden seemed to be attributable to the contribution of cold. The impact of days of extreme temperature was far less than that attributed to milder, long-lasting but suboptimal weather. These findings are controversial as the data on some confounders (e.g., influenza) were not available. We believe that further research is still required to better understand a net benefit from temperature changes. Despite its limitations, this evidence may have important implications for the planning of public health interventions to minimize the health consequences of adverse temperatures at present, and also for predicting the future impact under climate change scenarios. For example, there is evidence that deaths attributable to cold and hot temperature will substantially shift as climate change proceeds (
