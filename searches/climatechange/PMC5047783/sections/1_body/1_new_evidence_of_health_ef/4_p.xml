<p class="p">The World Health Organization (WHO) recently conducted a quantitative risk assessment of effects of climate change on selected causes of death (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WHO 2015</xref>) and concluded that climate change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050; of these, 38,000 will be due to heat exposure among the elderly, 48,000 to diarrheal disease, 60,000 to malaria, and 95,000 to undernourished children. These risk estimates may largely be conservative because of the scant number of empirical studies on the health impacts of climate change, particularly from low-income countries (
