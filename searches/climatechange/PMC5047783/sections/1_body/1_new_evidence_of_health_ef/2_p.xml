<p class="p">Another important area of research is to assess the temperature-related mortality and morbidity. An international research team evaluated global variation in the effects of ambient temperature on mortality and found that the temperatures associated with the lowest mortality ranged from the 66th (Taiwan) to the 80th (United Kingdom) percentile (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al. 2014</xref>). Although the estimated effects of cold and hot temperatures on mortality varied by community and country, meta-analysis results showed that both cold and hot temperatures increased the risk of mortality in all twelve countries and regions. Cold effects were delayed and lasted for many days, whereas heat effects appeared quickly and did not last long. 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guo et al. (2014)</xref> concluded that people have some ability to adapt to their local climate type, but both cold and hot temperatures are still associated with increased risk of mortality. Global climate change will not only increase average surface temperature but also aggravate climate variability (
