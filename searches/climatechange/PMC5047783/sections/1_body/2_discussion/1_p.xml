<p class="p">Human health is already affected by climate change, and its effects will increase over time. In the longer term, a greater health hazard for many populations will arise from disturbances to environmental, ecological, and social living conditions. As the protection and improvement of human health is one of the ultimate goals of sustainable development, epidemiologists and public health professionals should play an active role in the development of plans for reducing the adverse health effects of climate change at national, regional, and international levels, just like the phasing out of lead from gasoline and taking actions to slow down stratospheric ozone depletion.</p>
