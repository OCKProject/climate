<p class="p">Climate change is increasingly recognized as the biggest global health threat (

Understanding its present and future impacts on population health is of vital scientific and public health importance locally, nationally, and internationally. To date, public concerns and scientific endeavors focused largely on the risks of climate change to economic productivity, livelihoods, tourism, infrastructure, and valued species (

For example, pollinators are a key component of global biodiversity, providing vital ecosystem services to crops and wild plants. Global pollinator declines are reported to be associated with habitat loss and fragmentation, agrochemicals, pathogens, alien species, and climate change (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Potts et al. 2010</xref>). There is now an increasing recognition of its potential risks to human health that are not only related to disasters but also to significant changes in climate systems such as increasing temperatures and altered rainfall patterns. Tackling climate change could be the greatest global health opportunity of this century. Many mitigation and adaptation responses to climate change could lead to direct reductions in the burden of ill health, enhance community resilience, alleviate poverty, and address global inequity (
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watts et al. 2015</xref>). To address the scale and immediacy of the threat of climate change to human health and well-being, there is an urgent need to develop evidence-informed policy guidelines for action.
