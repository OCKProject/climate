<p class="p">The cpDNA genome is characterized by its slow evolution caused by low mutation rate (Palmer &amp; Herbon, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Thus, the observed high haplotype diversity (

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> &gt; 0.2) that is coupled with very low gene flow indicates that yellowhorn populations have been isolated for a very long time and may undergo further habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, while the mode of inheritance of yellowhorn's chloroplast is unknown, it is expect to be material as most angiosperms (Reboud &amp; Zeyl, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), thus limiting gene flow due to the species large seed (Wang, Huang et al.,
