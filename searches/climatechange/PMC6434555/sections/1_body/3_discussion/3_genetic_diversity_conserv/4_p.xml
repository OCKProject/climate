<p class="p">Wild yellowhorn often found in Versant Soleil occupying forest edges presumably for sunlight accessibility (personal field observation). This habitat distribution type is more sensitive to edge effects and habitat fragmentation which may be exasperated by global warming (Reinmann &amp; Hutyra, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and consequently contributing to woody plant ecosystem's properties and thus changing the habitat of animals associated with long‚Äêdistance dispersal (LDD). Thus, the migration and evolution of yellowhorn are expected to face natural and anthropogenic biogeographic barriers (Lumibao, Hoban, &amp; McLachlan, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).
