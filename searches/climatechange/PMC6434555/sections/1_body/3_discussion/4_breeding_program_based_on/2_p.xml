 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>)), there is large potential for planting yellowhorn. The main advantage of planting yellowhorn is the species ability to grow on marginal sites, thus does not compete on fertile land distant for other crops creating an economic and environmental “win–win” scenario (Wang, Huang et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). To enhance to development of yellowhorn planting, the Chinese government sponsored the “11th Five‐Year Plan” to ensure planting of more than 105 ha per year until 2020 (Yu et al.,
