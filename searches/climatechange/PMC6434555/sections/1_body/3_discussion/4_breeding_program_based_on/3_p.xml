<p class="p">In reality, the selection and breeding of yellowhorn have started in 1970s, with traditional breeding methods following the recurrent selection scheme with its selection, breeding, and testing cycles. Presently, with the availability of affordable genomic markers and advanced computational methods, a more efficient breeding methods such as genomic selection (GS) could be implemented (Meuwissen, Hayes, &amp; Goddard, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). This approach is expected to reduce traditional tree breeding methods’ protracted timelines and their dependence on sustained financial and administrative commitments (El‐Dien et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). It should be highlighted that the peculiar reproductive nature of yellowhorn (known as the species with “thousand flowers but one fruit” (Ding &amp; Ao, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>)) and alternative deployment methods through vegetative propagation are required to overcome the reproductive approach drawbacks (El‐Kassaby &amp; Klapště, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We feel that the adoption of genomic selection for identifying superior individuals and the implementation of vegetative propagation scheme (e.g., root cutting (Yao, Qi, &amp; Yin, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>)) will lead to a faster yellowhorn population development.
