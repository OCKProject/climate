<p class="p">The advantage of genomic selection is its utility to domestic as well as wild populations. Conducting GS in wild populations offers opportunities and challenges. Opportunities include capitalizing on historical linkage disequilibrium between target traits and SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism; Neale &amp; Savolainen, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>), high selection intensity (many individuals to select from), utilizing natural mating thus bypassing conventional breeding, availability of genetic analyses to estimate traits heritability after pedigree reconstruction (El‐Kassaby &amp; Lstibůrek, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and extensive phenotypic variability, collectively all expect to advance the genetic gain for the target traits. On the other hand, the main challenges are age and environmental heterogeneity differences and these could be dealt with tree aging and statistical methods that account for spatial heterogeneity (Cappa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Previous research has shown that yellowhorn oil contains unsaturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs: oleic, linoleic, gondoic, erucic, and nervoic acid (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>)) which is been widely used as edible oil, and in cosmetics, medicine, and biofuel (Venegas‐Calerón, Ruíz‐Méndez, Martínez‐Force, Garcés, &amp; Salas, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Thus, these attributes will form the foundation for phenotyping of economically valuable attributes during the implementation of GS. To maximize the chances for success, we propose implementing GS on the six identified “hotspots” wild yellowhorn populations.
