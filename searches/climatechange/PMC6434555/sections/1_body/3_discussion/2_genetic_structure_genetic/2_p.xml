<p class="p">In the present analyses, wild yellowhorn populations maintained high haplotype diversity (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> = 0.760, 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 4.616) compared to other species (average haplotype diversity for 170 species is 0.67 (Petit et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>)) and high genetic difference (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.893), but very low gene flow (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> = 0.03) among the studied 38 populations, while no individual population value of Tajima's D was significantly different from random expectations. Similar results also found in other long‐lived tree species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Alsophila spinulosa</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.92, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> = 0.09 (Su et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>); 
 <italic class="italic">Taxus wallichiana</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.884 with low levels of recurrent gene flow (Gao et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>)). This may be associated with the long evolutionary history for woody species. Genetic diversity is controlled by four processes, including mutation, drift, migration, and selection (Hoisington et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Tajima's D is widely used to evaluate the pattern of demographic processes within species (genetic bottlenecks (or genetic drift) and founder effects), which may cause population structure and selection (Mahoney, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Ptak &amp; Przeworski, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Negative and positive values of within populations Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> indicate that populations have undergone demographic expansions and experienced bottlenecks, respectively (Tajima, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). According to our results, populations 6, 17, 22, 23, 24, 29, and 38 may have undergone demographic expansions under historical climate change, while populations 10, 11, 26, 28, 31, and 34 may have experienced bottlenecks during their evolutionary journey.
