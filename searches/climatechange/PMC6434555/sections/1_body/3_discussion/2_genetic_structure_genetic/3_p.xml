<p class="p">Fruit of yellowhorn form capsules, those capsules disclose when ripe (July–August), the capsule shells become hard and woody. These fruits contain on average 15–25 seeds (with hard seed coats) (Zhou &amp; Liu, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and mean single seed weight is around 0.87 g (Wang, Huang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wang, Yang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). As in most plant species, relatively heavy seed is dispersed within short distance (dozen meters) (Willson, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). The evolution of plants is affected by long‐distance dispersal (LDD). LDD is influenced by several factors including the presence of open terrestrial landscapes and mediation by large animals, migratory animals, extreme meteorological events, ocean currents, and human transportation (Nathan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) as well as extreme phenomenon such as glaciation and continental drift (Smith,
