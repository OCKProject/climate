<p class="p">Breeding practices often focus on a subset of the base population, thus effectively reducing the genetic diversity (Chaisurisri &amp; El‐Kassaby,

 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>); however, breeding activities should be viewed as a component of larger gene resource management strategy aimed at fulfilling both utilization and conservation goals. Wild genetic resources substantially contribute to conventional crop improvement efforts (e.g., wheats and maize (Hoisington et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>)) and it should be noted that substantial numbers of the selected and deployed valuable varieties originated from landraces or nature individuals (Hoisington et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Historically, tree selective breeding is a young practice started in 1950s, indicating that the state of forest tree genetic resources is still resembling their wild ancestors (White, Adams, &amp; Neale, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Most tree selective breeding efforts are mainly focused on economically valuable attributes with emphases on increasing yield and to a lesser extent quality. Exploring future tree genetic resources is anticipated to include additional attributes such as wood quality, drought, frost, and pest resistant or tolerance, and fruit yield and taste.
