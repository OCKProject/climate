<p class="p">Climate change may affect the genetic diversity within and among populations and thus impacting species’ evolutionary potential (Vellend &amp; Geber, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). The current observed rate of climate change is faster than that of postglacial warming (Willis &amp; MacDonald, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and is considered as a pervasive global problem (Hegerl et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Thus, the reliance on long‐term evolutionary factors for creating new genes is not an option. To preserve yellowhorn's known and unknown valuable gene pools, the identification of the species genetic diversity “hotspots” is a prerequisite for their consideration as in situ conservation high priority (Shafer, Cullingham, Cote, &amp; Coltman, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Weiss &amp; Ferrand, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Additionally, predicting the magnitude of climate change and its impact on the genetic diversity within these “hotspots” is essential for the species future utilization and conservation strategies.
