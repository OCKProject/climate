<p class="p">Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is haploid and nonrecombining genome (Comes &amp; Kadereit, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>), usually maternally inherited in most angiosperms such as Theaceae (Li, Awasthi, Yang, &amp; Li,

 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). cpDNA has been widely used in phylogeny, classification, and biogeography of many plant species (Olmstead &amp; Palmer, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). In this study, we used cpDNA sequencing from five noncoding regions to assess haplotype diversity and relationship in 399 yellowhorn individuals representing 38 wild populations. We focused on three issues: (a) uncover the genetic diversity, genetic structure, and phylogenetic relationships; (b) identify the genetic diversity “hotspots” and conservation role under climate change; and (c) utility of breeding with valuable genotypes.
