<p class="p">The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) recognized the need for biodiversity conservation at its three levels: genetic, species, and ecosystem (McNeely, Miller, Reid, Mittermeier, &amp; Werner, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). Conservation of genetic diversity is fundamental for species and ecosystem scales (Frankham, Ballou, &amp; Briscoe, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The importance of genetic diversity can be addressed as to reducing inbreeding depression (Frankham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), providing fundamental resources for species evolution (Frankel &amp; Bennett, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>), enhancing population fitness, and decreasing extinction risk (Vellend &amp; Geber, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Although genetic diversity conservation was proposed as an explicit goal in 1993 (Burhenne‐Guilmin &amp; Casey‐Lefkowitz, 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), the conservation of genetic resources only focused on species of recognized value to humans. However, the value of vast genetic resources may still remain unknown and has been described as “sitting on the shelf” or “gene morgues” (Hoisington et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), such as those of yellowhorn (
