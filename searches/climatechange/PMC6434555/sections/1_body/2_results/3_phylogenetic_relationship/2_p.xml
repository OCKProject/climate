<p class="p">Based on Bayes (posterior probabilities &gt;0.9), maximum parsimony (MP), and maximum likelihood (ML) (bootstrap value &gt;50%), the phylogenetic relationships among the 24 yellowhorn cpDNA microsatellite haplotypes showed similar results (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34944-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Five major clusters (clade A, B, C, D, and E) were observed along with 
 <italic class="italic">Koelreuteria paniculata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Aesculus assamica</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Acer coriaceifolium</italic> as out‚Äêgroups. Clade A (H3, H4, H5, H6, H9, H10, H11, H12, H13, H17, H20, and H21) is mainly distributed in the northern part of Luliang (Shanxi Province) and Taihang (mainly in Hebei and partially in Henan and Shanxi Provinces) Mountains, B (H14 and H15) is representative of the Taiyuan Basin (Taiyuan Province), C (H7) located in northeastern Qinling Mountain (Shaanxi Province) and east of the Yellow River, D (H8, H16, and H18) representing the western part of Luliang Mountain (Shanxi Province), and E (H1, H2, H19, H22, H23, and H24) distributed in the western part of Ziwuling Mountain (Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces). The 24 cpDNA microsatellite haplotypes network analysis indicated that there are 6 mutation steps between H7 and H14, 5 steps between H7 and H9, and 3 steps between each of H7 and H23, H8 and H23, and H1 and H19 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34944-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Haplotype H1 is commune in the southwestern region while haplotype diversity is increasing from southwest to northeast (Figures
