<p class="p">Based on the canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination results, 12 (mean annual temperature (MAT), mean warmest month temperature (MWMT), mean coldest month temperature (MCMT), temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT (TD), degree‐days below 0°C (DD &lt; 0), degree‐days above 5°C (DD5), degree‐days above 18°C (DD &lt; 18), number of frost‐free days (NFFD), precipitation as snow (PAS), extreme minimum temperature over 30 years (EMT), extreme maximum temperature over 30 years (EXT), and Hargreaves reference evaporation (Eref)) out of the 16 studied climate factors significantly associated with haplotype distribution (Figure

 <xref rid="ece34944-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). MAT, MWMT, MCMT, DD5, DD18, NFFD, EMT, EXT, and Eref aggregated on the positive side of the CCA1 axis, while TD, DD &lt; 0, DD &lt; 18, and PAS aggregated on the negative side (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34944-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Among the studied climate factors, MCMT, TD, DD &lt; 0, and EMT showed highly significant positive (or negative) association with the cpDNA microsatellite haplotypes distribution. Both TD and EMT in the identified haplotype diversity “hotspots” (populations with high haplotype diversity, including populations 10, 11, 17, 22, 24, 38) will increase by 3 to 5°C in the following 50 years (Figure
