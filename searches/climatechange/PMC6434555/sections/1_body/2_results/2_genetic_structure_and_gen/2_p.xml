<p class="p">A total of 24 haplotypes were found in the 399 individuals representing the 38 wild yellowhorn populations with 21 populations producing only one single haplotype (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34944-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34944-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the 38 populations, three haplotypes (H1 (174/399), H9 (66/399), and H11 (54/399)) were widely distributed and accounted for 74% and 82% of the total investigated individuals and populations, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34944-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> a and b). The yellowhorn maintained high genetic diversity across the 38 populations (haplotype diversity (

 <sub class="sub">d</sub>) = 0.760; average number of nucleotide differences (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>) = 4.616, with six populations (#10, 11, 17, 22, 24, and 38) harboring high haplotype diversity (

 <sub class="sub">d</sub>: ranged between 0.600 and 0.705) and could be recognized as genetic “hotspots” (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34944-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The mean

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> (population subdivision) and

 <sub class="sub">m</sub> (gene flow) were 0.893 and 0.03, respectively, indicating that the observed genetic difference mainly occurred among rather than within populations. Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> neutrality test varied among the 38 populations but did not differ significantly from zero (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34944-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
