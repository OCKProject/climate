Most of the sampled areas are located on the Loess Plateau, an arid or semi‐arid region, with 200–700 mm of annual precipitation, and occupy an elevational band between 800 and 2,200 m. From each individual tree, a fresh sample of 2–10 leaves was collected and stored in silica gel until further use. Due to the vegetative propagation nature of yellowhorn that often creates clonal clumps, sampled trees were intentionally separated by a minimum distance of 100 m (Song, Yin, Liu, Wang, &amp; Jiao,
