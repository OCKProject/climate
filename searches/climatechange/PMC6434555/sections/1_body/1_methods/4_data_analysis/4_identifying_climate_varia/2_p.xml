<p class="p">We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) ordination to identify the climate variables that are correlated with the distribution of haplotype diversity. CCA was calculated by the “cca” function in package “vegan” in R 3.3.1 (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34944-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), and it is based on chi‐squared distances and performs weighted linear mapping. In CCA, “species matrix” is the haplotype abundance in populations. A total of 16 climate variables (MAT: mean annual temperature (°C); MWMT: mean warmest month temperature (°C); MCMT: mean coldest month temperature (°C); TD: temperature difference between MWMT and MCMT, or continentality (°C); MAP: mean annual precipitation (mm); MSP: mean summer (May–September) precipitation (mm); AHM: annual heat moisture index (MAT + 10)/(MAP/1,000); DD &lt; 0: degree‐days below 0°C, chilling degree‐days; DD &gt; 5: degree‐days above 5°C, growing degree‐days; DD &lt; 18: degree‐days below 18°C, heating degree‐days; DD &gt; 18: degree‐days above 18°C, cooling degree‐days; NFFD: the number of frost‐free days; PAS: precipitation as snow (mm) between August in previous year and July in current year; EMT: extreme minimum temperature over 30 years; Eref: Hargreaves reference evaporation; CMD: Hargreaves climatic moisture deficit) were determined for present, 2050, and 2070 for each population using the software package Climate AP (Wang, Wang, Innes, Seely, &amp; Chen,
