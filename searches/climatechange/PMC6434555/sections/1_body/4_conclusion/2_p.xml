<p class="p">The genetic structure and diversity of 38 yellowhorn wild populations were assessed using 399 individuals representing 7 provinces covering the species’ natural range. We use cpDNA microsatellite haplotype variation to determine the species contemporary variation and its population differentiation as affected by postglacial migration and the anticipated global warming. Six genetic diversity “hotspots” were identified and deemed important for high conservation priority. A utilization (breeding) and conservation initiative is proposed.</p>
