<p class="p">This paper argues that the potential impact of climate change mitigation strategies on animal welfare should be acknowledged and considered in the ongoing debate and discussion centered on climate change approaches and climate change research, with the aim of maximizing co-benefits of sustainability while avoiding negative tradeoffs. Specific mitigation strategies are discussed and their potential impacts on the animals are assessed. As examples of alternative pathways forward, some mitigation approaches that have no effect on animal welfare or even a positive effect are also reviewed. Given the scope and severity of the impacts on animals, and the increasing global support for more welfare-friendly practices, animal welfare concerns should become a more prominent part of the dialog and policy decisions on climate change mitigation practices in animal agriculture.</p>
