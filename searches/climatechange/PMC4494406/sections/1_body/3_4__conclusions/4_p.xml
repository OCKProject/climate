<p class="p">Calls to globalize the production systems that were developed in the West are concerning when the impacts on the animals are taken into account, and there is worldwide momentum toward abandoning the worst practices. For example, multinational corporations such as McDonalds, Compass Group, and Nestle are asking producers for plans to eliminate gestation crates from their supply chains. Legislative and voluntary phase-outs of intensive animal confinement systems are increasingly taking hold across the globe, for example in the European Union, South Africa, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and several US states, with active campaigns in many additional regions of the world. The global movement toward farm animal welfare reform must be an important consideration going forward in the discussion of climate change mitigation strategies, and research and policy should increasingly reflect this.</p>
