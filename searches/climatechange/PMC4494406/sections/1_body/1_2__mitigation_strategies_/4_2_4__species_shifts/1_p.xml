<p class="p">In addition to increasing productivity within species, the current global trend toward intensively producing greater numbers of non-ruminant animals—pigs and chickens—is often viewed as a more efficient form of meat production compared to traditional ruminant cattle, sheep and goat rearing systems [

 <xref rid="B13-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], the expansion in supply is largely coming from increased local production, as opposed to from imports [
 <xref rid="B12-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and in these regions, livestock systems are rapidly shifting toward monogastric species. Pigs and poultry account for 77% of the expansion in production, a trend that is often accompanied by intensification, vertical integration, geographic concentration, up-scaling of production, and feeding more grain- or concentrate-based diets [
