<p class="p">According to the FAO, the single most effective GHG mitigation strategy in many regions of the world is to increase animal productivity [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] (p. 100). Raising imported animals selected for production traits, instead of traditional breeds is part of that strategy. However, the FAO also cautions that while achieving the genetic potential of highly productive breeds is important, these animals should not be imported into environments where climate or management limitations would prevent the animals from achieving this potential. In new regions or countries, animals from genetic lines with high production potential may actually perform worse than native breeds or crossbreeds, especially compared to those well-adapted to local disease and climactic conditions [
 <xref rid="B10-animals-05-00361" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] (p. 104). Some regions have seasonal fluctuations in feed quality and nutrient management, and, as high genetic merit breeds have exacting nutritional requirements, they do not always thrive as expected.
