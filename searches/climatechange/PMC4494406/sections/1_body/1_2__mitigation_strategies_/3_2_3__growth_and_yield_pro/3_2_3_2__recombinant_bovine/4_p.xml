<p class="p">The debate between researchers in different countries largely centers on the question of whether increases in mastitis are due to rbST treatment 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> or to the increase in productivity caused by rbST, the same as would be expected when genetic selection leads to greater milk production. White 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (1994) argue that treatment differences in mastitis are within the range predicted using estimates from genetic studies. And using this logic they conclude that rbST treatment had no effect on mastitis [
