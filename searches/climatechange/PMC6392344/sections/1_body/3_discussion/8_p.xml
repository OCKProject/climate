<p class="p">Length of growing season might be the core factor that affects maximum attainable seed mass because a longer growing season provides more time for nutrient accumulation than a shorter growing season (Moles &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, selection will thus be more likely to favor large seeds in wet tropical environments, where a high‐energy period extends for all or most of the year. However, for species in the desert there is limited time to complete their lifespan and to produce large seeds (Volis &amp; Bohrer, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The nonsignificant relationship between seed size and mean germination percentage at different temperature/water stress conditions in our study suggests that regardless of their seed size most species in the desert steppe have the ability to germinate under low temperature and drought stress in the early season, which would increase plant fitness by increasing growing time. Our results do not support the general assumption that large‐seeded species necessarily germinate to higher percentages than small‐seeded species (Easton &amp; Kleindorfer, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Grime et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>; Norden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Rees, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Venable &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). However, our results are consistent with those of a study of 1795 species at the global scale reporting that the distributions of seed mass of species with dormant and nondormant seeds strongly overlaps (Jurado &amp; Flores, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In addition, our study also is consistent with a study of foreland species in the Austrian Central Alps showing no correlation between the ranking of species according to seed mass and optimum temperature for germination (Schwienbacher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
