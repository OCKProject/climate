<p class="p">In addition, seed size is expected to be positively correlated with the ability to germinate under osmotic stress. Most research has concluded that large seeds buffer seedling growth from some of the negative effects of drought stress (Leishman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), and experimental evidence for the advantage of large seeds for establishment under low soil moisture conditions has been reported (Leishman &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). However, the relationships between germination under drought stress and seed size might differ among ecosystems. Therefore, determining the relationship between seed germination and seed size is important for predicting future community structures from this important seed trait (i.e., seed size). In our study, seeds of all species originated from the same temperate arid habitat with only 280Â mm annual precipitation, in which most species are exposed to drought stress. Our findings of nonsignificant relationships between seed germination under drought stress and seed size are consistent with results for communities in other temperature regions such as a woodland in Massachusetts (USA) showing that seed size does not have a significant effect on emergence time of

 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>), and a glacier foreland in the Austrian Central Alps showing that seed mass does not correspond with germination along a temperature gradient (Schwienbacher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). These studies, together with ours, suggest that seed germination in the temperate region may be more related to local environmental conditions or genetic heterogeneity than to seed size (Jones et al.,
