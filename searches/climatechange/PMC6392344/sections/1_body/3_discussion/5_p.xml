<p class="p">Our results are consistent with the empirical data of winter annuals in Sonoran Desert showing that coexisting species differ in their germination response to varying temperature and precipitation (Adondakis &amp; Venable, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Therefore, the difference in the responses of germination to water stress between species in our desert steppe community spreads germination timing, which could mitigate the crowding effect in the resource‚Äêlimited (e.g., water) ecosystem. Furthermore, species partition their regeneration niche through different responses to seasonal temperature regime and drought stress (Chesson &amp; Huntly,
