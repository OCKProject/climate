<p class="p">Rainfall in deserts and steppes can vary substantially among years in both amount and timing, and thus successful seedling establishment may be followed by complete reproductive failure (Beatley,

Therefore, germination under drought stress is a high‐risk strategy since the seedlings may die if the amount of follow‐up precipitation is not enough to support seedling growth. At the community level, this risk could be spread by heterogeneous germination under drought stress among species.
