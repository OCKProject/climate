<p class="p">Theoretical models predict that small seeds are more likely to delay germination than large seeds (Rees, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>; Venable &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Compared with small seeds, large‐seeded species have high fitness due to high seedling survival (Westoby, Falster, Moles, Vesk, &amp; Wright, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), rapid seedling growth (Moles &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Verdú &amp; Traveset, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and an amplified tolerance against hazards such as drought and frost (Coomes &amp; Grubb, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Some studies have reported that germination and establishment success increase with increasing seed mass in a variety of environmental conditions (Jakobsson &amp; Eriksson, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Moles, Westoby, &amp; Eriksson, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). In addition, large seeds with large reserves of stored food produce larger seedlings that can perform better under unfavorable conditions than seedlings from small seeds (Kitajima &amp; Fenner, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Our results showed that there was no significant relationship between seed germination and seed size. However, there is much variation with regard to whether large or small seeds germinate best (Baskin &amp; Baskin,
