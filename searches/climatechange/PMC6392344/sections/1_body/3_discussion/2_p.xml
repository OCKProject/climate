<p class="p">In our study, species responded differently to seasonal temperature regimes, especially to those of April and May (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34909-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), indicating that they might differ in time of seedling establishment in the desert steppe. A study in the Sonoran (hot) Desert reported species‐specific germination timing in which some species readily germinate in the early fall, while others preferentially germinate in winter (Venable, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Although seeds of all our study species had no or shallow dormancy, they are unlikely to germinate immediately after seed dispersal (in autumn). If seeds are nondormant, they may not be able to germinate because it is too dry in the habitat in autumn. If seeds have shallow dormancy, then they undergo dormancy break in winter and/or early spring and germinate in spring or summer. Our results show that seeds of

 <xref rid="ece34909-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a), suggesting they can emerge in early spring. However, this prediction needs to be viewed with caution because the low germination of some species at low temperatures might be due to physiological dormancy that would have been broken by cold stratification during winter, resulting in the ability of seeds to germinate at low spring temperatures (Baskin &amp; Baskin, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Therefore, field seedling emergence in spring may be different from the prediction based on germination responses of species to low temperatures in our study. Nevertheless, our comparison between multiple species at different temperature regimes reveals that species‐specific responses to seasonal temperatures (different responses even in the highest temperature) could be important for the differentiation of germination niche between species in the temperate desert steppe.
