<p class="p">In summary, our study has shown how seed germination of species in the desert steppe community responds to two key environmental factors, that is seasonal temperature and drought stress. Our results suggest that most species are well‚Äêadapted to the desert by the ability to germinate in a habitat characterized by cold and dry conditions. However, they are able to partition their regeneration niche through a heterogeneous set of germination responses to low temperature and drought stress in the early season. Furthermore, seed germination in our desert steppe community is not significantly related to seed size, which may be due to (i) the adaptation of seed germination to the desert conditions regardless of seed size, and/or (ii) the same environmental conditions that seeds experienced during their development. Therefore, our study points to the importance of environmental conditions in shaping seed germination response to desert environments at the community level.</p>
