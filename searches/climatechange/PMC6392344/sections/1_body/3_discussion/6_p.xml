<p class="p">We found great variation in the response of seed germination to environmental conditions both within and between species. As an example of within‚Äêspecies response, seed germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Allium polyrhizum</italic> responded to temperature but remained constant as water potential changed. At the between species response level, seed germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Lagochilus ilicifolium</italic> was extremely sensitive to temperature, but within the same community 
 <italic class="italic">Bassia dasyphylla</italic> had little to no response. This variation would allow germination of different species as well as individuals of the same species to differ in space and time in the desert steppe community. In addition, the variation in seed germination has implications for predicting community change under predicted climate change. For example, the predicted warmer and dryer climates would favor germination of 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia scoparia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Bassia dasyphyl</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Kochia prastrata,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Potentilla tanacetifolia</italic> over that of other species in the community, which would result in altered proportions of germinants of different species and subsequently change community composition of the desert steppe.
