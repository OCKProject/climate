<p class="p">Seed germination is also related to seed traits. One of the most studied regeneration traits is seed mass, which varies considerably among and within species, reflecting the many evolutionary forces acting upon this trait (Leishman, Wright, Moles, Westoby, &amp; Fenner, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Moles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). At the global scale, environments with stable climate are expected to select for and be dominated by taxa that produce relatively large, fast‚Äêgerminating seeds, while relatively small seeds should be adaptive to and predominate in seasonal habitats (Rubio de Casas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Species with small seeds have high temporal variation in germination that spreads the risk of extinction, and large seeds produce large seedlings that perform better than small ones under stressful conditions (Kitajima &amp; Fenner, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Pake &amp; Venable, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Seedlings from large seeds usually can benefit from early emergence by maximizing development of deep root systems and thus defend against aboveground herbivory and climatic stress before the onset of the unfavorable season (Brunner, Herzog, Dawes, Arend, &amp; Sperisen, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In the Amazon region, tree species with small seeds commonly occur in transitional or seasonal forests, and large seeds are generally associated with climatically stable rainforests with high temperatures and precipitation (Malhado et al.,
