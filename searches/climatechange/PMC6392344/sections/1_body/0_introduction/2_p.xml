<p class="p">As the earliest life‚Äêstage transition seed germination is a critical stage in the life history of plants because once seeds germinate seedlings either become established or die. Furthermore, seed germination may increase plant fitness if animals or pathogens attack seeds more than seedlings (Wenny, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Timing of seed germination determines the conditions for subsequent seedling establishment and plant growth and thus is a crucial component of fitness (Donohue, Casas, Burghardt, Kovach, &amp; Willis, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Consequently, germination should be triggered by environmental cues that indicate the onset of conditions favorable for seedling establishment and thereby provide the opportunity for subsequent adaptive divergence to reduce extinction risk (Donohue et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Willis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
