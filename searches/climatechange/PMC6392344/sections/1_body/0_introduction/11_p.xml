<p class="p">With the aim of understanding seed germination strategies at the multi‚Äêspecies scale in the desert environment, we tested the germination response of 20 common species with no or shallow dormancy in a desert steppe to seasonal temperature regimes and drought stress. We hypothesized that responses of seed germination to seasonal temperature and drought stress differ among species at the community level and that germination response is not correlated with seed size due to the adaptation of all species in the stressful environment. Specifically, we asked following questions: (a) How does seasonal temperature affect germination? (b) How does germination respond to drought stress? (c) Is germination related to seed traits?</p>
