<p class="p">Due to low rainfall and high evaporation, low water potential caused by drought stress also affects seed germination in deserts (Alvarado &amp; Bradford, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Volis &amp; Bohrer, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, species vary considerably in response of seed germination to drought stress (Kos &amp; Poschlod, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Large seeds may buffer seedlings from the negative effects of drought (Leishman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), and there is experimental evidence for the advantage of large seed size in establishment of plants under low soil moisture conditions (Leishman &amp; Westoby, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Therefore, seed size is expected to be positively correlated with the ability to germinate under drought stress. Germination only at high water potentials (low drought stress) is predictive of the environment for seedling growth since high water potential indicates a high rainfall event, which ensures that seeds germination and seedlings become established. Thus, low drought tolerance during seed germination (a cautious germination strategy) provides a fitness variance reducing mechanism and is expected to show negative correlations with other variance reducing life‚Äêhistory attributes such as large seed size (Brown &amp; Venable, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>; Kos &amp; Poschlod, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Therefore, knowledge of relationships between germination response to drought stress and seed size is important for understanding the adaptive strategy of plants to desert environments.
