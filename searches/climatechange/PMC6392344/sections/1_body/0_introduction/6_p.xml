<p class="p">Seasonally fluctuating temperatures are an important factor determining germination time of nondormant seeds, and species in different sites show different germination behaviors in response to temperature fluctuation (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For instance, species distributed at high elevations (&gt;2,000Â m) on the Tibetan Plateau did not show a significant germination response to temperature fluctuation, whereas those distributed over a broad elevation (both high and low) had a significant positive response (Liu et al.,

Thus, studying how fluctuating temperature (seasonally or diurnal) affects seed germination of species in different ecosystems can provide valuable information for understanding community structure and biodiversity maintenance.
