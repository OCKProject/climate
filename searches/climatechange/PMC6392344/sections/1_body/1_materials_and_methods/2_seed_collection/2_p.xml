<p class="p">Fresh mature seeds of 20 species were collected in the Siziwang Desert Steppe from August to October in 2016 (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece34909-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> for species list). The Steppe is located in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China (41°47'17" N, 111°53'46" E; 1,450 m a.s.l.). Vegetation in the study area is dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Artemisia frigida</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cleistogenes songorica</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Convolvulus ammannii,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa breviflora</italic>. According to our field survey, there were 38 species in the steppe we studied. The community was mostly homogenous across the steppe. To study seed germination at the community level, we selected 20 common species in this region. These 20 species accounted for about 53% of the species in the community. Based on our preliminary study, we selected the 20 species with no or shallow seed dormancy that germinated to a relatively high percentage, making their germination responses to environmental variation comparable. For each species, seeds were collected at the beginning of their dispersal period from 10 individual plants that were at least 10 m from each other. In the laboratory, the seeds were cleaned by hand and air‐dried for 5 days before they were stored at −20°C for 1–7 months.
