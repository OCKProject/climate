<p class="p">The mass of 1,000 seeds was gravimetrically determined by weighing 10 replicates of 200 large seeds and of 500 small seeds using an electronic balance (1/10,000, Mettler Toledo, Switzerland). Seed size was determined by measuring the length and width of 10 randomly chosen seeds using vernier calipers (Xifeng, China). Seed area was calculated based on seed length and width using the ellipse equation.</p>
