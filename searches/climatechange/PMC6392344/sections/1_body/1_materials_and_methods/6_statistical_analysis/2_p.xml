<p class="p">Germination data were arcsine transformed to ensure homogeneity of variance before performing an ANOVA. Germination data were analyzed by two‐way ANOVA, in which species and temperature regime or PEG concentration were treated as fixed factors. To explore the relationships between mean germination percentages in different conditions (temperature regime and drought stress) and seed traits, standardized major axis regressions were performed. Germination percentages were arcsine‐transformed and seed mass/area log‐transformed before analyses. R package “smatr” (Warton, Duursma, Falster, &amp; Taskinen,
