<p class="p">To test the effect of drought stress on seed germination of each species, polyethylene glycol (PEG) was used to generate osmotic stress (Money, 
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). PEG 6000 (analytical grade) solutions were used in concentrations of 0 (distilled water control), 2.5, 5, 10, and 20% (w/v). Osmotic potentials, calculated using the formula from Money (
 <xref rid="ece34909-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>) for PEG 6000, were 0.0, −0.003, −0.027, −0.155, and −0.87 MPa, respectively. For each water potential, four replicates of 25 seeds per species were used. Seeds were placed in a Petri dish (9‐cm‐diameter) on two layers of filter paper moistened with the appropriate solution and sealed with Parafilm to minimize evaporation. Seeds were incubated in 12 hr of dark and 12 hr of light (as above) at 25°C, and germination was monitored daily for 30 days.
