<p class="p">From meteorological data, we calculated mean monthly minimum and maximum temperatures in the study region. Four temperature regimes representing April, May, June, and July were used: 0 /12°C, 7/19°C, 12/24°C, and 15/27°C, respectively. The temperature regimes for April and May also approximated those in autumn in the steppe. At each temperature regime, seeds were exposed to 12 hr of dark and 12 hr of cool white fluorescent light (about 100 μmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of photosynthetically active radiation) each day. For each temperature regime and species, four Petri dishes of 25 seeds each were used as replicates. Seeds were placed in Petri dishes (9‐cm‐diameter) on two layers of filter paper moistened with 5 ml distilled water, after which they were sealed with Parafilm to minimize evaporation of water. Germination was monitored daily for 30 days. The criterion for germination was radicle protrusion &gt;1 mm. Ungerminated seeds were prodded with forceps to determine whether the embryo was firm, indicating a viable seed (Baskin &amp; Baskin,
