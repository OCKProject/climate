  <p class="p">Correlation between the amount of uncertainty in QQ (total runoff or streamflow) projected under RCP 4.5 and the selected hydrological characteristics of the watersheds: (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Multi-parameter uncertainty and (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) multi-GCM uncertainty. “Uncertainty”: the amount of the multi-parameter or multi-GCM uncertainty, “BFI MEAN”: average annual baseflow index (BFI) values, which represent the fraction of baseflow in streamflow (or total runoff), “1 P Flow”: the 1
   <sup class="sup">st</sup> percentile daily streamflow value, “ELE RANGE”: the difference between elevations of the highest and lowest points within a watershed, “MEAN SLOPE”: the average slope (%) of a watershed.
