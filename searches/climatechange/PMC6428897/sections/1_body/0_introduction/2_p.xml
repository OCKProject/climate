<p id="Par3" class="p">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) launched the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) in the fifth Assessment Report (AR5), whereby a multi-GCM ensemble analysis was facilitated through the provision of climate model outputs that comply with community standards

 </sup>. Multi-GCM ensembles have served as a framework for accommodating probabilistic approaches in interpreting climate predictions and developing climate adaptation plans, and many studies have attempted to quantify uncertainty with the information of ensemble spread and to identify its sources
