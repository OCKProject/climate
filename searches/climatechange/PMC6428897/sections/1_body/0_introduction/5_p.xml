 </sup>. Equifinality is a concept in which there are multiple parameter sets providing equally good or acceptable model outputs. Equifinality is one of the main sources of uncertainty in hydrological modeling, and many methods have been proposed to quantify equifinality and the resulting uncertainty

 </sup>. While it is known that equifinality decreases with increases in the number of observations and decreases in the number of calibration parameters, equifinality is inevitable, and its impact is substantial in hydrological modeling
