<p id="Par35" class="p">The Ohio River basin is located in the Eastern Corn Belt and extends across nine states from Illinois to New York, between the latitudes 36° 07′ and 42° 26′ North, and the longitudes 77° 50′ and 89° 01′ West (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>). Climate varies from a mild temperate or humid subtropical (southwest) to humid continental (northeast) within the basin. The basin drains a primarily agricultural area of 374,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> including several large cities into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico. For this study, 61 study watersheds within the Ohio River basin were selected for the consideration of the drainage areas, geographic locations, climate, availability of streamflow measurements, and applicability of the water balance model, ABCD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>, also refers to a multi-parameter ensemble). The total drainage area of the selected watersheds is 41,341 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, (average size is 678 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), which are equivalent to 11% of the entire Ohio River basin. Daily precipitation and temperature records made at 103 weather stations associated with the basin were used to correct biases in GCM climate projections.
