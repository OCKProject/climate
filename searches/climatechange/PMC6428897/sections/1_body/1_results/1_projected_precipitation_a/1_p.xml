<p id="Par9" class="p">The precipitation and temperature projections made by the 35 GCMs were averaged by the months and by the study watersheds to investigate the overall trends of future climate in the Ohio River basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The annual average precipitation of the Ohio River watersheds was projected to increase by 6.8% and 8.8% from 2020 to 2099 under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively. The projected monthly precipitations showed large seasonal variations, with up to 14% and 19% increases under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1(A,B)</xref>). The increased rates were higher in winter and spring than in summer, which is in agreement with findings reported in the literature
