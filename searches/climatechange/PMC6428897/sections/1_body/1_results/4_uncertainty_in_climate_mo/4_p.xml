<p id="Par22" class="p">The amount of uncertainty in the GCM ensemble projections for the hydrological components and precipitation were highly correlated to each other (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). For example, the amount of uncertainty in the precipitation ensemble was related to those of the QQ, DR, GW, and WA projections with correlation coefficients greater than 0.75. Such a finding indicates that uncertainty in the precipitation ensemble was transferred to the hydrological simulation and suggests that a more considerable effort needs to be invested in improving the projection accuracy of precipitation than temperature in a hydrological analysis of climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). PET was moderately correlated with maximum air temperature (TMX), minimum air temperature (TMN), and TAV, and this reflects the characteristics of the Hargreaves equation that was used for the PET calculation of this study.
