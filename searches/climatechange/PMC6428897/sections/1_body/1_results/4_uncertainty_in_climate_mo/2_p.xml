<p id="Par20" class="p">As the threshold values for the identification of behavioral parameter sets increased from 90.0% (a relatively conservative threshold for equifinality quantification) to 97.5% (a relatively liberal threshold), uncertainty in the GCM ensembles and its relative size to the uncertainty in the parameter ensembles increased exponentially (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In the case of SS, parameter selection was more critical than GCM selection in all of the threshold cases. When relatively loose thresholds (i.e. 90.0% and 92.5%) were used, the selection of the hydrological model parameters became more significant than the GCM selection for the GW and PET projections, implying that the selection of hydrological model parameters needs to be more careful than that of GCMs when soil moisture and groundwater are the concerns of a climate change impact study. Since ET is determined as a direct function of precipitation and direct runoff in the ABCD model, the corresponding uncertainty in the ET projection would become as significant as the uncertainty in the QQ projections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Depending on the thresholds, the GCM selection was 1.5 to 2 times more influential than the parameter selection with respect to an assessment of the climate change impacts on the amount of available water in the watersheds.
