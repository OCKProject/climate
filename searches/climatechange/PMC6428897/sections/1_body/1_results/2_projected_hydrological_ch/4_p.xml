<p id="Par15" class="p">The monthly projections of the multi-parameter and multi-GCM ensembles regarding the hydrological components were compared with the historical data to attain an understanding of the overall projected seasonal changes of the Ohio River watersheds’ hydrology (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). QQ, DR, GW, and ET were predicted to increase in all months, but SS was anticipated to decrease in most of the months, with the exception of January and February (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). WA of the watersheds was expected to decrease in June and July under the RCP 4.5 scenario, and in June, July, October, and November under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The rates of projected QQ and DR increases were larger than those of PP for all months, indicating that the amplified climate change impact on QQ is mainly attributed to the increases of DR (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The projected increase of the ET was relatively large in winter and spring, which corresponds to the temperature projection. The increased ET caused a decrease in SS, with the exception of January and February in which a small amount of ET was shown, implying an agricultural drought would be deepened in the watersheds.
