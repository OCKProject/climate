<p id="Par30" class="p">Although the literature review, parameter calibration, and watershed screening ensured the applicability of the model to the study watersheds, still there must be uncertainty and errors in the modelling results due to the conceptual nature of the model, the lack of observations showing detailed hydrological partitioning processes, and the limitations of the calibration and uncertainty analysis methods. For instance, the lumped representation of the watershed processes may not effectively regulate parameter values in the calibration. The use of a spatially distributed and/or process-based approach can improve the identifiability of calibration parameters and then reduce output uncertainty caused by parameter equifinality

 </sup>. Even when a hydrological model that employs more spatially explicit and sophisticated simulation mechanism is used, observations that can identify the partitioning of internal hydrological components such as direct runoff, soil water content, and groundwater recharge (rather than streamflow) would be necessary to constrain calibration parameters. The additional model complexity that is not supported by such ground truth can further increase output uncertainty. Studies have demonstrated that there is no clear and simple relationship between model complexity and output uncertainty, which must be attributed to the unique structures of models used, the availability of observations for parameter calibration, and the landscape characteristics of a study area of interest
