<p id="Par33" class="p">In this study, the behavioral parameter sets were selected by comparing runoff observed and simulated using a rainfall-runoff model (i.e. ABCD), which is part of hydrological model parameter calibration. Then, the calibrated or behavioral models are considered capable of representing the runoff generation mechanisms of study watersheds, which may not change easily even for a long time. In the study, changes in land uses (e.g. urbanization and deforestation) and topography (by erosion and sediment transport) are assumed not to be significantly large enough to alter the runoff generation mechanism in the study period. Changes in climate may alter the mechanism, but they are also assumed insignificant so that the calibrated parameter values and behavioral models can be valid for hydrological analysis of future climate change in this study.</p>
