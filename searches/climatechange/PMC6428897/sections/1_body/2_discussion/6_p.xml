<p id="Par29" class="p">ABCD is a spatially lumped, continuous monthly hydrological model. In the model, the water balance partitioning of a watershed is defined by nonlinear mathematical relationships between hydrological components. The model representation of the partitioning was calibrated to streamflow measurements made at the watershed outlets in this study. Out of 156 watersheds that have streamflow measurements in the Ohio basin, in addition, only 61 watersheds where the ABCD model provided the minimum model performance statistics of NSE of 0.67 were included in the analysis. The ABCD model has been shown to be capable of re-enacting covariance structure found in between observed PP, PET, and QQ in validating the applicability of the model to watersheds in the U.S.

 </sup>). In the studies, the NSE value of 0.50, 0.65, or 0.67 was reported or suggested as a lower limit of valid goodness-of-fits commonly used in hydrological modeling. We selected the NSE value of 0.67 close to the lower limits (for ‘acceptable’ performance rating) reported in the studies.
