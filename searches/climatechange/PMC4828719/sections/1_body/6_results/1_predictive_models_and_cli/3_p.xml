<p class="p">Data on 
 <italic class="italic">A. flavus</italic>-wheat interactions and predictive models were not available from the literature. Therefore, AFLA-wheat, a modified version of the AFLA-maize model, was developed and run using the same meteorological input data as with the AFLA-maize model (See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">supplementary material</xref> for details). An AFI threshold for high probability of wheat contamination was not available, due to the lack of data on grain contamination. Therefore, an AFI ≥ 38 was considered to coincide with the legal limit for aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> in wheat of 2 μg of aflatoxin per kg of raw grains (Commission Regulation 1881/ 2006 and amendments).
