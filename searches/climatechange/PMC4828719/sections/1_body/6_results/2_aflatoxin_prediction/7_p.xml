<p class="p">Based on this modelling approach to predict future aflatoxin contamination in maize grown in Europe, the +2 °C climate change scenario
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>, currently considered the most reliable for the next 100 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>, resulted into a significant increase in the estimated aflatoxin contamination in all maize growing areas, whereas the predicted impact on contamination in wheat was negligible.
