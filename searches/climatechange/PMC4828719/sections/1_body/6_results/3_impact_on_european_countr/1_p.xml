<p class="p">In the current climatic conditions, European countries in which maize cultivation is common, i.e. in Romania, France, Hungary and north-east Italy (in total accounting for 60% of the total production in 2013 for the 28 EU Member States, FAOStat, 2013), show a low probability of aflatoxin occurrence. An increase from a low to a medium probability of aflatoxin contamination is found under the +2 °C scenario. Critical and high AFI are predicted in some areas of southern European countries (i.e. in Greece, southern Italy, Bulgaria and Albania), in which maize production is marginal, but important for the local population. The +5 °C scenario leads to a larger European domain exposed to aflatoxin contamination. However, despite these figures, an increase in AFI in southern Europe is of limited concern since conditions are less suitable for
