 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>.The expected impact of climate change on the presence of mycotoxins in food and feed is of great concern. These fungal metabolites are important causes of chronic toxicity from exposure via food
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>; in particular, aflatoxins, which have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Hence, the maximal concentration of aflatoxins in agricultural food and feed products and their commodities is regulated worldwide, with specific restrictions in Europe (Commission Regulation EU/574/2011, 2006/1881/EC and amendments). The possible change in patterns of aflatoxin occurrence in food and feed crops due to climate change is a matter of concern that may require anticipatory actions.
