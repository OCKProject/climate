 <italic class="italic">Aspergillus flavus</italic>, the key fungus for aflatoxin production, is well adapted to warm and dry weather conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. Crops from tropical and/or sub-tropical areas are affected more frequently and severely by aflatoxin contamination, but temperate areas could be of increasing importance due to climate change. Exploring scenarios for this emerging hazard in temperate areas in order to predict future trends and anticipate potential control options is, therefore, crucial. To face this challenge, a modelling approach was considered in this study.
