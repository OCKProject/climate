<p class="p">Climate change data are generated on a daily scale; therefore, the model AFLA-maize was adapted accordingly. A new logistic regression was developed to associate AFI, based on daily climate data, to aflatoxin contamination in the field, using the same six-year data as previously mentioned, and AFI &gt; 95 was the resulting threshold value associated to the 50% probability of contamination above 5 μg of aflatoxin per kg of kernels.</p>
