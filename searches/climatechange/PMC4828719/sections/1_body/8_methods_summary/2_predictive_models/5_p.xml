<p class="p">A modified version of AFLA-maize, called AFLA-wheat, was used for predictions in wheat. Starting point of simulation in the crop phenology module was 1 January, and temperature requirements related to DD needed to reach the cropping stages, like flowering and harvest time were defined. In this case, with very limited field data on aflatoxin contamination in wheat, no probability of overcoming the threshold could be associated to the AFI value obtained. Therefore, comparing the legal limit for aflatoxin B
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> in maize and wheat (5 
 <italic class="italic">versus</italic> 2 μg of aflatoxin per kg of kernels), AFI &gt; 38 was arbitrary associated to the 50% probability of contamination above the threshold.
