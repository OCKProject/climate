<p class="p">Aflatoxins are reported in several agricultural crops, mainly maize, peanuts, pistachio nuts and cottonseeds
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Maize contamination is of very high concern since this crop plays a main role both in food and feed supply worldwide. Until a few years ago, aflatoxins have not been signalled as a matter of concern for primary production in Europe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. However, the years 2003 and 2012 must be mentioned, for Italy and South Europe, respectively, because of the alarming contamination in maize
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. Very low aflatoxin contamination was reported in the few studies published on wheat
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, suggesting that, so far, aflatoxins are of minor concern in this crop and its derived products.
