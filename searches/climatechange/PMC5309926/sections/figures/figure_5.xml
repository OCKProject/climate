  <title class="title">The proportions (normalized) of two individual copepod taxa north of three isotherms and their abundances in the twelve 5-year periods.</title>
  <p class="p">
   <italic class="italic">Euchaeta acuta</italic> on the top row did not exhibit evidence of niche plasticity in relation to thermal change;

   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Proportions (normalized) of the populations of the two species north of isotherms at 11, 12 and 13 °C in the twelve 5-year periods from 1954–1958 to 2009–2013. The isotherms move north as the SST rises; 
   <italic class="italic">Euchaeta acuta</italic> exhibits no correlation (at 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05) between the normalized population percentages north of each isotherm and the mean latitude of the isotherms; 
   <italic class="italic">Metridia lucens</italic> exhibits a significant negative correlation. A loess smoother was used for locally weighted polynomial regression, the grey area indicating the 95% confidence interval for the line. The 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> values are listed in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1b</xref>. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Abundance: the mean of the values derived by kriging at each (longitude, latitude) for each 5-year period.
