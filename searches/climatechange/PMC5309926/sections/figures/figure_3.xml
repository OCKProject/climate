  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a–f</bold>) Maps of the totals of the log-transformed (log(
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>+1)) cell counts determined by ordinary kriging for all diatom and dinoflagellate taxa. The maps were independently scaled 0.0–1.0 to highlight population movements. The movement of the dinoflagellates south in the period of cooling and then north in the period of warming exceeds the corresponding movement of the diatoms.
