  <p class="p">Proportions (normalized) of the (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) diatom and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) dinoflagellate populations north of the three isotherms within the geographic area 45–64° N, 20° W–8° E in the twelve 5-year periods from 1954–1958 to 2009–2013. The isotherms move north as the SST rises; these plots illustrate negative correlations (at 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.05) between the normalized population percentages north of each isotherm and the mean latitude of the isotherms. A loess smoother was used for locally weighted polynomial regression, the grey area indicating the 95% confidence interval for the line. The 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic> values are listed in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>.
