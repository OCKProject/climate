<p class="p">Species distribution models that predict impacts of climate change on species' ranges generally assume that each species has a fixed environmental niche, referred to here as ‘niche conservatism', including an optimal temperature range so that each species' distribution and/or phenology will be determined by environmental conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Certainly there is strong evidence that environmental conditions are an important driver of marine plankton distribution

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. However, this assumption of environmental niche conservatism may be overly simplistic with palaeoecological and other studies indicating that species may be much more resilient to climate change than predicted by models assuming a fixed environmental niche

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Such resilience to climate change, referred to here as ‘niche plasticity', may be due to a range of biotic and abiotic factors including (a) evolutionary adaptation, (b) genetic variation across the range of a taxon, (c) phenotypic plasticity, (d) interaction with other taxa including competitors, parasites, prey and predators, each of which will exhibit their own responses to changing conditions or (e) phenological changes. Whether such niche plasticity is actually occurring in free-living populations remains equivocal, leading some authors to stress the need for more comprehensive estimates of climate change impacts especially on plankton

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> due to their particular importance: their responses to climate change may have profound ecosystem consequences as they form an integral component of marine food chains and phytoplankton are responsible for nearly 50% of global photosynthesis
