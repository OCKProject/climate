 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figs 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">6</xref>, which plot and map the responses of two copepod taxa, 
 <italic class="italic">E. acuta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">M. lucens</italic>. The former does not display niche plasticity: there was no correlation between proportion north of the isotherms and the latitude of the isotherm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1a</xref>), meaning that the geographic range of the species moves with the isotherm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Fig. 6a–c</xref>): the species moved south 5 km in the period of cooling and then north 181 km in the period of warming (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1b</xref>). The species displays no correlation between abundance and SST (
