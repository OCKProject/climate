<p class="p">Despite this, both groups exhibited major range changes over recent decades: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> maps the two groups in the 5-year periods at the start of the cooling period (1959–1963), the transition from cooling to warming (1984–1988) and the end of the warming period (2004–2008). During the period of cooling the median latitude of the diatoms moved south 84 km before moving north 92 km during the period of warming; the median latitude of the dinoflagellates moved south 111 km then north 135 km in the same periods. These range changes were smaller than the movement of the isotherms, that is, the velocity of climate change (
