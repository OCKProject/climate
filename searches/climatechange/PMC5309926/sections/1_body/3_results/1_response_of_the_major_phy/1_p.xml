<p class="p">The six decades used here include periods of consistent ocean cooling (1959–1984) and warming (1984–2008) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>), all three moving south in the period of cooling and then moving north in the period of warming. We found that diatoms and dinoflagellates, major phytoplankton groups, both broadly exhibited evidence for a plastic environmental niche: 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> illustrates the relationship between the percentage of each group north of each of the three isotherms and the latitude of those isotherms in the twelve 5-year periods 1954–2013. In all cases there was a significant negative correlation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1a</xref>): as the isotherms moved north the proportion of each group north of each isotherm fell and vice versa.
