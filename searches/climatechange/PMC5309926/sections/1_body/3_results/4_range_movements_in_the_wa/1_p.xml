<p class="p">The taxa examined here exhibiting niche conservatism (from all groups) showed a mean northward range shift in the warming period of 99 km per decade, contrasting with a 7 km per decade shift for those taxa exhibiting niche plasticity at all three isotherms (derived from 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1a,b</xref>). The mean poleward movement in the warming period for all taxa analysed here was 54 km per decade while the mean latitude shifts for the isotherms at 11, 12 and 13 °C in the same period were 151, 126 and 104 km per decade, respectively. In the period of warming in the geographic area used here we found differences of up to 900 km in the movement of the median range latitude of individual taxa: the diatom

While these two species exhibited the largest southerly and northerly range shifts of the taxa investigated here they are not extreme outliers: three taxa exhibited southerly movement of more than 100 km and 18 taxa exhibited a northerly movement of greater than 100 km in that period (
