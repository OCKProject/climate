<p class="p">Two of the possible explanations for the lack of range shifts found here among some taxa, particularly the diatoms, are (i) phenological changes, whereby taxa adjust their seasonal timing of maximum abundance so that they continue to experience the same thermal regime even when sea temperatures are warming or cooling, and (ii) the relative positions of the taxon ranges and the latitudes of the isotherms used, whereby the extent of range movement depends on whether the range centre or range limits for a taxon are considered. To consider these possible explanations, we examined phenological shifts and the positions of the taxon ranges with respect to the isotherm latitudes over the period of warming and the six decades respectively. During the recent warming (1984–2008), there was no link between the extent of range movement for individual taxa and their shift in phenology (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>), that is, taxa that showed a limited northerly range shift in the recent warming era did not have a stronger tendency to shift their phenological timing of abundance to earlier in the year. Note however that generally across taxa, regardless of their range change, there was a tendency for a phenological shift to earlier in the year. The extent of range movement across taxa seemed unrelated to whether isotherms were examined at the range centre or range limits. First, for example, we found similar patterns of range movement with respect to different isotherms that occurred in different parts of the range of each taxon. Second, the extent of range movement seemed unrelated to whether taxa occurred largely to the south of the isotherms considered (for example, the copepod

 <italic class="italic">Calanus finmarchicus</italic> and the diatom 
 <italic class="italic">Skeletonema costatum</italic>) or straddled the isotherms (the majority of taxa) (
