<p class="p">In contrast to the diatoms, only 4 of the 12 dinoflagellate taxa (
 <italic class="italic">Ceratium fusus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">C. minutum</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Dinophysis spp.</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Protoperidinium spp.</italic>) exhibited environmental niche plasticity at all three isotherms examined (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1a</xref>). Of the dinoflagellate taxa which exhibited niche plasticity to SST at any isotherm, all exhibited negative correlations between population size and mean SST (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1c</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2a</xref>) with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">Ceratium minutum</italic> which has a very low population size over the six decades examined here (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1d</xref>), resulting in a major decline in the abundance of dinoflagellates in the NE Atlantic region in the recent warming period, as has been noted previously in a shorter time-series
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. The general observation is that dinoflagellates either showed no niche plasticity to SST changes or showed plasticity accompanied by falling populations and/or very low populations.
