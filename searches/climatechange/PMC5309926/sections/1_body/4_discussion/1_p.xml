<p class="p">Profound temperature changes have been widely reported in the oceans, including the cooling and warming periods in the NE Atlantic and the cooling since 2008, which may be due to a reduction in the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, melting of the Greenland ice sheet and/or solar variability, although the causes are not clear and are debated by various authors

Using the periods of cooling and warming, the observation that the major phytoplankton groups and indeed the majority of individual taxa that moved north in periods of warming exhibited the opposite response in periods of cooling over six decades reduces the possibility of a driver other than thermal change. This conclusion is consistent with broad evidence for the role of temperature in determining plankton species ranges
