<p class="p">The observation that most of the taxa reported here exhibited movement in the direction of the climate velocity, including many of the taxa exhibiting niche plasticity, is consistent with the predictions of Parmesan

Our observations also support the conclusions from a recent examination of a 15-year plankton time-series at a fixed site in the Caribbean which suggested that some planktonic taxa can to adapt to changing temperatures by changing their environmental niche
