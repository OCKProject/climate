<p class="p">Within the complexity of variable range changes across taxa it was, however, clearly evident that diatoms showed a greater tendency for niche plasticity compared with the dinoflagellates. While the causes for this dichotomy are unknown it is noteworthy that this finding appears to support the change in relative abundance of diatoms to dinoflagellates in recent decades in the North Atlantic

In this case niche plasticity has been linked to increased relative abundance, reiterating the major differences across taxa in their responses to long-term environmental change.
