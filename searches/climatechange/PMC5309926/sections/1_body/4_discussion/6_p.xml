 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>). These range changes remain among the most extreme reported across terrestrial and aquatic systems, but it should be noted that these extreme poleward shifts do not reflect the movement of all taxa, many taxa moved far smaller distances despite major environmental changes across several decades. Our evidence for marked differences in the extent of niche plasticity versus conservatism across taxa points to a major spatial reorganization of plankton communities, rather than existing communities simply moving northwards collectively as ocean temperatures warm. This reorganization will presumably have major implications for grazing pressures on phytoplankton thereby impacting higher trophic levels, including fisheries
