<p class="p">There are several possible explanations for the complex differences in plankton range movements reported here. First, genetic adaptation or genetic variation within one taxon across its range. Different taxa may show different levels of evolutionary change over these timescales or genetic differences over these geographic areas. While experimental manipulations have shown the ability of the coccolithophore 
 <italic class="italic">Emiliania huxleyi</italic> to evolve over time-scales of a year
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, with changes to the dominant genotype after exposure to changing temperature or pH, for this species one year represents many hundreds of generations. For larger metazoan taxa such as copepods which may have only a few generations per year, evolutionary change may not be as evident over a few decades compared with phytoplankton where generation times are much shorter. Second, phenotypic plasticity. Our observation that some taxa show minimal range changes in the face of rising ocean temperatures may reflect their phenotypic plasticity, also sometimes referred to as phenotypic buffering
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Such phenotypic plasticity is well known in terms of photoacclimation whereby individual phytoplankton cells can respond to a changing light environment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> but might equally occur with respect to changing temperature. Third, biotic interactions. While a taxon may be physiologically able to tolerate the abiotic conditions in a region, population of that region may not be viable because of the presence or absence of predators, prey, parasites or competitors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, each of which will themselves have different sensitivity and response to the biotic and abiotic changes. The chaotic nature of these interactions and their sensitivity to initial conditions make prediction of outcomes very difficult
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Fourth, phenological change. Taxa may show phenological responses to warming, changing their seasonal timing of maximal abundance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. In this way it is possible that when sea temperatures change species might remain in the same location, shifting their phenology rather than their range. Our analysis, however, suggests that the lack of movement north for the diatoms cannot be explained by a shift in the timing of the seasonal peak of abundance because this group did not exhibit any correlation between phenological shift and range movement, indeed none of the groups did. Last, analytic considerations. The apparent range movement or otherwise we found could have been an artifact of the latitude of the isotherms used in relation to the taxon ranges. Our analysis does not support this suggestion since the isotherms chosen straddle the centre of the geographic area sampled and generally straddle the range centres and limits of the taxa analysed, especially the diatoms and dinoflagellates.
