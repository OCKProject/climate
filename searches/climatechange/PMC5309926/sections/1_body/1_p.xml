One method of examining responses of free-living plankton populations to environmental change is by assessing their range changes with respect to isotherm movement through time. Assessing the proportions of a plankton population north and south of individual isotherms is an approach to look for objective evidence for or against a fixed environmental niche: if a taxon is exhibiting niche plasticity in response to ocean warming then its range change should be less than the movement of its starting thermal niche and hence the proportion of the species polewards of each given isotherm should fall. We used data from the CPR
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> (Continuous Plankton Recorder) survey, one of the most extensive biological time-series in existence, to map the distribution of 35 of the best sampled taxa of diatoms, dinoflagellates and copepods in the NE Atlantic and North Sea over six decades from 1954 to 2013. We assessed how plankton range changes compared to the velocity of climate change, that is, the rate at which isotherms have moved polewards, and hence we establish both the extent of variability across taxa in their range changes as well as whether taxa are showing environmental niche conservatism or plasticity.
