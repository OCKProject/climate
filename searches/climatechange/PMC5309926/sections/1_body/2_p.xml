<p class="p">While the range of some taxa closely tracked the velocity of climate change (that is, the rate of isotherm movement across years), for other taxa their range moved much more slowly, suggesting that their environmental niche has changed. These contrasting patterns of niche conservatism versus niche plasticity respectively varied across groups: dinoflagellates and copepods tended to show niche conservatism while diatoms tended to show niche plasticity, resulting in considerable differences in range shifts between taxa. This result contrasts with recent modelling and has major implications for the biological assemblage and hence the marine ecosystem and fisheries.</p>
