 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref> and is summarized here. The CPR machines are towed behind volunteer commercial shipping vessels at ∼6–7 m depth. Plankton are filtered by a slowly scrolling mesh (size 270 μm) and sandwiched by a second mesh before being rolled up in 4% formaldehyde. Although some phytoplankton may escape this mesh size, the proportions of these taxa captured are consistent and comparable between samples, the SAHFOS methods of analysis of these samples have remained consistent since 1958. Data are not collected &lt;10 km from any coast to avoid interference from local conditions. We use data from the most consistently sampled areas of the survey.
