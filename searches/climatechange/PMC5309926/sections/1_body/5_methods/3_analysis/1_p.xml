<p class="p">The data collated by SAHFOS include latitude, longitude, date, time and abundance. Monthly data were estimated for each 5-year period (1954–1958 January, 1954–1958 February to 2009–2013 December) using ordinary kriging to produce abundance maps for the geographic area 45–64° N, 20° W–8° E. Geostatistical methods such as kriging assume stable spatial structures over the sampling period

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref> of 5-yearly monthly intervals. The ordinary kriging was applied to these data sets to estimate abundances for each 0.5 × 0.5° geographic location and the means of these geographic location estimates for each month were then used to produce 5-yearly maps of the distribution and abundance of each taxon. These 5-yearly data sets were used for all subsequent analysis with the exception of the phenological analysis and to produce all the tables and figures with the exception of
