<p class="p">Monthly mean SST values were obtained from the HADISST data. These are on a 1 × 1° grid. As with the CPR data, we divided the SST data into 5-year monthly intervals and used ordinary kriging on these data sets to estimate SST values for each 0.5 × 0.5° geographic location. Using these estimates, polynomial regression was used to find the latitude of isotherms at 11, 12 and 13 °C at each 0.5° longitude in each period, these isotherms chosen to straddle the centre of the geographic area and taxon ranges sampled (
