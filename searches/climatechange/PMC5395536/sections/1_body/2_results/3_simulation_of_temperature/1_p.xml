<p class="p">According to 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, the LARS-WG model has a reasonable capability of simulating the minimum and maximum temperatures. In the present study temperatures, more than 26 °C (threshold temperature) were simulated for the future decades by LARS-WG model. The comparison between the observed decade and the future decades shows the frequency of days with max temperatures higher than 26 °C will be a significant increase for the next five decades (especially in 2089–2080 and 2099–2090) (
