<p class="p">By increasing the temperature in the future, decade’s mortality will also increase. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, temperature, frequency (days) and number of mortality are shown for the observed period (a) and the future decades (b to f). In the observed period, max temperature was 43 °C, maximum frequency was recorded in 34 °C, and maximum mortality is seen at this temperature. For the future decades, in addition to the temperature increase the frequency of temperatures more than 26 °C (threshold temperature) has also increased which made the increase of mortality. Maximum increases will be seen for 2080–2090 such that the maximum estimation is 47 °C (e) which leads to the highest rate of mortality.
