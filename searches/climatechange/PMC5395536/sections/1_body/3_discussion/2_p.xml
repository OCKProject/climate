<p class="p">Among men, CVD mortality increases rapidly after age of 30 yr and reaches to the highest mortality at the age of 71. In the age groups above 71, mortality among women increased significantly compared to men. Therefore, there are sex-related differences in cardiovascular disease mortality. This difference has been largely attributed to circulating estrogens present in women of fertile age. This explanation can be supported by epidemiological data that early menopause occurring spontaneously or as a result of bilateral oophorectomy is associated with 4â€“7 fold elevation in the risk of CVD (
