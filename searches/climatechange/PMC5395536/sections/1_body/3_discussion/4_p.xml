<p class="p">According to 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">4</xref>, the number of days with temperatures above the threshold in the coming decades compared to the observed decade increases. In addition, in the observed period, the highest frequency is related to 34 °C. In the 2021–2030 decade, the highest frequency is related to the same temperature, but in the 2046–2055 and 2056–2065 periods also known as the “middle-future” periods, the highest temperature is related to 36 °C (as 2 °C increase). The prediction of the highest frequency is based on the 2080–2089 and 2090–2099 decades as future periods, the temperature will be 38 °C. Furthermore, the highest estimated temperature in the future decades compared to the observed period indicates 5 °C increase, which can be an important issue from the perspective of human beings’ health.
