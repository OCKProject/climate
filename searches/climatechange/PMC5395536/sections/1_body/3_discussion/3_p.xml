<p class="p">In this paper, we investigated the association between air temperature (maximum and minimum) and cardiovascular disease mortality in Mashhad, Iran, during the years 2004–2013. The influence of the temperature (both minimum and maximum) on mortality was confirmed. This relationship in many regions of the world is proven (

While this relationship, was negative and weak but significant for minimum temperature. In this way, maximum temperature was used for detailed review. The most researchers conducted in relation with the effect of thermal parameters on cardiovascular disease mortality have significantly emphasized this relationship. This is while this relationship sometimes has been in reverse direction regarding the rate of mortality due to other diseases such as respiratory diseases. For example, with the increase in the temperature, the rate of mortality reduces, and with the decrease in the temperature, it rises (
