For example, the change in all natural mortality associated with 1 °C increase in maximum temperature above the city-specific threshold was 3.12% (95% credibility interval = 0.60% to 5.72%) in the Mediterranean region and 1.84% (0.06% to 3.64%) in the north-continental region. Evaluating the association between ambient air temperature and specific health outcomes can help in identifying vulnerable populations and formulating preventive actions (
