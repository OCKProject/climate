<p class="p">According to the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report, climate change is likely to affect human health directly through changes in temperature and precipitation and indirectly through changes in the ranges of disease vectors (e.g., mosquitoes) and other channels (

Not only has the global average temperature increased, but the frequency and intensity of extreme temperatures (e.g., heat waves and cold spells) have, also, the projected changes in surface air temperature in West Asia range between 1.26 and 6.3 °C over the period 2010–2099 (with respect to the baseline period (1961–1990) for the B1 and A1F1 scenarios (
