<p class="p">The heat-related mortality were estimated in the UK in the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). The present-day relationship between daily mean temperature and mortality rates will apply in the future, and have applied an ensemble of climate models working from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B emissions scenario. Using the same method (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>) investigated future heat-related mortality impacts in six cities (Boston, Budapest, Dallas, Lisbon, London and Sydney), they showed that higher mortality is attributed to increases in the mean and variability of temperature with climate change rather than with the change in mean temperature alone. Besides, Heatwave considered under three different climate change scenarios for 2081â€“2100 and in the absence of adaptation (

Their results showed city of Chicago, Illinois could experience between 166 and 2217 excess deaths per year attributable to heat waves, based on estimates from 7 global climate models. Regional adaptation planning is unfortunately often limited by the lack of quantitative information on potential future health responses. Studies in this field are limited in Iran and a lot of them have been conducted outside Iran. In addition, the relationship between climatic parameters and the mortality rate has been considered, while the issue of the climate change and its effects on the mortality rate has received less attention. Regarding the issue, that Mashhad city is one of the most populated cities in Iran and has very different climatic conditions in different seasons of a year, and like other cities in the word, it has been influenced by conditions of climate changes in the future.
