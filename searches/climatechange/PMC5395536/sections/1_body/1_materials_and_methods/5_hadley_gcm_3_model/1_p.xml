<p class="p">In this study, the output from the Hadley GCM 3 model (HadCM3) was utilized. It uses a 360 d per year and has a spatial grid with dimensions 2.5° latitude × 3.75° longitude. This GCM contains a complex model of land surface processes. It is considered the most mature and popular of the GCMs. This GCM is unique, in which it does not require flux adjustments to produce a realistic scenario (
