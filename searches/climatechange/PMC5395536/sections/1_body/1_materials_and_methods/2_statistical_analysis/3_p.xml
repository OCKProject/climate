<p class="p">Where x is the independent variable (max temperature) and y is the dependent variable (mortality). In the following, by using LARS-WG model, data of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) (in this study, HadCM3), under emission scenarios (in this study, A2) confirmed by IPCC were downscaled and the data of max and min temperatures were simulated for the future decades (2021–2030, 2046–2055, 2056–2065, 2080–2089, 2090–2099). Finally, by using the Linear Regression Model cardiovascular mortality were simulated.</p>
