<p class="p">Temperature plays a critical role in mother-tuber rotting; it has been demonstrated that 
 <italic class="italic">Pectobacterium</italic> spp. grow better and are more pathogenic at lower temperatures (&lt;25°C) compared to

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Temperature has been found to determine species presence and the expression of pathogenicity factors [

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], with numerous studies demonstrating the effect of temperature on species selection [

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. If more than one species is present inside a rotting mother tuber, it has been shown that temperature modulates which pathogen will predominate [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. A species exposed to its optimal temperature range will therefore have the advantage of maximum growth rate allowing it to reach critical numbers ahead of other competing species, both within-individual and between-individual mother tubers in the field [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Another important environmental factor for mother-tuber rotting is soil water level. Presence of a water film on the tuber surface induces development of anaerobic conditions in the mother tubers, thereby favoring bacterial multiplication and initiation of rotting [
