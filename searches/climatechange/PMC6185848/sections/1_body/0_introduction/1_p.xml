<p class="p">Potato blackleg and soft rot, caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Pectobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dickeya</italic> species, are among the most significant bacterial diseases affecting potato production globally [

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In Great Britain (GB), these diseases are caused predominantly by

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Blackleg and soft rot are longstanding problems in GB, as in many other potato growing regions of Europe and elsewhere, and although incidence has been significantly reduced since the 1960s, thanks largely to improvements in storage and seed certification, recent years have seen a marked upward trend in incidence in seed potato crops [

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. There has also been an increase in blackleg and soft rot incidence in continental Europe over the last ten years, corresponding with an increase in the number of causative organisms including

 <italic class="italic">carotovorum</italic> subsp.

 <italic class="italic">solani</italic> (Dsol) [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Since it was first isolated in Europe in 2004, Dsol has spread rapidly across the continent and was, until recently, the predominant pathogen responsible for blackleg and soft rot incidences [
