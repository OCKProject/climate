 <italic class="italic">Pectobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dickeya</italic> species cannot survive in the soil between potato crops in a crop rotation system in GB, and it is generally accepted that the major source of field inoculum is the latently infected seed (mother) tubers [

 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. When the ‘mother’ tuber rots, the bacteria are released into the soil and are transmitted by soil water to contaminate neighboring progeny tubers. Czajkowski et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] showed that the bacteria in soil can also colonize potato roots and subsequently move via the vascular system into progeny tubers. When progeny tubers are infected, field symptoms include reduced emergence, wilting, chlorosis, tuber and stem rot, blackleg, haulm (stalk) desiccation and plant death [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. If environmental conditions are not suitable for disease development the bacteria can survive in latent form, which can lead to extensive soft rot in tubers in storage. Most importantly, latently infected seed (mother) tubers may form the next generation of seed, resulting in carryover of inoculum to the following field generations.
