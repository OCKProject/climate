<p class="p">For the purposes of a preliminary climate change risk assessment for non-indigenous 
 <italic class="italic">Pectobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dickeya</italic> species in GB, we focus on the effect of temperature on tuber macerating capacity, given the critical role of mother-tuber rotting to the epidemiology of these pathogens. We also evaluate agronomic scenarios for relocation of GB potato production from the semi-arid east to areas of higher rainfall on the west. Our goals were to: (1) quantify the effect of different temperatures on the aggressiveness of Pba, Pbr, Ppa, and Dsol in potato tubers; (2) investigate if the non-indigenous European strains and species (Pbr, Ppa, Dsol) could become stronger competitors in the GB potato ecosystem under future climates, on the basis of their rate of development within (mother) tubers relative to Pba; and (3) compare the effect of temperature regimes in current crop locations and areas of higher rainfall on the relative aggressiveness of Pba, Pbr, Ppa, and Dsol in potato tubers. We used a newly developed empirical model fitted to disease severity data from a controlled environment tuber assay, and a Bayesian modelling framework together with GB potato crop distribution data to project future maceration ability under various CO
