<p class="p">Another finding of interest for the potato industry is the ramifications of climate-change induced shifts in agricultural planting patterns. The influence of temperature (and thus crop location) on aggressiveness in tubers suggests potential for the design of disease suppressive landscapes, where a more strategic approach to the introduction of new potato production areas is adopted. In this study we investigated a shift in GB potato production from the semi-arid east to rain-fed production in the west, and its impact in mitigating future increase in aggressiveness in tubers. This adaptation strategy was most effective in Scotland, as Scotland has the coolest current and projected weather in GB, and least effective in England, which has the warmest temperatures and the most widespread distribution of potato crops. It is likely this adaptation strategy would have been much more effective in general had we used the polygon data defining the spatial coverage of potato crops as opposed to rasterizing the data to a coarse 25 km binary grid (giving less options for crop relocation), or had we accounted for the area of crop within each grid cell and modelled the area affected by disease over time. However, both these options would have been prohibitively computer-intensive given the Bayesian parameter estimation method used in this study, where over 1 million disease severity values were generated for each combination of pathogen, potato grid cell location, month, and CO
