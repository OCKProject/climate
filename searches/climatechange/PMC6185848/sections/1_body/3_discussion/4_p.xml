<p class="p">Our synthesis of crop distribution and probabilistic climate change data, together with the application of Bayesian parameter estimation to a novel model describing the effects temperature on aggressiveness in tubers, enabled the development of a super-ensemble based probabilistic projection approach that accounted systematically for the uncertainties not only from the emission and climate change scenarios, but also from the biophysical processes in the model. This work highlights the importance of spatial context in climate change risk assessments for crop pathogens, as the efficacy of adaptation strategies varied between the constituent countries of GB. We were able to demonstrate the utility of our approach in providing useful information to guide potato industry management practices and government strategies for agricultural adaptation to climate change. Although the aggressiveness of Pba is projected to increase slightly in GB in the future, and results indicate a modest potential for the predominant European

The methodology developed in this study is extendable to other potato blackleg and soft rot pathogens and can be applied using standard GCM output.
