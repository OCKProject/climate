<p class="p">In this study we developed a parsimonious but biologically plausible model to describe the effects of temperature on disease severity (lesion size) of GB and European 
 <italic class="italic">Pectobacterium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dickeya</italic> spp. in potato tubers, using a Bayesian framework and data from controlled environment experiments. This was combined with probabilistic climate change data and potato crop distribution data to project the differential capacity to cause disease in tubers under future climates in GB production areas, and provide a complete characterisation of model uncertainty and uncertainty in predicting climate. A key finding for the GB potato industry is that the greatest future increases in aggressiveness in tubers for Pbr and Dsol, the predominant blackleg (symptoms on stems as opposed to tubers) and soft rot strains in Europe, are projected to occur late in the season in August and September. Our first take-home message to the GB potato industry is that this finding reinforces the need to maintain current best practice for managing potato blackleg in GB: to kill haulm in crops well in advance of harvest and to harvest crops as early as possible [

A second key finding for the GB potato industry is that temperatures during July and August in England and Wales are currently near the optimum for Pba, the predominant blackleg strain in GB. The projected changes to current Pba severity during July and August were therefore small and declined with increasing time and level of CO

Where temperature increases exceed the pathogenâ€™s thermal optimum, we might see the emergence of a bimodal pattern of disease, where Pba severity levels peak both early and late in the season but decrease during the midsummer. The potential for an increase in Pba early in the season could be managed by having pectolytic bacterial levels assessed on seed prior to planting. Although diagnostics are only indicative of levels on tubers at the time of testing, it would still provide an indication of potential disease development. Thus, our second take-home message for the GB potato industry would be to consider increased diagnostic testing on seed prior to planting in the future.
