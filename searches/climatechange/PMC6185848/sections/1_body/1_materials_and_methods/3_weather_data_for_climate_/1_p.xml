<p class="p">Raw monthly 25 km gridded values of mean temperature from the UK Met Office Climate Projections database (UKCP09) 11-member ensemble of spatially coherent climate projections (SCPs) were used to drive the disease severity model. The SCPs provide the best estimates for modelling and summarizing the potential effects of future climates on crop disease epidemics in the UK as they are fully coherent across different locations, allowing the user to consider climate change at more than one location in a way that captures the relationship between the different locations, and to average projections across user defined land areas. They include both internal modelling variability (using perturbed physics ensembles) and external modelling variability (from the use of different General Circulation Models, or GCMs), as well as information on climate variability. The SCPs provide 11 equally plausible snapshots of climate change for a number of different emissions scenarios and time periods and are freely available for download at

Three, thirty-year future time-slices (centred on the 2040s, 2060s, and 2080s) and three climate forcing scenarios (UKCP09 Low, Medium and High CO
