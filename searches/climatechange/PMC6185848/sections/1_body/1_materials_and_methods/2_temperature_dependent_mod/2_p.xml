<p class="p">Tuber slice and experimental replicates were treated as independent (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6 host-pathogen interactions per temperature). The models were fitted separately to the data for Pba, Pbr, Ppa, and Dsol using a Bayesian framework that produces distributions of model parameter values and residual error that provide a complete characterization of model uncertainty that can be seamlessly propagated through to the climate change risk assessment. We used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods via Gibbs sampling with the software WinBUGS 1.4. The basic idea of the MCMC method, and in particular of the Gibbs sampling algorithm, is that the program steps through the unknown parameters one at a time, estimating the posterior distribution of each parameter conditional on the current values of all the other parameters, and then sampling a random value from the posterior distribution. This procedure can be shown to converge eventually on the posterior distributions of the parameters. In the current study, diffuse uniform prior distributions (from 0 to 100) were used for all parameters, and the residual variance was assigned a weakly informative uniform prior (from 0.01 to 100) [

 <sup class="sup">th</sup> value, so that the resultant posterior distributions contained 1000 values each. In other words, for each of the four lesion (pathogen) datasets, we obtained 1000 vectors of fitted parameter values and associated residual variance. We assessed model convergence (on the same posterior distributions) using the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin diagnostic [
 <xref rid="pone.0205711.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. A value close to 1 indicates convergence of parallel chains: the diagnostic was &lt; 1.1 for all model parameters for the Pba, Pbr, Ppa, and Dsol datasets.
