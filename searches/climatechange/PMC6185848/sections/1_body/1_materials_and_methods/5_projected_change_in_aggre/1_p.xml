We investigated the effects of geographic variability in climate on future aggressiveness in tubers by grouping projected values within the three constituent countries of Great Britain (Scotland, England, and Wales). Results for future climates were taken relative to those for baseline conditions and presented as percentage changes to current aggressiveness in tubers using boxplots for each of the four pathogens: i.e., relative change = (severity

 <sub class="sub">current</sub>) / severity
 <sub class="sub">current</sub> × 100. Results are summarized using boxplots (computed from the super-ensemble of projected values) to quantify uncertainty in predicting climate, uncertainty in the model parameter values, and uncertainty due to model residual error. This gave a total of 48 boxplots per CO
