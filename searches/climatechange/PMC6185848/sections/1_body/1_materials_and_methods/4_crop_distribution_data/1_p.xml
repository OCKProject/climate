<p class="p">We initially proceed under the assumption that the current spatial coverage of potato crops provides a reasonable proxy indicator of future coverage (this assumption is later relaxed in the adaptation scenarios). Polygon data defining the spatial coverage of potato crops in 2015 (19,523 crops) were provided by AHDB Potatoes (

The data were rasterized to a 25 km binary grid (containing potato and non-potato) matching the resolution of the climate change data.
