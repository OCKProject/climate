<p class="p">Projected lesion diameters for Pbr, Ppa, and Dsol (the main causative agents in Europe) were also directly compared to the corresponding values for Pba (the GB strain) in order to investigate the potential for widespread establishment of the European strains and species in GB, on the basis of their differential capacity to cause disease in tubers under future climates. All lesion diameters were normalized by the maximum projected Pba lesion diameter, and then displayed using radar plots to visualize the aggressiveness of the European strains and species relative to Pba.</p>
