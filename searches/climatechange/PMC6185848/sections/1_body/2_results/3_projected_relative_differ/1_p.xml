 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario in the 2080s, as the other scenarios produced intermediate results. Pba was able to produce consistently larger lesions under all climate change scenarios, followed by Dsol, Pbr, and Ppa (

However, as projected soil temperatures increased through the climate change scenarios, the difference in aggressiveness between Pba and the non-indigenous European strains and species decreased. This was most evident in England and Wales in July and August.
