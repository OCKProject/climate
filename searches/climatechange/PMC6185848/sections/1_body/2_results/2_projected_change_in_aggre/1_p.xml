<p class="p">Projections suggest that as the weather in the UK changes, the aggressiveness of Pba in tubers will increase (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions scenario in the 2060s, and the high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario in the 2080s, as the other scenarios produced intermediate results. Pba severity increased consistently with time (decades) and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, with smaller increases projected for July and August, as both baseline and projected temperatures were nearer the optimum values for Pba lesion development during the warmer summer months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205711.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). There was limited geographic variability in the response of Pba to climate change: the mean difference in median monthly changes to current Pba severity among the constituent countries of GB was 1.4, 2.4, and 4.4% for the low CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2040s, medium CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2060s, and high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2080s scenarios, respectively.
