Again, this does not imply a competitive advantage, but suggests potential for Ppa to become a higher consequence pathogen in potato crops in GB than present. There was notable geographic variability in the response of Ppa to climate change, with a mean difference in median monthly changes to current Ppa severity among the constituent countries of GB of 6.8, 12.3, and 19.3% for the low CO
