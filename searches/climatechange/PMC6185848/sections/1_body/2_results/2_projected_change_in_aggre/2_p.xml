 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205711.g005" class="xref">Fig 5Dâ€“5F</xref>). This is due to the initial curvilinear or convex portion of the Pbr temperature-response curve; baseline and projected air temperatures for September corresponded to a less steeply ascending portion of the Ppa response curve than August temperatures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205711.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B</xref>). The percentage changes to current Pbr severity were notably higher than those for Pba. This should not be interpreted as implying a competitive advantage over Pba, but rather that temperatures are expected to become relatively (compared to current conditions) more favourable for Pbr development in tubers than Pba. Geographic variability in the response of Pbr to climate change was negligible, with a mean difference in median monthly changes to current Pbr severity among the constituent countries of GB of 2.3, 4.3, and 6.3% for the low CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2060s, and high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> 2080s scenarios, respectively.
