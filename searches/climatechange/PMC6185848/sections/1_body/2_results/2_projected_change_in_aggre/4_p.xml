<p class="p">Changes to current Dsol severity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205711.g005" class="xref">Fig 5Jâ€“5L</xref>) were comparable to those for Pbr under all emissions scenarios, although slightly lower. This is due to the similarity of their temperature-response curves (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0205711.g004" class="xref">Fig 4D</xref>). Geographic variability in the response of Dsol to climate change was also comparable to Pbr, with a mean difference in median monthly changes to current Dsol severity among the constituent countries of GB of 1.6, 3.0, and 4.1% for the low CO
