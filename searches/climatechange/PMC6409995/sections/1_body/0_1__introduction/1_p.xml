<p class="p">Natural systems, human health, and agricultural production have been badly affected by devastating environmental changes [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. With the rapid increase in the world’s population, there is a corresponding increase in food demand owing to concerns about the stability of the global environment. Water availability, air pollution, and soil fertility have a large impact on agriculture productivity [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. With abrupt changes in environmental conditions, the harsh impacts on plant productivity are progressing in great intensities owing to direct and indirect effects of abiotic stresses. Because of the continuous deforestation and excessive utilization of fossil fuels, the concentration of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has escalated from 280 µmol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 400 µmol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in the atmosphere. It is predicted that the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration will elevate two-fold, i.e., up to 800 µmol
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at the end of this century. Emission of dangerous gases, especially CO
 <sub class="sub">2,</sub> are the main factors for the greenhouse effect and warmer average global temperatures [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The effects of climate change and environmental variation are mainly estimated by the number of stress spells, their impact on daily life, and damage to agricultural crops [
 <xref rid="B4-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In developing countries, agricultural yield is predominantly suffered due to adverse environmental conditions, therefore high temperature and excess of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> accumulation forced scientists to devise new strategies to cope with less predictable challenges [
 <xref rid="B5-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. To tackle these limitations and guaranteed food security there is a need for production of new climate-smart crop cultivars [
 <xref rid="B6-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Plant growth and yield are greatly influenced by abiotic stresses. Under natural climate conditions, plants often experience numerous stresses like waterlogging, drought, heat, cold, and salinity [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The abiotic factors also include UV-B, light intensities, flooding, gas emissions, and physical and chemical factors which induce more stresses [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In the 21st century, the Earth’s average temperature is expected to increase from 2 to 4.5 °C. According to IPCC-2014 (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.ipcc.ch/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ipcc.ch/</uri>), the time-span between the 19th and the 21st centuries is considered to be the period which experienced the most warming [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Extreme precipitation events might well cause destructions due to floods whereas the scarcity or the total absence of rainfall for a longer period of time leads to drought stresses [
 <xref rid="B11-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The environment of the globe is continuously changing and industrialization is one of the main factors for temperature increase. Due to extreme weather events the frequency of global warming is expected to rise, which will ultimately disturb the ecosystem globally [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. All living organisms such as plants, animals, fishes, and humans have been affected by the extreme environmental conditions around the globe. The danger to the world’s climate conditions has triggered anxiety among everyone because crop yield might be compromised by fluctuations in various environmental factors that can risk food security. Recent studies reported that the developed countries have more vulnerability towards climatic changes (8–11%) than developing states [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Climate change and food insecurity are the two major issues of the 21st century. Around 815 million people are affected by malnutrition, hindering sustainable development programs to achieve the universal goal of eliminating hunger by 2030 [
 <xref rid="B15-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Food security and agricultural yield is considerably affected by the adverse weather. With elevation in temperature, the production of major crops has been reduced evidently around the world [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. At the end of this century global production of crops is likely to decrease as climatic severity increases from 2.6 to 4 °C. Reduction in the productivity of these crops signifies the main threat to food security, particularly in the speedy increase in the world’s population [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The population is supposed to grow to about 9 billion in 2050 and food requirement are expected to escalate by about 85% [
 <xref rid="B18-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Climatic influences are worsened by present cropping schemes with low variation and elevated concentration of inputs, and unstable productivity due to environmental changes in crops [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The increased frequency of drought and heavy rainfalls, temperature fluctuations, salinity, and insect pest attacks are anticipated to decrease crop productivity leading to higher threats of starvation [
 <xref rid="B20-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Crop adaptability has suffered not only as a result of temperature variations, but also because of rainfall [
 <xref rid="B21-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Currently, the main task is lessening the pressure on food security [
 <xref rid="B22-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. This review emphasizes the influence of weather variations on crop production. The next sections outline the overview of the climate change, stresses produced due to climate change, impacts on agricultural crops, strategies to cope with extreme environmental conditions, and some recent genetically engineered approaches to develop transgenic plants against abiotic stresses.
