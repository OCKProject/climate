<p class="p">Under drought conditions, elevated level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in leaf causes the initiation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) which trigger the multiple stresses in crops. With locked stomata, movement of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> inside the leaf is clogged, and ROS are produced due to enhanced levels of oxygen under drought conditions. The frequency of plant development, photosynthesis, and respiration are disturbed by membrane breakdown due to ROS production. Several cell building materials like carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid are impaired by ROS in drought stress [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. In recent studies, it was observed that Osmo-protectants have been produced under the combined stress conditions of heat and salinity in tomato plants, but do not appear in individual stresses. Another experiment demonstrated that the combined effect of heat and salt stress leads to diverse metabolomic profiling which was established with molecular and physiological statistics. For plant development, ROS has a significant role and it is considered as a crucial secondary signal for cellular metabolism: an elevated level of ROS prompts cell apoptosis. Therefore, a gentle equilibrium among ROS creation and their decontamination may occur in every oxygenated organism [
