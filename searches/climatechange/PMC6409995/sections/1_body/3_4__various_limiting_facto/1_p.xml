<p class="p">For sustainable agriculture and food safety for an increasing population of the world, it is necessary to grow stress-tolerant plants and understand their responses under different stress conditions. In relation to various climatic stresses, the response of plants varies in the expression of genes, physiology, and metabolism. It was reported that plants have the ability to sense any variation in surrounding environmental signals but in spite of many studies, only some reputed sensors have been recognized [

 <xref rid="B78-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Stress-responsive protein creation, high levels of associated solutes, and more elevated antioxidant ratios are the cellular signals which are produced due to salinity, drought, and chemical effluence. These stresses are regarded as primary stresses and they generate secondary stresses like oxidative and osmotic stress [
