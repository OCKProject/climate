<p class="p">Metabolic profiling of various crucial plants have been comprehensively completed under water stress, such as rice, soybean, maize, and tomato. In barley, numerous metabolomic analyses have also been conducted to understand the impact of water scarcity on the oxidative phase, abscisic acid, and free amino acids. Barley cultivars were subjected to water shortage to explore the genetic variation on the metabolomic level at grain formation phase [

Drought stress in coffee has been studied from a wide viewpoint by assimilating the vital features of plant biochemistry and physiology. The plants subjected to multiple events of constant drought stresses have greater photosynthesis processes, in contrast to plants with only one event of drought stress imposed on them. Certainly, these plants showed advance
