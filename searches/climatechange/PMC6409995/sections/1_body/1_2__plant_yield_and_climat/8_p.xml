<p class="p">In temperate regions and humid grassland zones, a slight elevation in temperature may raise the pasture productivity. These advances have to be established to tackle amplified rate of climate changes, for example, drought and temperature extremes in the Mediterranean zone or massive rainfall spells and in temperate areas increase the risk of flooding [

 <xref rid="B63-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Consequently, due to climate changes, many regions of cultivated land may become unsuitable for cultivation, and other tropical regions may produce more crops. Temperature instability will also provide more favorable environmental conditions for insect pests of crops to boost their capacity to stay alive in cold temperatures and then emerge in outbreaks in spring. It is very crucial to observe that in case of food accessibility, all recent calculations for food security and safety have concentrated mainly on the effects of climate changes in ways that did not measure the probability of substantial alteration in the rate of climate extremes on crop productivity. They have also not considered the situations of sudden changes in socio-economic status and climate, so all these factors have been putting negative impacts on global food security and safety [
 <xref rid="B64-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Around the globe, food security is remarkably significant for human beings. Because of climate change, food quality, supply, and safety are still the biggest problems for researchers. Future studies on food security will need to incorporate climate change, crop productivity, water supply, and population to estimate food security conditions entirely and scientifically [
