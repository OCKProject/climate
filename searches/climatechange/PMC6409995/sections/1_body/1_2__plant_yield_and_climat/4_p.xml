<p class="p">Due to climate change, water deficit and temperature extremes influence the reproductive phase of plant growth. It was described that the flower initiation and inflorescence is badly affected by the water stress in cereals [

 <xref rid="B41-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. In rice, drought stress greatly disturbs the process of fertilization and anthesis. Due to water deficit, the harvest index is reduced to 60% and decreases the grain set [

A study based on ECHAM6 climate data was analyzed for North German Plains during two different time durations: 1981–2010 and 2041–2070. The results showed that if the yield for winter wheat is to be sustained, water availability must be guaranteed [
