Whereas the outcomes of abiotic stresses on crop yield are hard to calculate accurately, it is believed that abiotic stresses have a substantial influence on crop production depending upon the extent of damage to the total area under cultivation. In future, the productivity of the major crops is estimated to drop in many countries of the world due to global warming, water shortage, and other environmental impacts [
