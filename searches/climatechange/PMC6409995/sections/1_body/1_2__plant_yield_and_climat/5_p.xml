<p class="p">Drought stress influences wheat during all developmental stages, but grain formation and the reproductive stage are the most critical ones [
 <xref rid="B48-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Wheat yield was decreased from 1% to 30% during the mild drought stress at post-anthesis while this reduction increased up to 92% in case of prolonged mild drought stress at flowering and grain formation [
 <xref rid="B49-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Drought stress has greatly reduced the yield of important grain legumes. Mashbean (
 <italic class="italic">Vigna mungo</italic> L.) yield has been reduced by drought stress from 31% to 57% during the flowering stage while a 26% reduction was reported by drought stress during the reproductive phase [
 <xref rid="B51-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Maleki et al. (2013) reported that the soybean yield has been largely effected by drought stress and a 42% reduction was observed during the grain filling stage of soybean [
 <xref rid="B52-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) described that maize yield was increased at an optimum temperature of 29 °C but a further increase in temperature hampered the yield of maize [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Every 1 °C rise in temperature was found to negatively influence the maize yield [
 <xref rid="B54-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Similarly, it was reported that yield in maize decreased by 8.3% with every 1 °C rise in temperature from the optimum growth temperature [
 <xref rid="B55-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Brown (2009) reported that wheat yield decreased by 10% with every 1 °C increase in temperature [
 <xref rid="B56-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. In another report it was revealed that a 3–4% reduction in wheat yield takes place for every 1 °C increase in temperature [
 <xref rid="B57-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Easterling et al. (2007) described that a 2 °C increase in temperature cause 7% reduction in yield while a further increase in temperature to 4 °C decreased the yield by up to 34% in wheat. Similarly, rice yield decreased by 2.6% for every 1 °C rise in temperature [
 <xref rid="B58-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. In sorghum, yield was reduced by 7.8% due to a 1 °C increase in temperature [
 <xref rid="B59-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In sorghum, water shortage is another big issue reported in most of the world’s top producer countries [
 <xref rid="B60-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Schlenker and Roberts (2009) revealed that the threshold temperature for soybean is 30 °C; a rise in temperature to the optimum level increased soybean yield but after that level, further rise in temperature reduced the yield abruptly [
 <xref rid="B53-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Eastburn et al. (2010) reported that the rise in ozone and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in the atmosphere influenced the disease type, and with a continuous rise in temperature, disease susceptibility in soybean was enhanced [
