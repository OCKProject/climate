<p class="p">With great environmental variability, plants are suffering from unique climatic conditions that limit the plants’ ability to adapt successfully in a range of ways. Due to more spells of rainfall and warmth, plant relocation is not to be the solution to this problem. However, modifications in plant physiology have been beneficial in unique climatic conditions, but environmental variability can be risky for plants [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Morphological, biological, and biochemical mechanisms of plants have been severely affected by abiotic stresses. Although for expected weather conditions in the future, plant physiology reactions are predicted to propagate quickly, with minor variation in fruiting and flowering [

 <xref rid="B89-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">89</xref>]. The ideal temperature for plant development is in the range of 10 to 35 °С. Elevation of the temperature to a specific point will permit plants to generate excess energy but a larger increase in temperature retards the plant growth and the photosynthesis rate abates to deadly levels [
