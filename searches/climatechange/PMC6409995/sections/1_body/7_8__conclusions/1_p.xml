<p class="p">Climate changes are alarming the world by hampering agriculture and its products. Industrialization and poisonous gases cause global warming, which ultimately disturbs the worldâ€™s environment. Climate change has devastating effects on plant growth and yield. Abiotic stresses are the major type of stresses that plants suffer. To understand the plant responses under different abiotic conditions the most pressing current need is to explore the genetic basis underlying these mechanisms. Some bottleneck molecular and physiological challenges present in plants need to be resolved for better plant adaptation under abiotic conditions. Temperature fluctuations and variations in rainfall spells are a very crucial indicators of environmental stresses. Weather variations collectively have positive and negative outcomes but the negative effects are more thought-provoking. It is very difficult to overcome the imbalance in agriculture by climate change. How to tackle this problem and what strategies we should apply are still ambiguous. Hence, researchers need to focus on optimizing plant growth and development in abiotic stresses. For crop resistance against biotic and abiotic stresses, propagating novel cultural methods, implementing various cropping schemes, and different conventional and non-conventional approaches will be adopted to save agriculture in the future. Breeding approaches will help to develop climate resilient crops with better adaptability under drought and heat. Genome wide association studies (GWAS), genomic selection (GS) with high throughput phenotyping, and genotyping strategies are significant in identifying the different genes for crop improvement under climate change. Genetic engineering approaches have been significantly applied to develop transgenic plants with enhanced resistance against different biotic and abiotic stress responses. In future, we have to make eco-friendly genome edited crops through a CRISPR/Cas9 mediated genome editing to battle against climate change.</p>
