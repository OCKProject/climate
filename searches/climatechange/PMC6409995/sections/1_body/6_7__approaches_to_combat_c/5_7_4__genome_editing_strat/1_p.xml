<p class="p">Genome editing (GE) is the most powerful strategy to manipulate the plant genome by means of sequence-specific nucleases. GE for crop improvement has the remarkable ability to tackle food insecurity and develop a climate-smart agriculture system globally [
 <xref rid="B227-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">227</xref>]. In traditional plant breeding approaches, genes are discovered to be associated with various important traits by means of mutation and conventional breeding strategies, which has recognized as a significant technique for the development of elite and high yielding germplasm [
 <xref rid="B228-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">228</xref>]. Genetic diversity of various elite varieties has been substantially decreased due to the exploitation of important crops extensively that has, in various circumstances, been associated with the enhancement of the susceptibility to several abiotic and biotic stresses [

Thus, developing the novel modifications in the gene pool of various plant germplasm is required under abiotic and biotic stresses for the improvement of elite crop varieties with great ability to produce high yielding crops [
 <xref rid="B232-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">232</xref>]. In genome editing technology site specific endonucleases are used comprising of zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator like effector nucleases (TALENs), and CRISPR-Cas9 [
 <xref rid="B233-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">233</xref>]. In contrast to the ZENs and TALENs genome editing tools, the CRISPR/Cas9 system is emerging as the most powerful GE strategy because it is economical, rapid, accurate, and enables multiple site specific editing within the genome [
