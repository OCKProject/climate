<p class="p">Recently some experiments reported investigations of the strategies trialled by farmers to tackle the climatic variation for plant adaptation. There are many useful approaches adopted by farmers, including abiotic factors such as altering planting and harvesting time, a collection of crops with short life cycles, crop rotation, irrigation techniques, and variation in cropping schemes. Under climatic stress conditions, all of these approaches are very beneficial for crop adaptability [

Another plant adaptability approach is by means of crop-management techniques that have the ability to enhance crop development under various environmental stresses. The choice of sowing time, planting density, and optimum irrigation practices are crucial techniques to tackle weather stresses [
