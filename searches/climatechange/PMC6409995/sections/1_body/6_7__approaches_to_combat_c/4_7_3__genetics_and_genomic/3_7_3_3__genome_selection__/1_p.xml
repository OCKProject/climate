<p class="p">Genomic selection (GS) is the exciting tool to revolutionize the crop improvement by using high-throughput phenotyping and marker densities to screen the elite germplasm, improving the polygenic traits and economical breeding line development [

Currently, the prospective of genomic selection (GS) to fast-track the speed of genetic achievements in main crops has stimulated the development of multi-environment designs for genomic estimation. Burgueño et al. (2012) proposed the first statistical design by applying a linear mixed model to G × E model [
 <xref rid="B157-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">157</xref>]. Jarquín et al. (2014) suggested a system of modeling connections among an elevated dimensional combination of markers and environment that integrates with each other (G × E) [

 <xref rid="B159-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">159</xref>]. The modern multi-environment model for genomic prediction was proposed by Cuevas et al. (2017) based on Bayesian model. These methods are applied on 4 wheat and 1 maize cultivars and CIMMYT data bank revealed that the G × E model have high significance rates and better genomic predictions as compared to other models [
