<p class="p">Around 40 research studies based on GS have been published so far. Wheat is the most studied crop with 29 genomic selection studies. Moreover barley, oat, and durum wheat have 5, 2, and 1 research paper published. Diversity Array Technology (DArT) was the most promising maker used in GS followed by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and genotyping by sequencing (GBS). These experiments showed that GS could be magnificently used in cereal breeding [

At CIMMYT, heat and drought stresses were examined in 1000 elite wheat cultivars by using a high throughput phenomics approach [
