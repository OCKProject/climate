<p class="p">The larger subfamily of AP2/EREBP TFs are ERF [
 <xref rid="B188-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">188</xref>] and are responsible to regulate stress-tolerance genes in plants [
 <xref rid="B189-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">189</xref>]. Under abiotic stresses these ERF genes are induced to hyper-express [
 <xref rid="B190-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">190</xref>] results in the better tolerance against stresses in transgenic plants. Additionally, some ERF TFs are also involved both in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance due to their ability to regulate numerous hormonal biosynthesis pathways [
