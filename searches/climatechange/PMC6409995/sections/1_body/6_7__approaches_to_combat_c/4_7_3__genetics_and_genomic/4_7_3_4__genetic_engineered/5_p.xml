<p class="p">Another important family of TFs are WRKY which are extensively distributed in relation to abiotic [
 <xref rid="B209-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">209</xref>] and biotic stresses in plants [
 <xref rid="B210-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">210</xref>]. In transgenic plants WRKY genes were over-expressed to increase the abiotic stress tolerance such as in transgenic rice 
 <italic class="italic">OsWRKY11</italic> gene was introduced to enhance its tolerance to heat and drought stresses [
 <xref rid="B211-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">211</xref>]. Zhou et al. (2008) conducted an experiment on 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> to make it resistant against different stress conditions. 
 <italic class="italic">GmWRKY21</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GmWRKY54</italic> were over-expressed in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> to improved resistance to cold and drought stress respectively [
 <xref rid="B212-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">212</xref>]. Niu et al. (2012) investigated the 
 <italic class="italic">TaWRKY19</italic> gene over-expression in transgenic wheat to freezing, drought, and salinity stresses [
 <xref rid="B213-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">213</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">TaWRKY1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">TaWRKY33</italic> isolated from wheat was used to develop transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> against drought and heat tolerance [
 <xref rid="B214-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">214</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">ZmWRKY33</italic> genes in maize have been induced for salinity, drought, freeze, and ABA stresses. Under salinity stress conditions transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> with over-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">ZmWRKY33</italic> genes showed significant tolerance [
 <xref rid="B215-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">215</xref>]. Dehydration tolerance was increased in transgenic Chrysanthemum with the over-expression of
