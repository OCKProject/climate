<p class="p">MYB TFs family called the myeloblastosis oncogene is a huge group of TFs discovered in eukaryotes and is extensively distributed in plants [
 <xref rid="B194-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">194</xref>,
 <xref rid="B195-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>]. Various MYB TFs have been identified to regulate numerous biochemical and physiological pathways such as the cell cycle, hormonal biosynthesis, and primary and secondary metabolism. These TFs are also known to have functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses [
 <xref rid="B196-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">196</xref>]. Li et al. (2015) have summarized various MYB TFs related to abiotic stress tolerance in plants and 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B195-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">195</xref>]. Some of the MYB TFs such as 
 <italic class="italic">AtMYB61, AtMYB60,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">AtMYB44</italic> were identified to enhance the drought resistance in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> by controlling the movement of stomata [
 <xref rid="B197-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">197</xref>,
 <xref rid="B198-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">198</xref>,
 <xref rid="B199-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">199</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">AtMYB96</italic> gene was expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> as a regulator, either by ABA signaling pathways to impart drought resistance [
 <xref rid="B200-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">200</xref>] or by controlling the biosynthesis process of cuticle wax [
 <xref rid="B201-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">201</xref>]. Yang et al. (2012) developed transgenic rice by over-expressing the 
 <italic class="italic">OsMYB2</italic> gene to improve the resistance of rice against chilling, salinity, and dehydration [
 <xref rid="B202-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">202</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">GmMYB76</italic> gene isolated from soybean was successfully transformed into 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> for salinity and freeze resistance [
 <xref rid="B203-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">203</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">MdMYB121</italic> from apple was significantly transformed into apple and tomato to develop transgenic plants with enhanced drought and salt tolerance [
 <xref rid="B204-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">204</xref>]. Chen et al. (2017) reported that the 
 <italic class="italic">ZmMYB30</italic> gene isolated from maize was transformed into 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> to enhanced tolerance against salinity [
 <xref rid="B205-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">205</xref>]. Similarly, the 
 <italic class="italic">MdSIMYB1</italic> gene from apple was used to developed transgenic tobacco and apple with improved resistance against cold, drought, and salt stresses [
 <xref rid="B206-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">206</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">TaPIMP1</italic> gene was expressed to develop transgenic wheat and it showed remarkable tolerance against drought and fungal pathogen 
 <italic class="italic">Bipolaris sorokiniana.</italic> Hyper-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">TaPIMP1</italic> was confirmed by microarray analysis [
 <xref rid="B207-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">207</xref>]. In another experiment 
 <italic class="italic">TaPIMP1</italic> TF was investigated for its regulating ability to tackle biotic and abiotic stresses in transgenic tobacco. Transgenic tobacco showed resistance against 
 <italic class="italic">Ralstonia solanacearum</italic>, salinity, and drought stresses [
