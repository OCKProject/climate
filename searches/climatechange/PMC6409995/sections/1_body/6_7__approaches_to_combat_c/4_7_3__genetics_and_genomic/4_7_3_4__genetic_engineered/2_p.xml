<p class="p">Various transcriptions factor (TFs) are recognized as plant-specific TFs which includes AP2/ERFBP group [
 <xref rid="B167-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">167</xref>]. This family of AP2/ERFBP TFs is responsible for many plant growth pathways and has functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses [
 <xref rid="B168-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">168</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">AP2/EREBP</italic> TFs are categorized into 4 sub-groups based on their similarity and numbers. The subfamilies consist of ERF TFs, DREB (dehydration-responsive element-binding protein), AP2 (Apetala 2), TFs, and RAV (related to 
 <italic class="italic">ABI3/VP1</italic>). DREB and ERF are two major subfamilies which have been widely examined due to their role in plant biotic and abiotic responses [
 <xref rid="B169-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">169</xref>]. The DREB TFs have significant regulating ability in various water deficit and cold stress conditions [
 <xref rid="B170-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">170</xref>]. DREB TFs have been investigated in response to stresses in various plants species such as wheat, barley, maize, soybean, rice, tomato, and 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> [
 <xref rid="B171-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">171</xref>,
 <xref rid="B172-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">172</xref>,
 <xref rid="B173-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">173</xref>]. In numerous experiments 
 <italic class="italic">DREB1</italic> has been studied in rice and 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> for its controlling mechanism in cold stress while 
 <italic class="italic">DREB2</italic> functions in drought, salinity, and high temperature stresses [
 <xref rid="B174-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">174</xref>,
 <xref rid="B175-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">175</xref>,
 <xref rid="B176-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">176</xref>]. The 
 <italic class="italic">DREB1</italic> TFs were over-expressed to develop transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> with a better ability to withstand salinity, drought, and freezing stresses [
 <xref rid="B177-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">177</xref>,
 <xref rid="B178-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">178</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">DREB1</italic> genes were introduced into the rapeseed, rice, tomato, and tobacco for cold stress resistance [
 <xref rid="B179-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">179</xref>,
 <xref rid="B180-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">180</xref>,
 <xref rid="B181-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">181</xref>,
 <xref rid="B182-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">182</xref>]. Many of the 
 <italic class="italic">DREB1</italic> genes have also been purified from wheat, rye, maize, rice, and oilseed rape and have been transformed to develop transgenic crops against different abiotic stress [
 <xref rid="B183-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">183</xref>,
 <xref rid="B184-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">184</xref>]. Qin et al. (2007) isolated the 
 <italic class="italic">ZmDREB2A</italic> gene from maize and over-expressed in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> to developed transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> with improved resistance against drought stress [
 <xref rid="B185-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">185</xref>]. Similarly Chen et al. (2007) revealed that the transgenic plants with over-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">GmDREB2</italic> gene extracted from soybean showed significant tolerance against salt and drought resistance [
 <xref rid="B186-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">186</xref>]. Mallikarjuna et al. (2011) successfully developed transgenic rice with the improved resistance against salinity and drought stresses by over-expressing the 
 <italic class="italic">OsDREB2A</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B187-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">187</xref>].
