<p class="p">NAC TFs have significant importance in many processes, such as flower growth, cell division, and stress-responsive regulation in the plant due to biotic and abiotic stresses [
 <xref rid="B217-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">217</xref>,
 <xref rid="B218-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">218</xref>]. Numerous NAC TFs have been discovered in a wide range of plants with sequenced genomes such as in rice with 151, in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> 117 [
 <xref rid="B219-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">219</xref>], in maize 152 [
 <xref rid="B220-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">220</xref>], and in soybean 152 [
 <xref rid="B221-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">221</xref>] NAC TFs have been identified. Additionally, a large number of NAC TFs have been reported to have direct association in abiotic stresses, such as in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> 31 NAC genes, which have been identified for salinity tolerance [
 <xref rid="B222-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">222</xref>], and in rice 40 NAC genes were identified against drought tolerance [
 <xref rid="B223-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">223</xref>]. In sorghum the expression of 
 <italic class="italic">SbSNAC1</italic> gene was induced by salt and drought stress and over-expression of this gene in transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> showed drought resistance [
 <xref rid="B224-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">224</xref>]. Zheng et al. (2009) developed transgenic rice by over-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">OsNAC045</italic> which conferred drought and salt tolerance [
 <xref rid="B225-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">225</xref>]. Over-expression of 
 <italic class="italic">OsNAC1</italic> in transgenic rice was studied for salinity and drought tolerance [
 <xref rid="B226-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">226</xref>].
