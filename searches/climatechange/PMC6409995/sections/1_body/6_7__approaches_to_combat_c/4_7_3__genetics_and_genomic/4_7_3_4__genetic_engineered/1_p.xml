<p class="p">Biotechnology is an influential approach for genetic manipulation of the genome for the betterment of human beings. The genetic modification through biotechnology is a powerful strategy. Encouraging data is collected from genetics which can be exploited significantly to various biotic and abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, heat, and cold. Identification of stress-responsive TFs are powerful findings to develop stress-resistant crop cultivars. These TFs can control the phenotypes of genes in genetic engineered crops associated with various stresses [

There are numerous transgenic plants which have been established by genetic engineering to tackle the biotic and abiotic stresses. These genetically engineered plants demonstrate significant resistance against climatic variations compared to normal plants [
