 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> GWAS study was carried out by Verslues et al. (2013) aided by reverse genetic approaches to elucidate unique genes that accumulate proline under drought stress. The linkage among SNPs of both genotypic and phenotypic data were examined, and specific regions regulating proline accumulation were recognized. Similarly, different proteins controlling the pro-accumulation such as aMADS box protein, Universal Stress Protein A domain proteins, protein phosphatase 2A subunit A3, thioredoxins, ribosomal protein RPL24A, and mitochondrial protease LON1 were identified by using reverse genetics. This research gave insights for proline accumulation under drought stress conditions [
