 <xref rid="B137-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">137</xref>]. By applying QTL mapping Haley and his colleagues successfully developed a wheat variety called “Ripper” which has the ability to withstand the drought conditions of Colorado, without affecting its grain yield and quality [
 <xref rid="B138-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. In 2009 Badu-Aparku and Yallou performed QTL mapping to screen elite maize germplasm with high yield under drought stress [
 <xref rid="B139-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">139</xref>]. Merchuk-Ovant et al. (2016) conducted marker assisted selection studies on bread wheat (
 <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) and durum wheat (
 <italic class="italic">Triticum turgidum</italic> L.) to identify the QTLs related to drought stress [
 <xref rid="B140-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">140</xref>]. Barley is cultivated on a wide range of land across the world but it is severely affected by drought stresses globally. QTL mapping of two novel barley cultivars that have been totally different in their response to drought stresses were selected and QTL mapping study performed for malting characters in double haploid. QTL investigation showed that MSA are specific reliable genomic sections regulating the malting feature which can be helpful [
 <xref rid="B141-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">141</xref>]. Similarly, a recent QTL study was carried out to explore the epistatic mechanism and physiology of QTL for the elucidation of the targeted gene. Under drought stresses, 3 QTL were recognized such as qDTY6.2, qDTY6.1, and qDTY3.1, which have a considerable impact on grain productivity [
 <xref rid="B142-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">142</xref>]. To be resistant under hyper temperature conditions three vital points on the genome of bread wheat have been predicted: 7D, 7B, and 2B [
 <xref rid="B47-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Tahmasebi et al. (2016) performed QTL mapping for a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population of wheat under different stress conditions of flooding, drought, heat, and a combination of both heat and drought simultaneously. QTL mapping showed a 19.6% variation in grain yield under these stress conditions. The authors concluded from this research that the molecular markers could be exploited to explore the unique allelic variations in wheat to enhance the potential to screen drought tolerant cultivars [
