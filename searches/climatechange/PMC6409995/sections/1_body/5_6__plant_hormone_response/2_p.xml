<p class="p">Two different group of scientists found the ABA PYR/PYL/RCAR receptors [

 <xref rid="B102-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>]. PP2C was first observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic> knockouts of abi1-1 and abi2-1 and is regarded as the negative controller of ABA [
 <xref rid="B103-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Similarly, the protein kinase was collected and separated as 
 <italic class="italic">SnRK2</italic> and it is the activator of ABA [

It was identified that acetylsalicylic acid can encourage protoplast cluster development in corn, controlling cell cycle regulation [

 <xref rid="B106-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. Malamy and his colleagues were pioneers in studying the Tobacco Mosaic Virus and established the part of SA in plant-pathogen interaction [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Recent studies on SA described its impacts on fruit productivity, legumes nodulation, temperature resistance, stomata closing, respiration, genes related to senescence, and cell growth [
 <xref rid="B107-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">107</xref>]. Salicylic acid regulations in these events might be secondary because they control the production of further plant stress-responsive hormones [
