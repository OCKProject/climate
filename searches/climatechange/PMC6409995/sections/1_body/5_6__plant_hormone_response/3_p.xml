<p class="p">Phytohormones play a vital part in stress response by modulating different signal transduction mechanisms under climatic variability. One of the most important members of phytohormones is ethylene. It is found in gaseous form and thus enables plant-to-plant connections. A century ago, ethylene was discovered and since then many research studies were carried out to reveal its biosynthesis. Ethylene has a function in the control of seed germination, ripening, leaf growth, and senescence under different abiotic and biotic climatic stresses. It is supposed that ethylene acts as signaling pathway among plant growth and weather variations. Abiotic stresses such as salinity, water logging, high temperature, frost, heavy metal contact, nutrient deficiency, and drought are the reasons which modulate the synthesis of ethylene [

Ethylene response factors (ERFs) in plant ethylene belong to a massive transcription factors (TFs) family and are activated during the different physiological and environmental stresses. There have been extensive investigations on ERF proposing its role in abiotic stresses but until now there is no evidence of any specific signaling pathway under abiotic stresses. In a recent study, ERFs in tomato were subjected to drought, salinity, heat, cold, and excessive water conditions for their expression profiling [
