<p class="p">Under different abiotic stresses, hormones are very crucial for regulating many signaling pathways and responses such as salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA), and ethylene [
 <xref rid="B97-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. The major role is played by ABA in the regulation of stress responses by the interactions with some other hormones as shown in crosstalk (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-08-00034-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The most important and vital hormone for regulating the climatic stresses in the plant is ABA. ABA plays a major role in different stages of plant development particularly in stomata opening and closing, drought stress, seed germination, and dormancy. PYR/PYL/RCAR-PP2C-
 <italic class="italic">SnRK2</italic> is recognized as a signaling cascade generated by ABA and controls the seed dormancy efficiently. Under drought conditions, the plant growth is severely retarded and it increases the ABA concentration in cells. ABA accumulation during drought stress controls transpiration and inhibit stomatal disclosure [
 <xref rid="B98-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. ABA also triggers many physiological mechanisms in plants such as water scarcity, regulates stomata to close down, and produces many stress-responsive genes in this period [
 <xref rid="B99-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. ABA signaling machinery have been investigated recently and their mechanism of operation was elucidated. The signaling cascade consisted of 3 units, SnRK2/OST1 (Protein kinase), PP2C (protein phosphatases) and PYR/PYL/RCAR proteins [
