<p class="p">In this context, understanding the stress-resistance processes in plants has emerged as a very difficult task for plant scientists in order to develop stress-resistant plants [
 <xref rid="B72-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The chief cereal crops around the world, such as maize, rice, and wheat, are crucial to meet the daily food demand. Out of them, wheat was the leading staple crop which has been cultivated on a large scale [
 <xref rid="B73-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Wheat is harvested on 38.8% of total agricultural land worldwide and provides a considerably high concentration of proteins: 15% per gram as compared to maize or rice which only supplies 2 to 3% [
