<p class="p">With the increase of the Earthâ€™s temperature, the climate undergoes severe alterations and becomes abiotically stressful. Environmental changes are very damaging and pose various threats to naturally prevailing crop species [

 <xref rid="B67-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. It is reported that plants require an optimum temperature for their normal growth and blooming. Plant physiology is heavily influenced by temperature fluctuations [
 <xref rid="B68-plants-08-00034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. As heat stress affects the grain production and yield, cold stress results in sterility, and drought stress negatively influences the morpho-physiology of plants [
