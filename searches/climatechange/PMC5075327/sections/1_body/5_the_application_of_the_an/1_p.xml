<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> gives an overview of all CCA actions identified from interviews and document analysis. As pointed out in the “
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Methods</xref>” section, we focused on actions within the Federal Province of Tyrol, which means that national and EU level actions were not considered. Austrian provinces have a relatively broad scope of action regarding CCA since many relevant competences are allocated to the nine regional governments in Austria (e.g. Spatial Planning Law, Nature Protection Law, social policies). Furthermore, the provinces are responsible for the implementation of national and EU policies on agriculture, water or soil protection.
