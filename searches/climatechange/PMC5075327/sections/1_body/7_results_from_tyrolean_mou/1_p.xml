<p class="p">The results from the case study show that regional adaption actions are very broad and occur in various ways. As in other studies (e.g. Comoé and Siegrist 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2015</xref>), interviewees expect that most Tyrolean farmers are aware and already have observed impacts of climate change. Nonetheless, only a few explicit CCA were identified. More than half of the identified actions were not motivated by climate change. Such hidden or multi-purpose did not gain much recognition in past CCA literature. Even autonomous CCA gained only little attention in literature (Thornton and Manasfi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2010</xref>), as most scholars focus on planned CCA (e.g. Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2007</xref>; Geneletti and Zardo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2016</xref>). Bonzanigo et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2014</xref>) state 
 <italic class="italic">“it is crucial to include an assessment of farmers’ autonomous adaptation into the design and evaluation of rural policy measures.”</italic> It can be assumed that hidden and multi-purpose CCA action do not only play a role in Tyrolean agriculture, but will also be relevant in other sectors and elsewhere. These “hidden CCA” can be considered as autonomous from the perspective of climate change, but might be clearly planed and motivated from other intentions, such as market stabilization or nature conservation. Tompkins et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2010</xref>) modified an IPCC definition by adding 
 <italic class="italic">“whether or not motivated by climate”</italic> for their assessment of adaptation in the UK and thus considered hidden CCA. It is remarkable that the majority of hidden adaptations from the case study promise an increase of the sector’s resilience by strengthening the farmer’s adaptability through decentral, self-organized social networks for autonomous co-learning and experimentation, while many adaptation measures in literature focuses on technical solutions such as climate information systems or irrigation (Smit and Skinner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2002</xref>).
