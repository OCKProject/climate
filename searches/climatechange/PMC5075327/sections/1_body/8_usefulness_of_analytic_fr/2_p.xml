<p class="p">Effective adaptation actions should be tailored to regional conditions (Reyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2012</xref>), and consider regional actors’ needs, perceptions and motivations to address the limited “intent to implement” as a notable barrier (Öhlmer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">1998</xref>). Adger and Barnett (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2009</xref>) state that “adaptive capacity will not necessarily translate into action”, it needs an initial impulse which could be given through motivation.
