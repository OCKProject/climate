<p class="p">The concept of hidden CCA can be connected to the concept of second generation adaptation which does not primarily focus on predicted biophysical threats, but considers special contexts and underlying vulnerabilities (Boyd and Cornforth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>). The idea of mainstreaming adaptation takes a similar direction and aims at integrating adaptation issues into ongoing (policy) processes to consider sector specific contexts (UNEP 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2011</xref>). The common idea is to see CCA in the bigger context of sector-specific drivers and motivations, which may help to push the sectorâ€™s adaptability. Poly-rational multi-purpose adaptations, as also highlighted by the framework, directly consider climate change next to other sector-specific drivers.
