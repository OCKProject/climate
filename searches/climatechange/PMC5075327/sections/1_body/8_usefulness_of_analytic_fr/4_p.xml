<p class="p">The focus on technical solutions and adaptation measures (esp. in agriculture, e.g. Bird et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>; Esteve et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>) also appears to be problematic. We are more and more often challenged with infrequent and unpredictable extreme events which may result in power failure, but technical solutions mostly depend on electrical power. Many of the hidden CCA are “soft” measures, focusing on long term learning processes, self-organization, local knowledge and adaptive governance, which are considered as key for CCA (Adger et al.
