<p class="p">Against this background, we want to provide an analytic framework for a functional perspective on adaptation that considers all actions—intentional, semi-intentional and non-intentional—that improve a sector’s adaption to climate change. A case study from mountain agriculture in Tyrol (Austria) illustrates the applicability of the analytic framework. We selected the case, because mountains are among the most vulnerable regions in the world (Messerli and Ives 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">1997</xref>) and experience climate change impacts earlier and in a more pronounced manner (Ingold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore agriculture is a sector particularly affected by climate change. Agricultural production primarily takes place outdoors and directly depends on climatic conditions (Lobell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2008</xref>; Vermeulen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2012</xref>). Adaptation research in mountain regions has a strong focus on developing countries, especially Peru, Nepal and India (McDowell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>). Studies about mountain regions in ‘developed’ countries are the exception and often focus on tourism (e.g. Behringer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2000</xref>; Hoffmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2009</xref>; Scott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2007</xref>). CCA is also important to sustain sensitive mountain ecosystems in ‘developed countries’ and their multifunctional services going far beyond food production, such as water provision, biodiversity, landscape amenities, recreation or identity (Schermer and Kirchengast 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2006</xref>).
