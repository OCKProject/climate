<p class="p">Because of the observability of impacts of climate change (CC) in ecosystems, societies and economies (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>), attention to adaptation has increased significantly for the past few years. Numerous scholars analyzed climate change adaptation (CCA) and literature grew at a rate of several hundred papers per year (Perry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2015</xref>). Although the concept of CCA has got so much attention from scholars all over the world, the limits and barriers in practice are still manifold (e.g. Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2007</xref>; Dow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ford and King 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>). Identifying such obstacles (e.g. Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2013</xref>; Moser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010</xref>) may be a promising approach to overcome them, but we could also question the role of our conceptualization of CCA and if it actually helps in overcoming such limits and barriers. CCA is seen as a 
 <italic class="italic">“process of adjustment”</italic> (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>) in response to climatic stimuli (Smit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2000</xref>), but this often used definition reflects the “first-generation adaptation” approach that aims at particular adaptation solutions to particular CC problems (Boyd and Cornforth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2013</xref>). “Second-generation adaptation” offers a more comprehensive view as it also addresses the context in which hazards occur (Burton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2002</xref>) and frames adaptation more in the sense of sustainability and resilience (e.g. Boyd et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>; Ensor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2011</xref>; Eriksen and O’Brien 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2007</xref>). Following an intentional perspective, a very common conceptual differentiation is that between autonomous and planned adaptation (for a more detailed description of different concepts see “
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Climate change impacts and mountain agriculture</xref>” section). Autonomous adaptation is seen as 
 <italic class="italic">“spontaneous adjustment”</italic> (Carter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1994</xref>), which 
 <italic class="italic">“does not constitute a conscious response to climatic stimuli”</italic> (Malik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2010</xref>). Whereas planned adaptations are “based on an awareness” (Malik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2010</xref>) and 
 <italic class="italic">“require conscious intervention”</italic> (Fankhauser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">1999</xref>). Although both types are recognized by several scholars (e.g. Smit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2000</xref>), most empirical studies focus on planned adaptations (e.g. Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2007</xref>; Kates et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2012</xref>; Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, adaptation in practice does not always follow the concept of planned adaptation, it is often reactive (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2005</xref>) and non-climatic stressors play a role for adaptability (McDowell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>).
