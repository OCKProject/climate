<p class="p">The following categorization shows three different CC effects on mountain agriculture (see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The first shows impacts (incremental changes and extreme events) on a global level. These impacts can change global framework conditions which, in turn, do also indirectly affect the regional level. The other two do directly affect the regional level, but are very different in their frequency of occurrence and intensity: incremental changes and extreme events.
