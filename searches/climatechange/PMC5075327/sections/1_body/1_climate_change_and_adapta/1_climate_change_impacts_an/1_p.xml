<p class="p">CC impacts on mountain agriculture in Austria are expected to be quite ambivalent. On the one hand, mountain regions are among the most vulnerable regions worldwide and agriculture is heavily exposed to climatic conditions and climatic change due to its mode of production (Behringer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2000</xref>). Climate variations affect crop yields and lead to changes in food prices (Rosenzweig and Perry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">1994</xref>), so that several adaptation options could be identified, such as irrigation or changing cropping practices, patterns, and planting dates (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>). This might result in the assumption that mountain agriculture is very vulnerable and there is a high demand for adaptation. On the other hand, mountain regions in Austria are often seen as a “winner” of climate change. A general raise in crop and pasture yields is predicted for mid- to high-latitude regions in case of moderate warming (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>). Mitter et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>) predict a strong growth in productivity of grasslands, which is the main land use type in Tyrol until the middle of the twentyfirst century. Observations show that the temperature rise from nineteenth century until the end of the twentieth century in the Austrian Alps was about twice as large as the northern-hemispheric average (Auer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2007</xref>). However, climate change effects include direct and indirect effects that go beyond increases of temperature and CO
