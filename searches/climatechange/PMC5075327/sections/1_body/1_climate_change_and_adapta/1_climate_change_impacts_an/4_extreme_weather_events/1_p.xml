<p class="p">Extreme weather events, such as storms, hail, heavy rainfall or droughts, characteristically occur very irregularly and lead to immense damage. Impacts of extreme events on agricultural production are difficult to quantify with models, as they cannot be adequately calibrated and tested (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>). Temperature extremes have changed remarkably and this development will continue in the twentyfirst century and lead to more heat waves (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). There are no consistent trends for heavy rainfalls, but models usually show an increase of heavy rainfalls from autumn to spring (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). Despite some outstanding storm-events during the last few years, a long-term rise in storms cannot be proved (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). Due to the high degree of uncertainty, useful statements regarding the development of extreme weather events can only be made with caution. Extreme weather events however gravely affect agriculture via erosion, harvest shortfalls or damage to farm buildings and infrastructures. Economic effects of extreme events increased during the last three decades in Austria (APCC
