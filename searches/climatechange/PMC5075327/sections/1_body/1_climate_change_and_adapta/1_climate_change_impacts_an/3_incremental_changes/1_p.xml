<p class="p">These steady changes (mainly in temperature and precipitation) were observed in the past and can be predicted for the future. In Austria, the average temperature has increased by two degrees since 1880 (global: one degree) and is expected to further increase by 1.4 degrees until 2050 (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). An increase in precipitation of 10–15 % was observed in mountainous western Austria during the last 150 years. In the twentyfirst century an increase in precipitation is expected for the winter season, while a decrease can be expected for the summer season. The extent of change in precipitation varies between different models (Gobiet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2014</xref>). Neither can we see a clear trend for the annual average precipitation (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). A decrease in the duration of snow cover as well as a decline in surface and volume of all Austrian glaciers has been observed in recent decades (APCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2014</xref>). These incremental changes have direct impacts on mountain agriculture. The growth in productivity on grasslands due to temperature rise and higher CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2014</xref>). Higher temperatures may also favor the spread of invasive weeds or harmful organisms and lead to quality losses of agricultural products (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>). Rising temperature can also become an important limiting factor for livestock, as productivity may be reduced and the risk of disease increases (APCC
