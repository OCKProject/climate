<p class="p">The latest IPCC report defines CCA 
 <italic class="italic">as “the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects. In human systems, adaptation seeks to moderate or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities. In some natural systems, human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects”</italic> (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>). Just like this IPCC characterization, most CCA definitions refer to adjustment in a system in response to climatic stimuli (Smit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2000</xref>). Some scholars distinguish different forms of CCA by most commonly referring to conceptual differentiations like reactive versus anticipatory or autonomous/spontaneous vs. planned adaptation (cf. Table
