<p class="p">Here, we extend previous work to investigate the impacts of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>-borne virus transmission. Specifically, we expand the framework for both 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> to project cumulative months of suitability in current and future (2050 and 2080) climates, and further examine how global populations at risk might change in different climate change scenarios. We explore variation among both climate model selection (general circulation models; GCMs), and potential emissions pathways described in the IPCC AR5 (representative concentration pathways; RCPs). In doing so, we provide the first mechanistic forecast for the potential future transmission risk of chikungunya and Zika, which have been forecasted primarily via phenomenological methods (like ecological niche modeling [

 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic>-borne diseases in a changing climate.
