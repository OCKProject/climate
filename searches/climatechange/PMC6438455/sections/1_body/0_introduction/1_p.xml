 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Current knowledge suggests that the range of mosquito-borne diseases could expand dramatically in response to climate change [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, the physiological and epidemiological relationships between mosquito vectors and the environment are complex and often nonlinear, and experimental work has shown a corresponding nonlinear relationship between warming temperatures and disease transmission [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In addition, pathogens can be vectored by related species, which may be sympatric, or several pathogens may be transmitted by the same vector. Accurately forecasting the potential impacts of climate change on
