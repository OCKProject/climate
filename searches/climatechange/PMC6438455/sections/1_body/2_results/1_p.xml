 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic>, most of the tropics is currently optimal for viral transmission year-round, with suitability declining along latitudinal gradients. Many temperate regions currently lacking major 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> vectors, or otherwise considered unsuitable by previous disease distribution models [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], are mapped as thermally suitable for up to six months of the year by our model. In these regions where vectors are present, limited outbreaks may only occur when cases are imported from travelers (e.g. in northern Australia, where dengue is not presently endemic but outbreaks occur in suitable regions[
 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]; or in mid-latitude regions of the United States, where it has been suggested that traveler cases could result in limited autochthonous transmission[

 <xref rid="pntd.0007213.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]). In total, our model predicts that 6.01 billion people currently live in areas suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> transmission at least part of the year (i.e., 1 month or more) and 6.33 billion in areas suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">albopictus</italic> transmission, with significant overlap between these two populations.
