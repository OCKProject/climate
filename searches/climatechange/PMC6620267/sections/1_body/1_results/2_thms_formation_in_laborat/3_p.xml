<p id="Par10" class="p">As expected, a lower content of the THM precursor organic carbon in water led to less THM formation during disinfection with chlorine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> versus 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). For 5 mg/L instead of 1 mg/L raw water DOC, THM formation at a fixed temperature of 15 °C was significantly higher by an average 315 ± 18% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The increase in THM formation was less than the 500% increase in DOC concentration, which may be due to other limiting factors involved in the complex THM formation reaction kinetics

 </sup>, such as bromide. Indeed, the measured increase in the formation of individual THM compounds at 15 °C was 575 ± 75% for chloroform, but only 49 ± 14% for bromoform (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> in Supporting Information). In our experiments we kept bromide concentrations constant by using a salt buffer solution to dilute DOC. Similarly, our previously published multi-linear regression model derived from THM measurements in 93 Scottish WTPs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> suggests that a 500% increase in water DOC from the annual average of 1.7 mg/L would increase annual average THM concentrations by 352%. The variability of the THMFP measured for a fixed amount of 1 mg/L DOC across the different case study sites indicates that DOC quality is to some extent influential in THM formation (Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref> in Supplementary Information), since it is the only obvious variable between these treatments. However, there is no evidence for changes in DOC quality driving THM seasonality. There was no evidence for higher THM formation per mg DOC in the month of September, when seasonal THM formation peaks, as compared to the other months (Dec, March, June, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and the DOC quality indicators HPI, TPI and HPO were not correlated with total THMs in the monitoring data from the case study sites, if expressed as % of DOC (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), even though absolute HPI and TPI concentrations were positively correlated with total THMs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Golea

 </sup> also concluded that changes in disinfection by-product levels from the chlorination of Scottish waters can mainly be attributed to the concentration of reactive natural organic matter (NOM), rather than changes in NOM reactivity.
