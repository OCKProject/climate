 </sup> identified declining anthropogenic sulphur emission and deposition as the main cause. DOC solubility is suppressed by high soil water acidity, which has lessened in the UK as a result of declining sulphur emission and deposition since the 1980s

 </sup> concluded that increases in temperature are the second most relevant cause, and could account for a 10â€“20% DOC increase.
