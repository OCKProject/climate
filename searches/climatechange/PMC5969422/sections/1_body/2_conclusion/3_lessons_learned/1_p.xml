<p class="p">Several challenges were encountered during the pilot program. From the researchersâ€™ perspective, the biggest challenge was finding ways to align current research goals with the public outreach activities. Although the participating researchers were eager to interact with museum patrons, designing activities that made current information accessible without being overwhelming was at times daunting. This could be minimized by defining clear goals at the beginning of the collaboration. While brainstorming ideas at the first meeting, what is feasible and what is not should be clarified. Any limitations, whether monetary or physical (e.g., a lack of floor space, time constraints), should be defined early. This will also minimize the decision paralysis that can occur when there are simply too many ideas on the table.</p>
