<p class="p">The potential opportunities and rewards of research-museum collaborations are great. By training researchers in communication skills and providing them with opportunities to interact directly with the general public, museum staff can more effectively facilitate public education on timely topics such as climate change. Researchers are able to work with an interdisciplinary team, gain a new and diverse audience for their data, strengthen research communication skills, and broaden the reach of their findings. Most importantly, the museum-going-public can acquire information and participate in hands-on activities that may improve their knowledge and evidence-based decision-making abilities on critical issues. From our perspective, the benefits of these initiatives far exceed the extra effort and challenges they invoke. Museum-researcher collaborations can provide opportunities and direction to strengthen science education in the future.</p>
