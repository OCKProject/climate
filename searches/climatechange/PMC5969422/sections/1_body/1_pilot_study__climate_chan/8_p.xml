<p class="p">Voluntary pre- and post-event surveys were designed to measure general knowledge about extreme weather and climate change, opinions about planning for climate change, willingness to change personal behaviors, and sources of information about climate change (see

 <xref rid="b15-jmbe-19-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). Participants rated their level of agreement with 16 statements covering extreme weather and climate change on a scale of 1 (Disagree) to 4 (Agree). Participants’ pre- and post-event survey responses were compared by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank tests to detect any differences that might be attributed to participation in the event (

In particular, the participants’ level of agreement with statements about the region’s poor air quality and predisposition to serious floods and droughts seemed to shift toward the “Agree” end of the scale. Although the median in relation to the statement about air quality did not change, the view of 15.9% of respondents shifted toward the “Agree” end of the scale, versus only 2.9% of respondents whose views shifted toward the “Disagree” end of the scale (data not shown). All three of these topics were part of the Awareness activities described in
