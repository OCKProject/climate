<p class="p">In addition to identifying common misconceptions about extreme weather and climate, other data gathered through the pilot study provided a baseline of the museum-going-public’s knowledge about extreme weather and climate change resiliency (

While more than 94% of respondents indicated a willingness to become more environmentally friendly in response to climate change (survey questions 14–16), 24% of respondents feel their personal actions have little effect on climate change and 20% feel that climate systems are too large to be affected by human activity (survey questions 12 and 7, respectively). These findings support the need for effective climate science communication that can encourage behavior change at a local level. The opportunity to interact with researchers is meant to encourage action by the visitors. For example, visitors who had a personal experience with flooding at their homes appeared to engage to a greater degree with the flash flood activity and expressed a desire to avoid flood events in the future, taking with them information on installing rain barrels and planting rain gardens to diminish flash flood effects. Additionally, as children assembled emergency kits, they and their parents discussed their own personal emergency awareness and considered how best to ensure that they and their families were prepared for severe weather or other emergency situations.
