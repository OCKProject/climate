<p class="p">The research team designed and conducted an interactive educational event on the topic of climate-related extreme weather at the museum’s RLC. Educational components focused on three key areas: Awareness, Preparedness, and Communication. Hands-on, interactive activities that focused on floods, tornadoes, and storms were designed for visitors of all ages, and in-depth educational materials were shared with older children and adults. Activities ranged from learning what to include in an emergency supply kit to testing various materials for water absorption as part of a flash flood–focused activity. Most activities included takeaway items that encouraged preparedness and behavior changes to lessen the impacts of extreme weather at home and in communities.
