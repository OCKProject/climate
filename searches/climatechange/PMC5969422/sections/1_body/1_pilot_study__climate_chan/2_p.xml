<p class="p">For our collaboration, scientists from the fields of microbiology, urban planning and design, physics, computer science, and art, along with a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) meteorologist/educator and a museum educator, worked together to design an interactive unit at the Research and Learning Center (RLC) at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. Graduate students also participated, gaining valuable hands-on science communication experience (

Researchers who participated in the fellowship received training on climate change and educational activities from the NOAA meteorologist/educator; on public perception and local resources from a local TV meteorologist; and on effective science communication from the museum educator. In addition, one of the researchers briefed the team on a previous study in which she had investigated local understandings and misconceptions related to extreme weather, and data from this study were used to inform topic selection for the museum activities.
