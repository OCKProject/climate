Over the past few years, these institutions have begun to realize the value of forming collaborations to bridge the gap, and pioneering museums across the United States are beginning to work with universities as they build models for on-site science communication. In one successful model, the NSF-supported Living Laboratory initiative (

Children visiting the museum can participate in active studies, and caregivers can talk directly with the scientists to learn more about their areas of expertise. Scientists are trained to communicate clearly with the public, increasing the publicâ€™s ability to understand and apply science concepts.
