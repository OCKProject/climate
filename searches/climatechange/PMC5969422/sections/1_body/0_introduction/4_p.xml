<p class="p">Although many science educators agree on the importance of science communication, their biggest obstacle may be finding an audience outside of the classroom. Collaboration between researchers on a project is common. However, apart from public health initiatives, collaboration to communicate basic, up-to-date science principles is often restricted to partnerships between institutions of higher learning and local Kâ€“12 schools.
