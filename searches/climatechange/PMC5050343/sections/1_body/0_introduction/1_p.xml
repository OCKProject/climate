Recent studies have emphasized the possibility that global climate change can substantially affect the biodiversity and ecosystem via disruption of mutualistic/parasitic associations such as coral-dinoflagellate mutualism, plant-pollinator mutualism, amphibian-trematode parasitism, and many others (
