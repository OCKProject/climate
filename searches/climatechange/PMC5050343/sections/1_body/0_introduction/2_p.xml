<p class="p">The southern green stinkbug 
 <italic class="italic">Nezara viridula</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>), a notorious insect pest infesting diverse crop plants worldwide (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>), is associated with a specific gammaproteobacterial symbiont in a posterior region of the midgut (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). Upon oviposition, females of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> smear symbiont-containing excretion onto the egg surface, which newborn nymphs orally acquire to establish vertical transmission of the symbiont (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Elimination of the symbiont by egg surface sterilization causes severe fitness defects, such as retarded nymphal growth and elevated nymphal mortality, with few juveniles reaching adulthood (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). These results indicate that the obligate nature of the symbiotic association is likely based on provisioning of nutritional components deficient in plant sap diet (
