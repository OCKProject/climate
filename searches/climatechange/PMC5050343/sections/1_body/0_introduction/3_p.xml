<p class="p">Field monitoring of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> in mainland Japan has shown that its northern distribution limit had shifted northward by &gt;85 km during the past 50 years (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" class="xref">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), which has been discussed as a potential case of expanded distribution range northward in association with global warming (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> is easily maintained in the laboratory and is experimentally tractable (

 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>), providing an ideal opportunity to investigate the field observations in the context of experimental settings simulating current and future climate change (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). In this study, using a special rearing incubator whose inner temperature is controllable with reference to outside temperature, we experimentally investigated biological effects of future global warming on 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> and its gut symbiotic bacterium.
