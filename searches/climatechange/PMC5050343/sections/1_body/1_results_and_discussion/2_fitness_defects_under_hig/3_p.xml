<p class="p">Conventionally, although the underlying mechanisms were unknown, researchers have documented that symbiotic microorganisms of many insects are vulnerable to high temperature and that heat-challenged insects with a disrupted symbiotic system often exhibit retarded growth, elevated mortality, reduced fertility, abnormal body color, and other defective phenotypes (
