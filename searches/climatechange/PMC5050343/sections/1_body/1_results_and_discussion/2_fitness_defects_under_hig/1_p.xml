<p class="p">In order to experimentally verify whether the fitness defects occurring under the SW condition in midsummer are attributable to high temperature, we allocated fresh egg masses of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> to different constant temperature conditions at 25.0°C, 27.5°C, 30.0°C, 32.5°C, and 35.0°C using a long-day regime (16 h light/8 h dark) in laboratory climate incubators, reared them to adulthood, and measured their fitness parameters. As the rearing temperature increased from 25.0°C to 32.5°C, the survival rate declined, the nymphal period tended to be prolonged, and the adult body size became smaller. No nymphs reached the adult stage at the highest temperature of 35.0°C (
