<p class="p">The fitness defects were not observed under the QN conditions in midsummer (mean temperatures of 25.9 ± 1.6°C in July and 26.6 ± 1.8°C in August), whereas the fitness defects were prominent under the SW conditions in midsummer (mean temperatures of 28.6 ± 1.6°C in July and 29.4 ± 1.8°C in August) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>). These patterns are in agreement with the results obtained under the constant temperature conditions in the laboratory, wherein rearing at 25.0°C and 27.5°C caused no fitness defects, whereas rearing at 30.0°C resulted in remarkable defective phenotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). These results indicate that the fitness defects observed in 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> under the SW condition in midsummer were due to high-temperature stress.
