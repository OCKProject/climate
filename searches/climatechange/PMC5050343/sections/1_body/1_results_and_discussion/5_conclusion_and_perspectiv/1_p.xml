<p class="p">From all these results taken together, we conclude that high temperature conditions can suppress the obligate bacterial symbiont of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic>, thereby damaging the host insect indirectly and causing the heat-associated defective host phenotypes. Our laboratory data obtained under the strictly controlled environmental conditions (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>) and our simulated warming data obtained in the seminatural settings (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) in combination with the field monitoring data that have been accumulated for decades (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" class="xref">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>) provide an insightful and integrated perspective as to how elevated temperature associated with global warming can impact insects and other organisms indirectly via affecting symbiotic/mutualistic microbial associates. For example, the northern distribution limit of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic>, which is temperature dependent and has recently been shown to be shifting northward in the Northern Hemisphere (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" class="xref">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>), might be substantially influenced not only by the host genotype but also by the symbiont genotype. How symbiont-mediated vulnerability to high temperature is relevant to the southern distribution limit of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> is also of great interest and deserves future studies. It is conceivable, although speculative, that host-symbiont interactions, including symbiont-mediated heat vulnerability, could differ among local populations of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15" class="xref">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>), a cosmopolitan species widely distributed from the temperate to tropical regions in the world (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). On account of the notorious pest status of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic>, such symbiont-mediated constraints on its distribution range are not only of ecological interest but also of practical relevance to, for example, prediction of its potential distribution range as an introduced insect pest.
