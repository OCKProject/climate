<p class="p">Considering the omnipresence of microbial symbioses in nature, such phenomena, rather than being restricted to insect-microbe symbiotic associations, must also be found in other symbiotic systems such as coral-dinoflagellate photosynthetic associations, wherein high temperature-induced symbiosis collapse is called “coral bleaching” (

In evaluating the ecological impact of global climate change, we must not forget to take into account the unseen microbial entities that are ubiquitously associated with a myriad of organisms and often play substantial biological roles therein.
