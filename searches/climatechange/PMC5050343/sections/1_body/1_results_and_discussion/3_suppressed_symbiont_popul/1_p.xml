<p class="p">When the insects reared under the QN condition and the SW condition were subjected to symbiont quantification, remarkable differences between the treatments in symbiont titers were detected: whereas symbiont titers under the QN condition were constantly around 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> per insect from June to September, symbiont titers under the SW condition were drastically suppressed to 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> per insect specifically in midsummer (

When the insects reared under different constant temperatures were subjected to symbiont quantification, notable differences in symbiont titers between the temperature conditions were also detected: whereas symbiont titers under the lower temperatures (25.0°C and 27.5°C) were around 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> per insect, symbiont titers under the higher temperatures were significantly suppressed to 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> per insect at 30.0°C and to less than 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> per insect at 32.5°C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">H</xref>). These results indicate that the high temperature conditions (i.e., the SW condition in midsummer and the constant laboratory temperatures of 30.0°C and 32.5°C) resulted in not only the host’s fitness defects but also the symbiont’s population decline.
