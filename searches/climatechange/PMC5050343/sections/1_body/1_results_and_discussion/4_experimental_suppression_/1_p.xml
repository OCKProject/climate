<p class="p">There are two alternative hypotheses to account for these patterns: (i) the high temperature conditions primarily affected the heat-vulnerable symbiont and the suppression of the obligate symbiont resulted in the host’s fitness defects or (ii) the high temperature conditions primarily damaged the host insect and, as a consequence of the disturbed physiology/performance of the host, the symbiont population was suppressed. In an attempt to test these hypotheses, we experimentally suppressed the symbiont population without heat stress (rearing at 25.0°C) using a low dose of antibiotic (0.001 mg/ml rifampicin) administered via drinking water to the host insects (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">Fig. S1B</xref> in the supplemental material). Interestingly, the symbiont suppression by the antibiotic treatment, in which symbiont titers of around 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> in the control insects were reduced to 10
 <sup class="sup">4</sup> or less in the antibiotic-treated insects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4D</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">H</xref>), resulted in induction of defective phenotypes for the host that were quite similar to those observed under the high temperature conditions, namely, reduced survival rate, prolonged nymphal period, smaller body size, and abnormal yellowish body color (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). These results strongly favor the former hypothesis in that the suppression of symbiont population without the heat stress can reproduce the host’s defective phenotypes. Meanwhile, the possibility should be kept in mind that the antibiotic treatment may have directly damaged not only the symbiont but also the host to some extent.
