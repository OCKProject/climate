<p class="p">We collected egg masses of an 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> strain derived from the current northern limit of the species and reared the sibling insects inside and outside the simulated warming incubator that was placed outdoors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">D</xref>). Within the incubator, temperature was controlled at 2.5°C higher than outside, which is close to the average of the temperature increase range of global warming predicted to occur by 2100 (i.e., 0.3°C to 4.8°C) (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>). Fresh egg masses were divided and randomly allocated to either the quasinatural (QN) condition (i.e., outside the incubator) or the simulated warming (SW) condition (i.e., inside the incubator) on 5 June, 5 July, 5 August, and 5 September 2009 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">Fig. S1A</xref> in the supplemental material). Nymphs hatched soon, and their fitness parameters, including survival rate (i.e., survival rate from hatching to adult emergence), nymphal period (i.e., period from hatching to adult emergence), adult body length, and adult body coloration, were recorded. Overall, the fitness parameters tended to be significantly different between the QN condition and the SW condition, whereas the patterns contrasted between the moderately warm early summer/autumn (June/September) and hot midsummer (July/August) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Specifically, under the SW condition, the nymphal period tended to be shorter in June and September, whereas it tended to be longer in July and August (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">F</xref>), and adult body size tended to be smaller in July and August, whereas no size differences were detected between the treatments in June and September (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">G</xref>). In addition to the reduced body size, many adult insects reared under the SW condition in midsummer exhibited yellowish abnormal body coloration, whereas those reared under the QN condition in midsummer were normally green in color (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2E</xref>; see also 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>). These patterns, namely, a prolonged nymphal period, a reduced body size, and abnormal body coloration under the SW condition in midsummer, were concordant with those reported in our previous study (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>) in that the effects of the simulated warming were deleterious in the midsummer season.
