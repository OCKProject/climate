<p class="p">In the simulated warming experiments and the antibiotic treatment experiments, Fisher’s exact probability test (used to compare survival rates between treatments), Mann-Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic> test (used to analyze duration of the nymphal period and body length), and median test (used to analyze symbiont quantity) were employed. In the constant-temperature rearing experiments, the Tukey-type multiple-comparison test for proportions (used to compare survival rates between treatments), Tukey HSD (honestly significant difference) multiple-comparison test (used to analyze the duration of the nymphal period and the body length), and Kruskal-Wallis test followed by multiple comparisons of mean ranks test (used to analyze symbiont quantity) were adopted. Multiple comparisons were corrected by the Bonferroni method. All statistical analyses were performed using the program Statistica 7.0 (StatSoft).
