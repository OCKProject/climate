<p class="p">The following fitness parameters were recorded for the experimental insects: survival rate (the proportion of eggs that reached adulthood); nymphal period (the number of days from egg hatching to adult emergence); and adult body length (the distance from the front edge of clypeus to the caudal tip). For the nymphal period and adult body length data, males and females were analyzed separately because females are larger than males in 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic>. For survival rate data, males and females were analyzed together because nymphal sexing of 
 <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> is difficult. The body length of the adult insects was measured by use of a digital caliper. For recording body color, the adult insects were photographed by using the same digital camera and the same light and distance settings.
