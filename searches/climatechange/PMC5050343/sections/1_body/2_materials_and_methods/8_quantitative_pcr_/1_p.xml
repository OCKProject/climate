<p class="p">Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR green and an Mx3000P QPCR system (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) essentially as described previously (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). On the basis of the 1.6-kb sequence of the symbiont 
 <italic class="italic">groEL</italic> gene, specific internal primers MMAOgroF (5′-AAG CAA ATG ACG CTG CAG GAG-3′) and MMAOgroR (5′-GCT CAA CAG CAG CCA CAA CG-3′) targeting a 140-bp region for quantitative PCR were designed. The PCR mixture (in total, 20 µl) contained 2.0 µl of 10× PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 2.0 µl of GeneAmp deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) (2 mM [each] dATP, dTTP, dGTP, and dCTP), 1.2 µl of 25 mM MgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> solution (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 0.2 µl of SYBR green I (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR, USA), 0.4 µl of primer mixture solution (5 µM [each] forward and reverse primers), 0.1 µl of AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 9.1 µl of distilled water, 1.0 µl of dimethyl sulfoxide, and 4 µl of extracted DNA. The PCR temperature profile was 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 15 s. For calculation of the absolute numbers of the 
 <italic class="italic">groEL</italic> gene copies, 10-fold serial dilutions of the target PCR product, ranging from 10
 <sup class="sup">1</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> gene copies per reaction, were also quantified, and a standard curve was generated for the gene.
