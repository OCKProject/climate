<p class="p">Hatchlings from the stock culture were divided into two groups and randomly allocated to either the antibiotic-treated condition or the nontreated control condition. In the former group, distilled water containing 0.001 mg/ml rifampicin was continuously supplied during the entire nymphal period until the hatchlings reached adulthood or died (up to 56 days after hatching). In the latter group, water without the antibiotic was supplied. In both treatments, water was replaced every third day.
