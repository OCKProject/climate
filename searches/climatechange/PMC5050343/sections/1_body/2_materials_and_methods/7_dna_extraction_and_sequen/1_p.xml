<p class="p">Insects preserved in acetone were dissected in PBS with fine forceps and microscissors under the dissection microscope, and the symbiotic midgut region was isolated. Total DNA was extracted from the dissected symbiotic organ using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Successful extraction of DNA was confirmed by the use of a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) based on the optical density at 260 nm. A 1.6-kb region of the bacterial 
 <italic class="italic">groEL</italic> gene was amplified by PCR with primers Gro-F1 (5′-ATG GCA GCW AAA GAC GTA AAT TYG G-3′) and Gro-R1 (5′-TTA CAT CAT KCC GCC CAT GC-3′) using AmpliTaq gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and a temperature profile of 95°C for 10 min followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 2 min (
