<p class="p">Climate warming was experimentally simulated by using a specially modified LH-350NSZ incubator (NK Systems, Osaka, Japan; for details, see reference

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">Figure S1A</xref> in the supplemental material depicts the experimental design. The temperature ranges under the QN condition were 22.9 ± 2.1°C in June, 25.9 ± 1.6°C in July, 26.6 ± 1.8°C in August, and 22.9 ± 2.1°C in September. The temperature ranges in the SW condition were 25.7 ± 2.1°C in June, 28.6 ± 1.6°C in July, 29.4 ± 1.8°C in August, and 25.6 ± 2.2°C in September. Under these conditions, insects were reared until adult emergence (for approximately 40 to 50 days). Insects were preserved in acetone after adult emergence until DNA extraction (
