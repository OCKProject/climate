  <p class="p">The southern green stinkbug 
   <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> and simulated warming experimental system. (A) A mating pair of 
   <italic class="italic">N. viridula</italic> stinkbugs on a soybean leaf. (B) A dissected midgut of the insect. An arrow indicates the symbiotic organ bearing a number of crypts, which are filled with symbiotic bacteria (see inset). (C) The incubator for the simulated warming condition and adjacent open metal shelves for the quasinatural condition. These facilities were set outdoors, with only a canopy tent cover for protection from direct sunlight and rain. (D) Environmental conditions during the experiment: black line, natural day length; blue line, temperature under the quasinatural condition; red line, temperature under the simulated warming condition. Arrows indicate the dates when egg masses of the insect were allocated to the experimental conditions (Jun, June; Jul, July, Aug, August; Sep, September). Note that the SW condition mimicked the QN condition except that the temperature was 2.5°C higher.
