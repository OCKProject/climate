<p class="p">There are many universal problems with societal impact measurements (Bornmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). Milat et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>) emphasized that “research impacts are complex, non-linear, and unpredictable in nature and there is a propensity to ‘count what can be easily measured’, rather than measuring what ‘counts’ in terms of significant, enduring changes”. In order to tackle the complexity of societal impact measurements, proposed models of impact measurements tended to be complexly designed. These models might be able to measure impact multi-dimensionally, but do not have the right balance between comprehensiveness and feasibility (Milat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2015</xref>). Another problematic part of societal impact measurement is the long time lag before impact manifests in practice. One can expect around 15 years until research evidence is implemented into practice (Balas and Boren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2000</xref>). The US National Research Council (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2014</xref>) lists the following additional “barriers to assessing research impacts: research can have both positive and negative effects (e.g., the creation of chlorofluorocarbons reduced stratospheric ozone); the adoption of research findings depends on sociocultural factors; transformative innovations often depend on previous research; it is extremely difficult to assess the individual and collective impacts of multiple researchers who are tackling the same problem; and finally, it is difficult to assess the transferability of research findings to other, unintended problems” (p. 75).
