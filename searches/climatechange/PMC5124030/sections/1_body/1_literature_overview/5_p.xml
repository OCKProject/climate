<p class="p">Although the literature overview on societal impact studies of Bornmann (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>) reveal many proposals to measure societal impact quantitatively, Wilsdon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>) highlight only two metrics which might reflect wider societal impact: (1) Google patent citations and (2) clinical guideline citations. (Ad 1) The analysis of the reference list in patents can be used to assess the contribution of publicly funded research to innovations in industry (Kousha &amp; Thelwall, in press; Ovseiko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>). (Ad 2) Grant (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1999</xref>) proposed to use citations to publications in clinical guidelines to “quantify the progress of knowledge from biomedical research into clinical practice” (p. 33). The analysis of 43 UK guidelines shows, i.e., that “within the United Kingdom, Edinburgh and Glasgow stood out for their unexpectedly high contributions to the guidelines’ scientific base” (Lewison and Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2008</xref>, p. 1944). The results of Andersen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2013</xref>) point out that the quality of clinical guidelines correlates positively with the citation impact of the cited literature. Thus, quality in research and practice seems to be (closely) related.
