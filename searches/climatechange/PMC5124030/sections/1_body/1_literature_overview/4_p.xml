<p class="p">The use of the case study approach for measuring societal impact is positively as well as negatively assessed in the scientometric literature. The preparation of case studies means a high effort for an institution. David Price, the vice-provost for research at the University College London, said that the university alone “wrote 300 case studies that took around 15 person-years of work, and hired four full-time staff members to help” (Van Noorden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2015</xref>, p. 150). According to Wilsdon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>) case studies “offer the potential to present complex information and warn against more focus on quantitative metrics for impact case studies. Others however see case studies as ‘fairy tales of influence’ and argue for a more consistent toolkit of impact metrics that can be more easily compared across and between cases” (p. 49, see also Atkinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2014</xref>). For Cohen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2015</xref>) “the holy grail is to find short term indicators that can be measured before, during or immediately after the research is completed and that are robust predictors of the longer term impact … from the research”. Ovseiko et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>) think that important areas of impact can only be captured qualitatively. “However, the emphasis on qualitative indicators would stretch traditional peer review further and concentrate on the most prominent examples of impact, overlooking more modest contributions”.
