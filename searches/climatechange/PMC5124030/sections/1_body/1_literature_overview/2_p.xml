<p class="p">Societal impact measurements are mostly commissioned by governments which argue that measuring the impact on science says little about real-world benefits of research (Cohen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2015</xref>). Nightingale and Scott (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2007</xref>) summarize this argumentation in the following pointedly sentence: “Research that is highly cited or published in top journals may be good for the academic discipline but not for society” (p. 547). Governments are interested to know the importance of publicly-funded research (1) for the private and public sectors (e.g. health care), (2) to tackle societal challenges (e.g. climate change), and (3) for education and training of the next generations (ERiC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2014</xref>). The impact model of Cleary et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2013</xref>) additionally highlights the policy enactment of research, in which the impact on policies, laws, and regulations is of special interest. The current study seizes upon this additional issue by investigating a possible source for measuring policy enactment of research.
