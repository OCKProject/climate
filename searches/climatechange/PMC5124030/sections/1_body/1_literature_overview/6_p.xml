<p class="p">In the current discussion around the quantitative measurement of societal impact, alternative metrics (altmetrics) play an important role (Bornmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>). Altmetrics count views, downloads, clicks, notes, saves, tweets, shares, likes, recommends, tags, posts, trackbacks, discussions, bookmarks, and comments to measure the impact of scholarly publications. Altmetrics are seen as an interesting possibility to measure quantitatively the broad impact of publications: “Funders also often see tremendous value in the general public understanding of publicly funded research projects and the scientific process. Use of alternative assessment metrics may help support needs in these areas” (NISO Alternative Assessment Metrics Project
