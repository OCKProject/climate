<p class="p">There is a wide body of literature available investigating the relationship between academic research and policy making, especially concerning climate research. For example, Ford et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2013</xref>) assess the ‘usability’ of climate change research for decision-making. Using a case study of the Canadian International Polar Year, they introduce a novel approach to quantitatively evaluate the usability of climate change research for informing decision-making. Lemos and Morehouse (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2005</xref>) examine the use of interactive models of research in the regional integrated scientific assessments (RISAS) in the US. They show that highly interactive models increase the possibilities of societal impact. The recent study of Hermann et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2015</xref>) focusses on the expert advices in the field of Austrian climate policy. The authors map the different actors and advisory forms, assess the relevance of scientific knowledge, and identify patterns of science-policy interactions.
