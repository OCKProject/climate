<p class="p">Although mentions of papers in policy documents are not able to solve all these problems, they are an interesting source of data to measure the broader impact of research target-oriented (on policy-related areas in society). Also, the data can possibly serve to shed light on the relationship between academic research and policy making. Decision processes in policy making are “deeply permeated” by active scientists (Lasswell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">1971</xref>, p. 125). Scientists participate in different positions and roles in the policy process, which are combined with different strategies and goals. Typologies of the positions and roles are described by Weiss (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2006</xref>) and Pielke (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2007</xref>). Pielke (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2007</xref>) suggests that the role for scientists in political debate is to “help us to understand the associations between different choices and their outcomes” (p. 139).
