<p class="p">Based on the journals in which the CCP have been published the CCP (and the CCP_P) were assigned to broader subject categories as defined by the OECD (Paris, France).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" class="xref">3</xref> TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> shows the number of CCP and number of CPP_P broken down by these subject categories. Climate change research is hardly comparable with classical research topics (for example like photovoltaics or even nanoscience as a broader field). Due to the fact that nearly all systems on this planet are affected by the impacts of a changing climate, a multitude of quite different disciplines all over science is interacting and cooperating in this demanding field of science. Therefore, it is reasonable to differentiate the impact of climate change research on policy documents with regard to the various disciplines and sub-disciplines involved. Their influence on policy documents can be assumed to be quite different.
