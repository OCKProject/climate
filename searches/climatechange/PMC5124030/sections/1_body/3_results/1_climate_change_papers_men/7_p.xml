<p class="p">The overrepresentation of the “Earth and related environmental sciences” papers among the CCP_P (see the positive difference between the CPP and CPP_P percentages at the top of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>) corresponds to the overrepresentation of the associated journals of this category (in particular the 
 <italic class="italic">Geophysical Research Letters</italic>) presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>. The large positive difference between the CPP and CPP_P percentages for the category 
 <italic class="italic">Social and economic geography</italic> may initially be surprising, because the category is far outside the “classical” climate change related categories, like earth sciences. However, in view of the rapid growth of the publication output dealing with adaptation, impacts and vulnerability of climate change and the emergence of related title words within climate change literature (see the results in Haunschild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>), the overrepresentation of 
 <italic class="italic">Social and economic geography</italic> is understandable.
