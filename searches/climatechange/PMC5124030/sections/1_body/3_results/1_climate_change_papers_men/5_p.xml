<p class="p">In agreement with the relatively high percentages of 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic> papers (i.e. papers with a more general character and thereby review-like) among CCP_P shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, review papers are mentioned comparatively more frequently in CCP_P (12.1 %) than one can expect from the distribution among CCP (5.5 %)—as the results in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> reveal. The opposite is true for research articles (87.9 vs. 94.5 %). Reviews summarize research results of a topic spread out in a variety of specific papers and are therefore more useful for the authors of policy documents. Possibly, the authors (and potential readers) of such documents are unable to cope with more specific research results and to assess their importance and significance for the different questions around climate change.
