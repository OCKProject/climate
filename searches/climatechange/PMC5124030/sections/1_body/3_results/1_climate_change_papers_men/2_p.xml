<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> shows the distribution of the CCP and CCP_P across the publication years. The table focuses on the years 2000 to 2014 in which 2321 CCP_P have been mentioned. Since only 20 CCP_P have been mentioned between 1981 and 1999, these years are not considered in the table. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> compares the distribution of the annual number of CCP with the distribution of the annual number of CCP_P. In this study, the annual percentages of CCP are used as the expected values of which the annual percentages of CCP_P more or less differ (see the column “Difference between percentages”). A positive (negative) percentage means that the authors of the policy documents are more (less) interested in the CCP of a year than one can expect.
