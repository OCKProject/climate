<p class="p">The time-curve of the citations referenced by scientific papers usually shows a distinct peak between 2 and 4 years after publication of the cited paper. However, many highly cited papers show the phenomenon of delayed recognition: their citation rate peaks many years after publication (Redner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2005</xref>). As the results in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> show, it also needs more time to be mentioned in a policy document, because the period of origin of the policy documents is much longer than that of a typical scientific paper (see e.g. the 
 <italic class="italic">IPCC Reports</italic> which appear only every 6–7 years, whereas a typical scientific paper arises within 1 year). This corresponds to the maximum of the difference between the percentages around 2005–2006 in the right column of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>.
