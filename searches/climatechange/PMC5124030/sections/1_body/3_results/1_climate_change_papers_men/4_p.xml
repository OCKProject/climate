<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> shows the number of CCP and number of CCP_P broken down by the journals in which the papers had appeared. Not surprisingly, the prominent journals 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic> are comparatively often mentioned by policy documents. Their multidisciplinary orientation and the more general character of many papers published by them is a decisive advantage for being considered and mentioned comparatively frequently. In contrast, the journal 
 <italic class="italic">Geophysical Research Letters</italic> at the top of Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> is far more subject-specific (concerning climate change). The journal publishes many more policy-relevant papers in general (19.3 % among CCP_P) than one can expect (9.1 % among CCP). This corresponds to the publication output in terms of the total number of climate change related papers published and the large proportion of highly cited papers (Haunschild et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>). Both facts may increase the probability of being mentioned in a policy document, too.
