<p class="p">As Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> shows, papers published in 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic> benefit from these prestigious and most visible journals and the more general character of their papers: Five of the nine CCP_P with the most mentions (at least ten) in policy documents have been published in these journals. The topics of the papers most frequently mentioned in policy documents are more notable: Eight out of nine papers are about adaptation and vulnerability of climate change and deal with agriculture (crop production, food security) and fishery (one paper discusses emission scenarios of greenhouse gases). Thus, the papers have the more practical consequences of climate change for society as a topic. Since the results of Haunschild et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>) show that the share of the publication output of climate change papers assigned to agriculture is rather low (about 9 % of the overall climate change literature), policy documents seem to focus on a part of the climate change literature which is especially interesting in the political context—the welfare of the population.
