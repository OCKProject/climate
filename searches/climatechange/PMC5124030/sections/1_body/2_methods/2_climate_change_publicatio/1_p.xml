<p class="p">In 2015, we have constructed a set of 222,060 papers (articles and reviews only) on climate change (also referred to as climate change papers, CCP, in the following) published between 1980 and 2014 via a sophisticated search method called “interactive query formulation”. A detailed explanation of the procedure can be found in Haunschild, Bornmann, and Marx (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2016</xref>). We used the dataset to study (1) the growth of the overall publication output on climate change as well as (2) of the major subfields, and (3) the contributing journals and countries as well as their citation impact. (4) Furthermore, we illustrated the time evolution and relative importance of specific research topics on the basis of a title word analysis.
