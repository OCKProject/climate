<p class="p">Our Web of Science (WoS) in-house database—derived from the Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-E), Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI), and Arts and Humanities Citation Index (AHCI) provided by Thomson Reuters (Philadelphia, USA)—has DOIs for 149,657 of the 222,060 papers. We tried to obtain the DOIs for the remaining 72,403 papers from CrossRef using the Perl module Bib::CrossRef.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> The API returned a DOI for each paper. Therefore, we checked if the publication year, journal title, and issue agree with the information in our in-house database. For 42.5 % (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30,784) of the cases, the bibliographic information disagreed and the papers were discarded. Using this procedure, we obtained 41,619 additional DOIs from the climate change publication set.
