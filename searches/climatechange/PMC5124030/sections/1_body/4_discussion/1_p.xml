<p class="p">In recent years, societal impact measurements of academic research have become more and more important. This trend is not only visible by their consideration in national evaluation systems (e.g. the REF), but also in the commercial success of providers delivering altmetrics data (e.g. Altmetric). Currently, the most important and most frequently used method of societal impact measurement is the case study approach in which cases of research are described leading successfully to a specific form of societal impact (King’s College London and Digital Science

However, case studies have the disadvantages that they are expensive, the results are biased towards success stories, and the results for different entities (e.g. universities) are not comparable. Based on the results of case studies, it is not possible to say that one entity is more successful in generating societal impact than another entity. Such comparisons are only possible by using quantitative indicators with a large coverage of research entities: “The advantage of using quantitative indicators is that they can be standardized and aggregated, allowing universities to use them on a continuous basis to track their impact, compare it with other universities, and recognise the contribution of every faculty member, of whatever scale” (Ovseiko et al.
