<p class="p">In this study, we used a comprehensive dataset of papers on climate change to investigate mentions of papers in policy documents. Climate change is particularly useful in this respect because the topic is very policy-relevant since many years. Thus, we expected to find a large number of papers mentioned in policy documents in comparison with other research fields—especially because corresponding policy sites are continuously evaluated by Altmetric. However, the results of the analyses could not validate our expectation: Of 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 191,276 publications on climate change in the dataset, only 1.2 % (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2341) have at least one policy mention. The rate of 1.2 % is also small in comparison with the result of Kousha and Thelwall (in press) who show that “within Biomedical Engineering, Biotechnology, and Pharmacology &amp; Pharmaceutics, 7–10 % of Scopus articles had at least one patent citation”. The result of this study contradicts the claim of Khazragui and Hudson (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2015</xref>) that “it is rare that a single piece of research has a decisive influence on policy. Rather policy tends to be based upon a large body of work constituting ‘the commons’” (p. 55). The low percentage of 1.2 % which we found in this study might be due to the fact that Altmetric quite recently started to analyze policy documents and the coverage of the literature is still low (but will be extended). However, the low percentage might also reflect that only a small part of the literature is really policy-relevant and most of the papers are only relevant for researchers studying climate change. Two other reasons for the low percentage might be that (1) policy documents may not mention every important paper on which a policy document is based on. (2) There are possible barriers and low interaction levels between researchers and policy makers.
