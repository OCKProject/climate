<p class="p">This study is a first attempt to analyze mentions of scientific publications in policy documents. We encourage that further empirical studies follow because the data source is of special interest in the use of altmetrics data for measuring the broader impact of research. It will be interesting to see whether more papers are used in policy documents in upcoming years (because of the wider coverage of the policy literature by Altmetric). Furthermore, it would be interesting to generate results from other areas of research (which are also particularly interesting for the policy area) in order to compare the results for climate change with the results for other areas. For example, it will be interesting to see whether there are higher or lower percentages than 1.2Â % of publications mentioned in policy documents (see above). Do policy documents from other areas focus on more recent literature than policy documents on climate change do? When the coverage of research papers in policy documents will be on a significantly higher level, future studies should also try to normalize policy document mentions. This study has already demonstrated that mentions in policy documents are time-dependent and we can expect that policy documents will differently focus on certain areas of research. Thus, time- and area-specific forms of normalization will be necessary if entities (e.g. research groups or institutions) with broad outputs in times and areas are evaluated.</p>
