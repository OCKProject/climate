<p class="p">In conclusion, we would like to mention limitations of this study. The first one refers to the documents analyzed by Altmetric: Altmetric does not only analyze documents from governments, but also documents from researchers who summarize the status of research on a certain topic for politicians as potential readers. Bornmann and Marx (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2014</xref>) proposed that the former document type can be named as assessment report: Assessment reports summarize the status of research on a certain subject in form of narrative reviews or meta-analyses. However, assessment reports are preliminary stages of impact on politics, because they summarize the literature with the goal of increasing the impact of research on politics. Real impact on politics can only be measured by analyzing documents from governments. A second limitation of this study is the problem of disambiguating policy documents in different and same languages. Some policy documents have the same content while only the language differs. In these cases, the mentions are counted multiple times.
