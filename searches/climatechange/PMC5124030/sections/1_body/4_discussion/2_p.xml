<p class="p">Whereas bibliometric indicators have emerged as the most important metrics to measure the recursive impact of research, the development of metrics for the measurement of societal impact is challenging. According to the US National Research Council (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2014</xref>) “no high-quality metrics for measuring societal impact currently exist that are adequate for evaluating the impacts of federally funded research on a national scale … Each metric describes but a part of the larger picture, and even collectively, they fail to reveal the larger picture. Moreover, few if any metrics can accurately measure important intangibles, such as the knowledge generated by research and research training” (p. 70). In Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>, we refer to Wilsdon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>) who highlight only two quantitative indicators which can be used for the societal impact measurement: Google patent citations (for measuring innovation in industry) and clinical guideline citations (for measuring the impact of biomedical research on clinical practice). However, further indicators are necessary which allow targeting the three institutional foundations of impact: (1) epistemological (better understanding of phenomena behind different kinds of societal problems), (2) artefactual (development of technological artefacts and instruments), and (3) interactional (organizational forms of partnerships between researchers and different kinds of societal actors) (Miettinen et al.
