<p class="p">This study focusses on a relatively new form of impact measurement (provided by Altmetric), which could complement Google patent citations and clinical guideline citations: mentions of publications in policy documents. It is an interesting form of impact measurement compared to other altmetrics (e.g. mentions in tweets and blogs) because (1) it is target-oriented (i.e. it measures the impact on a specific sector of society) and (2) it focusses on a relevant part of society for research—the policy area. Many research topics are policy-relevant (e.g. health care or labor market research) and it is interesting to know in the context of wider impact evaluations which (kind of) publications have more or less impact. Altmetric and Scholastica (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2015</xref>) exemplify that policy document mentions cannot only be used on the institutional level to demonstrate impact, but also on the level of single researchers. They describe the case of a university professor who would like to show the broader impact of her research to the National Institutes of Health (Bethesda, MD; USA) and the Medical Research Council’s (London UK) program officers: “Altmetrics were able to show her that her work had been referenced in policy documents published by two major organizations—evidence she considered ‘bona fide data demonstrating that practitioners—not researchers—but folks who can affect lives through legislation, health care, and education, are using my research to better their work’” (p. 26).
