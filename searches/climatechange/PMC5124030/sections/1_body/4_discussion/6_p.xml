<p class="p">In order to find out which kind of papers are more or less interesting in the policy context (e.g. articles or reviews), we compared the distribution of papers among CCP and CCP_P. The results show that the policy literature tends to cite research which has been published a longer time ago than researchers do in their papers. Thus, research papers seem to need more time to produce impact on politics than on research itself. As expected, reviews are overrepresented among CCP_P: the observed CCP_P value is higher than the expected value delivered by the CCP distribution. Reviews summarize the results of many primary research papers and connect research lines from different research groups. Good reviews save the labor of reviewing the literature on one’s own responsibility. In this study, we further revealed that papers published in 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic> as well from the areas “Earth and related environmental sciences” and “Social and economic geography” are especially relevant in the policy context.
