<p class="p">The low number of mentions in policy documents further raises the question what mentions in policy-related documents really measure: Is it relevance of academic papers? Do the mentions reflect the effort of researchers to interact with policy makers, an ongoing relationship between researchers and policy makers, or the effort of the policy organization to include (climate change) research in policy documents? Future studies should try to find an answer to these questions by undertaking (1) analyses of the context of paper mentions in policy-related documents or (2) surveys of the authors of these documents asking for the motivations for the paper mentions. Independent of these and other possible results of forthcoming studies, one should keep in mind that non-mentioned papers are not necessarily less relevant than mentioned papers; they may simply be unknown to policy makers.</p>
