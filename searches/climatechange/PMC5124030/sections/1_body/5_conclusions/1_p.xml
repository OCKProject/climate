<p class="p">Bibliometrics is particularly successful in measuring impact, because the target of impact measurement is clearly defined: the publishing researcher who is working in the science system. Thus, citation counts provide target-oriented metrics (Lähteenmäki-Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, many societal impact measurement studies are intended to measure impact in a broad sense whereas broad means the impact on all areas of society (or at least as many as possible). This is especially the case for studies which are based on various sources of altmetrics. Furthermore, there is the tendency in altmetrics to use different altmetrics sources for the calculation of a composite indicator. Composite indicators are calculated because many altmetrics sources are characterized by low counts. For example, Altmetric has proposed the Altmetric Attention Score, which summarizes the impact of a piece of research over different altmetrics sources (e.g. blog posts and tweets) (
