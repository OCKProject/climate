 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2015</xref>) give some examples here: “For example, someone publishing a study on water use in Africa may be particularly keen to see that many of those tweeting and sharing the work are based in that region, whereas economics scholars might want to keep track of where their work is being referenced in public policy or by leading think-tanks” (p. 24). Thus, we appreciate those quantitative approaches which analyse scholarly paper citations, clinical guideline citations, policy document mentions, or patent citations. Without the restriction of impact to specific target groups (identifiable recipients) it is not clear which kind of impact is actually measured. The general uncertainty in scientometrics about the meaning of altmetrics is probably based on the tendency to use composite indicators or counts without target-restrictions when altmetrics are applied.
