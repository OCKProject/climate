<p class="p">Policy documents are one of the few altmetrics sources which can be used for the target-oriented impact measurement. As source for the measurement of impact on politics, policy documents are one of the most interesting altmetrics sources which should be studied in more detail in future studies. For the use of a metric based on policy document mentions in these studies, we deem it as very necessary that Altmetric publishes an up-to-date list of the sources with policy-related documents which they continuously analyze. Without this information it is scarcely possible to interpret the results of a study which is based on mentions in policy-related documents. On the current homepage, Altmetric only lists some examples of the type of organizations included in the database (Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>). Many national sources of policy documents, such as ministries or regional governments, are not mentioned in the list. Are these sources not included in the Altmetric database? We suggest to list in detail the types of policy making bodies included in the database and the number of organizations per type (perhaps with examples). This gives the user an idea of the inclusiveness of the database and thereby allows them to make a more informed assessment of the results of the analysis. If the typology would also contain the total number of papers mentioned, it could show which type of policy making bodies already cooperate closely with researchers.
