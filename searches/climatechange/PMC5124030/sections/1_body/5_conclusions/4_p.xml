<p class="p">Taken as a whole, many questions should be answered until one can decide whether this new altmetrics source can be used in practice, i.e. in the evaluation practice of the REF, ERA or others. Currently, there are too many open questions which disregard the new source as a metric for a prompt consideration. The user of the new data source and recipient of corresponding results should always keep in mind that the analysis is of quantitative nature; counting the number of mentions of a paper set in policy documents. It is not a qualitative analysis of how the research described in the paper set is being discussed in policy documents. This information could only be retrieved when the context of mentions in policy documents is analyzed (Bornmann and Daniel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>). Furthermore, the analysis of mentions in policy-related documents cannot uncover the different forms of interactions between science and policy. In Sect.Â 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec" class="xref">2</xref>, we described two typologies which have been developed to describe these forms. The quantitative analysis of mentions in policy-related documents treats the mentioned scientist as a 
 <italic class="italic">pure scientist</italic> who is oriented towards facts and is actually not interested on the interaction with political actors (Pielke, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2007</xref>). The interaction is reduced to the reading of papers (which are oriented to academic audiences) by political actors who deemed the papers as so important that they mention them in the policy-related document.
