<p class="p">In this study, we deal with a relatively new form of societal impact measurements. Recently, Altmetric—a start-up providing publication level metrics (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>) in order to uncover the interaction between science and politics. On the one side, governments allocate very large amounts of public money to various units (e.g. researchers or institutions) for various forms of research. In many countries, the public money is distributed by the soft money system in which researchers formulate proposals for projects and funding bodies decide on their acceptance or rejection. For governments, academic science is one section of a vague defined Research &amp; Development system which ranges from basic science to near-market technological development (Ziman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2000</xref>). On the other side, independent and still active scientists advice stakeholders in the policy area: “The scientific community is increasingly being called upon to provide evidence and advice to government policy-makers across a range of issues, from short-term public health emergencies through to longer-term challenges, such as population ageing or climate change” (OECD 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>, p. 5). The scientific advice can be made in direct face-to-face interactions or in indirect interactions whereby papers written by scientists (actually written for their colleagues) are read by political actors and mentioned in policy-related documents. The latter type of interaction can possibly be measured by the new data source offered by Altmetric.
