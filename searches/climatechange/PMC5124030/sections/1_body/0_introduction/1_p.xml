<p class="p">Academic science emerged at the beginning of the 19th century (Ziman, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">1996</xref>). During academic science, the evaluation of scientific results focuses on their excellence and originality in a self-regulated process—the peer review process (Bornmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2011</xref>; Petit 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2004</xref>). The post-academic science which begins in the 1980s (Ziman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2000</xref>) is characterized by an increasing competition for research funds (national and international) which are mostly project-dependent distributed. Applicants of project proposals are more and more forced to be specific about the expected outcome and its wider economic and societal impact (Ziman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">1998</xref>): The context of application becomes the interesting topic which decides on funding (besides excellence and originality). The objective of post-academic science “is not scientific excellence and theory-building as such but rather the production of a result that is relevant and applicable for the users of the research; in other words, the result should be socially relevant, socially robust and innovative” (Erno-Kjolhede and Hansson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2011</xref>, p. 134). The new objective also leads to changes in the ex-post evaluation of science. During the 1990s researchers started to develop evaluation systems with possible indicators in order to measure the societal impact of research (Miettinen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2015</xref>). Also, governments and intermediaries (government-funded granting agencies) started requiring that applicants delineate their broader impact plans (Dance 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>). In the current UK Research Excellence Framework (REF), and the Excellence in Research for Australia (ERA) societal impact measurements are inherent parts of the national evaluation systems.
