<p class="p">How is societal impact defined? A pointedly definition has been published by Wilsdon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2015</xref>): “Research has a societal impact when auditable or recorded influence is achieved upon non-academic organisation(s) or actor(s) in a sector outside the university sector itself—for instance, by being used by one or more business corporations, government bodies, civil society organisations, media or specialist/professional media organisations or in public debate. As is the case with academic impacts, societal impacts need to be demonstrated rather than assumed. Evidence of external impacts can take the form of references to, citations of or discussion of a person, their work or research results” (p. 6). Samuel and Derrick (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2015</xref>) interviewed evaluators working in the REF and asked for their definition of societal impact. The interviewees defined societal impact as ‘outcome’ from research which makes a change or difference (e.g. a change to clinical practice or patient care) or which creates economic benefits (e.g. creating jobs).
