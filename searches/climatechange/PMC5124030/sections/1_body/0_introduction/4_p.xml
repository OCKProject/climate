<p class="p">We regard the new data source as an interesting possibility to specifically measure the (societal) impact of research on policy-related areas which should be empirically investigated. Using a comprehensive dataset with publications on climate change as an example, we study the usefulness of the new data source for impact measurement. As publication set in this study, we used climate change literature because (1) corresponding policy sites are continuously analyzed by Altmetric. (2) We expect to observe many references to the scientific literature in the policy documents (Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2014</xref>) because climate change is a policy relevant topic since many years. We are especially interested in the characteristics of the papers which are mentioned in the policy documents: Are these papers published in certain journals (e.g. popular journals like 
 <italic class="italic">Nature</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Science</italic>), in certain publication years (e.g. more recent years), or with certain document types (e.g. reviews)?
