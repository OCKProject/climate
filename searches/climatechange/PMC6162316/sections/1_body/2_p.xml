<p id="Par3" class="p">Our final concern regards the very weak effect size of year. Specifically, there is a weak variation of the mean of Fulton’s condition factor across years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Even after removing the quadratic term, the slope of the linear regression conducted on either the annual means of condition factor or on the individual fish is −0.002. Such a modest decline across years suggests that this change is not biologically significant, potentially due to greater within-year variation in the condition factor than among years. In fact, when fitting a linear mixed model to the entire data set (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 1136) and treating the year as a random effect, we observe higher within-year variability (

 <sub class="sub">residual</sub> = 0.116, 95% CI: [0.111, 0.121]) than the variability among years (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">year</sub> = 0.032, 95% CI: [0.018, 0.057]). Therefore, even if statistical significance had been observed (which we contend it was not), such a weak effect of year is likely an example of a statistically significant result where the effect size is not biologically significant
