 </sup> reported on a long-term study of the ecological impacts of climate change in the world’s largest high Arctic lake: Lake Hazen on Canada’s Ellesmere Island. The paper made a convincing case that climate change has had a dramatic and significant impact on the watershed of this important freshwater ecosystem. Some of these changes have clearly impacted the ecology of Lake Hazen. We disagree, however, with the conclusion that such ecological changes have resulted in a significant decline in the condition of Arctic Char (

It is critical to examine the evidence for changes in the condition of Arctic Char given the importance of this species to communities throughout Canada’s Arctic as a valued food resource and because changes to condition could impact its management.
