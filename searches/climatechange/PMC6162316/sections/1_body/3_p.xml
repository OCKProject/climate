  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup> (note however that the individuals studied in Lake Hazen are not anadromous). We conclude that the available evidence does not currently support the conclusion of a decline in condition factor of Arctic Char in Lake Hazen. Consequently, sounding the alarm on impacts related to climate-change on Arctic Char in northern Canada is premature. Continued monitoring of Arctic Char coupled with appropriate sampling designs and statistical analyses is, however, central to the effective management of this vital resource.
