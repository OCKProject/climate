 <p class="p">The climate change scenarios were prepared by the Wegener Center at the University of Graz in the EU-funded project ACQWA (assessing climate impacts on the quantity and quality of water), funded within the 7th Framework Program of the European Union (grant agreement no 212250). The ENSEMBLES data used in ACQWA was obtained from the EU FP6 Integrated Project ENSEMBLES (contract number 505539). Meteorological data was obtained from MeteoSwiss and Agrometeo. Phenological data were provided by Agroscope Viticulture Research Centre at Pully, whose support is greatly acknowledged.</p>
