<p id="Par6" class="p">The aim of the present study was to assess future changes in frost risks in grapevine based on ten regional climate change projections for the lower Swiss Rhone Valley derived from GCM–RCM chains of the EU FP7 ENSEMBLES project, all of them assuming the SRES A1B emission scenario (Gobiet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2014</xref>) as applied in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4). While recent research focuses on RCP scenarios in combination with the more complex climate models, as used in IPCC AR5, Knutti and Sedláček (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2013</xref>) have shown that projected temperature changes as computed by the new models are remarkably similar to the projections our study is based on. Additionally, we account for climate model uncertainty by applying ten different GCM-RCM chains. Regarding the climate change projections, we specifically focused on the two major wine-growing areas around Aigle and Sion with slightly different current climates, and on the variety ‘Chasselas’ as this region’s main white vine variety. We developed a phenology model to simulate budburst and used the model to quantify the shift in the timing of BBCH09 between the reference period 1961–1990 and a future period between 2021 and 2050. Using the same climate information, changes in three different frost indices were calculated and related to the corresponding timing of budburst.
