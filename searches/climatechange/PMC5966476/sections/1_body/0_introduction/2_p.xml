<p id="Par3" class="p">For frost damage to occur, the timing of early phenological plant development in relation to the occurrence of low-temperature events is crucial. After spring de-acclimation, most sensitive stages of grapevine development are around budburst. As both climatological frost conditions and grapevine phenology are related to the seasonal development of temperature, they are subject to long-term changing climatic conditions. Thus, in the future, the risk for frost damage depends not only mainly on the change in the frequency and occurrence of frost days but also on the shifting phenology of grapevines. Rigby and Porporato (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2008</xref>) showed that increasing daily temperatures (i.e., a positive temperature trend) lead to a decrease in spring frost risk, while an increasing temperature variance increases the risk. However, according to Webb et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2012</xref>), the same climate change projection may have different effects on plant phenology in different regions. In their study in Australia, they found earlier ripening for grapevines in nine of ten regions, while ripening in one region was delayed. Thus, the future risk of frost damage to grapevines depends on the magnitude of the change in regional climate, production region, and variety.
