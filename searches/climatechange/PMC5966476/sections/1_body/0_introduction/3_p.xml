<p id="Par4" class="p">Many studies have shown that the phenology of many plant species advances due to increasing temperatures (Menzel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2006</xref>). With regard to grapevines, this advancement has been observed or modelled, for instance, in Germany (Bock et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2011</xref>), Luxembourg (Urhausen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2011</xref>), France (Jones and Davis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2000</xref>), and Australia (Webb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2012</xref>). This trend is expected to continue with rising temperatures, while at the same time, the number of frost days declines (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, these trends may not lead to a reduction in spring frost risk (Ball et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2012</xref>). An earlier start of the growing period could also lead to an increased risk of frost damage in situations where late spring frost days advance at a slower rate than the rate of the advancement of phenology (Fuhrer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>; Mosedale et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>). But it remains uncertain, which factor will dominate with regard to grapevines cultivated at different locations.
