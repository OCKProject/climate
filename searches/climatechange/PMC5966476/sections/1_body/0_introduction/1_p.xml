<p id="Par2" class="p">Late spring frost is a severe risk during early plant development. Although these events do not happen very often, they are an important threat, for instance, to wine production in the top wine regions of Europe, e.g., in France, Spain, and Italy. In Switzerland, where wine production contributed CHF 575 (5.1%) and 633 (5.6%) million to the total agricultural revenue in the years 2015 and 2016, respectively (Swiss Federal Statistical Office

In the Swiss Rhone Valley, as one of the main production regions, seven frost events were recorded since 1950, all causing severe damage to grapevines. In this inner alpine valley, 48.8 km
