 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>), two main model types are widely used to describe grapevine phenology: Forcing (F) models and chilling-and-forcing (CF) models. In F models, forcing units (FU) with respect to temperature are summed up starting at the same day every year according to a certain date or length of day (i.e., photoperiod). By fixing the start to a specific day of year (DOY), F models propose that breaking of dormancy solely depends on photoperiod and temperatures. In CF models, the starting point regarding FU accumulation is allowed to change from year to year, depending on a threshold for the accumulation of chilling units (CU). Consequently, CF models depend on winter temperature and can react to mild winters by starting FU accumulation at a later DOY, which implies that breaking of dormancy depends on both cold and warm temperatures.
