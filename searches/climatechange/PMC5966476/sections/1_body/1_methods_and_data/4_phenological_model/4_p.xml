<p id="Par70" class="p">Calibration was done with R (Version 3.1.0; R Development Core Team, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2014</xref>), using the method of simulated annealing (Bélisle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">1992</xref>) and by minimizing the squared error (SE). Since sample size was always the same for all models and fitting of parameters, minimizing standard error (SE) had the same effect as minimizing mean square error (MSE) or root mean square error (RMSE). After calibration, the different models were run with the identical validation sample to compare the goodness of fit between models. This was done by calculating the RMSE, the unbiased RMSE (RMSE′), and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Index (NSE). The best performing model was used for the following frost risk analysis.
