 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Due to the limited sample size (i.e., 88 observations), only models using six parameters or less were used. This allowed separating the sample into a calibration and a validation part of 63 (i.e., 71.6%) and 25 (i.e., 28.4%) observations, respectively. The photoperiod was calculated according to Fischer et al. (
