 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Each model chain consisted of a regional climate model (RCM), driven by a global climate model (GCM), based on the emission scenario A1B (Christensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2010</xref>; Nakicenovic and Swart 2000). The model chains were calibrated with the E-OBS gridded observational dataset with daily data for a 25 × 25 km grid (Haylock et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2008</xref>; Klein Tank et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2009</xref>). Using the quantile mapping approach (Themeßl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2010</xref>), the calibrated datasets were downscaled and error corrected for different climate stations in the Alpine region within the framework of the EU ACQWA project (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wilcke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2013</xref>). Covering a timespan from 1951 to 2050, the years 1961 to 2000 served as a calibration and validation period, leaving the years 2001 to 2050 as modelled future data (Mendlik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2011</xref>). Data for the periods 1961–1990 (reference) and 2021–2050 (CC scenario) were extracted and used in the analysis.
