<p id="Par65" class="p">For the four regressions to obtain estimates for CGI and LEY, the datasets for CGI and LEY were each split into a calibration and a validation set, consisting of 60 and 40% of the whole dataset, respectively. The partialling out was done by computing a linear regression on the whole samples of PUY and EVI, since a validation was not required. To evaluate the regressions, the statistics
