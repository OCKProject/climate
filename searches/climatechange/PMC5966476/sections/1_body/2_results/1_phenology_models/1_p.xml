<p id="Par76" class="p">Validation of the calibrated phenology models resulted in RMSE/RMSE′ values of 3 to 6 days and NSE values of 0.92 to 0.62. Models incorporating photoperiod clearly outperformed forcing models that excluded photoperiod. As an example, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows the relationship between observed and modelled DOY for BBCH09 for three F and three F.PP models. The performance of chilling-and-forcing models excluding photoperiod (i.e., CF models) and chilling-and-forcing models including photoperiod (i.e., CF.PP models) was lower (not shown). The ranking of the first six models was similar for all statistics used. In further analyses, the SF.PP model was used.
