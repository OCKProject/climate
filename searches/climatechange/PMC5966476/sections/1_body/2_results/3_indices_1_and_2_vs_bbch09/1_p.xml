<p id="Par78" class="p">The model ensemble mean for BBCH09 was compared with that of Index 1 and Index 2 to check the overlap between shifts in the critical phenological stage and in frost risk indicators. Relative to the reference period and for both locations, the advancement in BBCH09 was paralleled by an advancement in the means of both indices (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, an overlap of the distributions was only evident for Index 1, while frost according to Index 2 would always occur later than BBCH09. The overlap for Index 1 was larger for SIO than for AIG. The mean shift in Index 1 from the reference to the CC scenario period was from DOY 99 to 90 (AIG) and from DOY 103 to 95 (SIO), and was thus in same range as the shift in BBCH09 (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The mean difference between DOY for BBCH09 and for Index 1 for the reference and the CC scenario period was 12 and 15 days (AIG) and 8 and 10 days (SIO), respectively. The coefficient of variation for the difference increased between reference and CC scenario from 0.24 to 0.43 at AIG and decreased from 0.77 to 0.36 at SIO.
