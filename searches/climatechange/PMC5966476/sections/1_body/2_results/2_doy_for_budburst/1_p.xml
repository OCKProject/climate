<p id="Par77" class="p">The SF.PP model was used to calculate DOY of BBCH09 for the two locations for the reference and the CC scenario period. While all model chains projected an advancement of the DOY relative to the mean of the reference period, the plot in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> illustrates the small spread in the mean between model chains for the CC scenario period, but considerable difference in the variance. For the reference period, the mean DOY was 114 for AIG and 111 for the slightly warmer site SIO. The average of all model projections was 105 for AIG and 104 for SIO. On average, DOY for BBCH09 advanced by 9 (range 7–11) (AIG) and 7 (range 5–8) (SIO) days between the two time periods.
