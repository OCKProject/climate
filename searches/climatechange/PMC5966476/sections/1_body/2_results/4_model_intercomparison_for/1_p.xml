<p id="Par79" class="p">The difference in the timing between DOY for BBCH09 and for Index 1 was subject to the uncertainty associated with model chains (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). While the majority of model chains confirmed similar shifts for both BBCH09 and Index 1 (i.e., points located close to the 1:1 line), there are notable exceptions in both directions. Four model chains for SIO and three for AIG projected much stronger shifts in Index 1 than in DOY for BBCH09, thus indicating decreased risk of frost damage, while another set of model chains projected the opposite, particularly for SIO. For SIO, the model chain projecting the largest decrease in risk was SMHI_RCA_HadCM3Q3 (9), and the model chain projecting the largest increase in risk was ETHZ_CLM_HadCM3Q0 (7).
