<p id="Par81" class="p">A similar analysis was done for Index 3, which combines both probability and hazard by adding up daily temperature deltas below a threshold of 2 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The plot for the ensemble mean for AIG and SIO indicates only minor shifts in the probability distribution between reference and CC scenario, but some differences between sites. At AIG, a trend towards lower frequencies appeared for the CC scenario for the lower values of the Index, and the reverse was the case for the higher values. The opposite appears for SIO. This indicates that for the reference period the stronger frost events are more likely at SIO than at AIG, but could become more frequent at AIG and less frequent at SIO.
