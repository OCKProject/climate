<p id="Par80" class="p">The risk of frost damage using Index 1 was further investigated by using normalized frequency distribution plots (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This analysis confirmed that for the reference period the probability of frost to occur after budburst was projected to be larger at SIO than that at AIG. However, the plot also shows that for SIO the risk was smaller for the CC scenario period compared to the reference. At AIG, the opposite was the case, although with a very small difference in probability between the two time periods.
