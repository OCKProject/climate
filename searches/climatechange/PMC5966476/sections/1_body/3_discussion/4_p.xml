<p id="Par85" class="p">Sophisticated phenology models contain many parameters, thus sufficiently large calibration and validation samples are needed. For this reason, models with more than six parameters were not included here. Additionally, the phenology models in this study only considered daily mean temperature and some of them, daily photoperiod. The length of the photoperiod may limit the advancement of phenological development in response to increasing temperature, which is not accounted for by using only temperature in modelling the start of the potential growing season, as done in Fuhrer et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>) or Molitor et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2014</xref>). There are additional factors controlling phenology such as water availability, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and nutrients (Martínez-Lüscher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, these factors gain greater importance only in later phenological phases. It is therefore assumed that the choice of phenology models to simulate early plant development (BBCH09) was appropriate and similar models have also been used in several other studies (Basler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2016</xref>; Chuine 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2000</xref>; Nufer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>; Fila et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>). To evaluate the different phenology models, RMSE, RMSE′, and NSE were calculated. The RMSE is comparable to results by Fila et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>) who compared different phenology models for grapevine. They computed NSE ranging from 0.26 to 0.46. The NSE for the models used here ranges from 0.62 to 0.92, thus indicating even better fits. When comparing F and CF models (i.e., models solely depending on FU accumulation and models also including CU accumulation), the observations reported by Fila et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>) are confirmed: CF models do not outperform F models under present conditions. However, Fila et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>) concluded that CF models should be preferred when modelling changes in phenology due to climate change since mild winter may influence phenology in a way which cannot be represented by F models. However, Martínez-Lüscher et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2016</xref>) observed only a small response of BBCH09 in grapevines to changes in chilling temperatures. Hence, the period for predictions used in this study is most likely too short to be influenced by this effect. Additional results from ANOVA show that the choice of phenology model only contributes 4.4% to the total uncertainty, thus putting them far behind the uncertainty associated with model chains, which are responsible for 26.5% of the total uncertainty (data not shown). This is illustrated by the large variability in the change in the time difference between BBCH09 and LDF simulated with ten model chains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Although the majority of the model chains project a growing difference (i.e., declining frost damage risk), some project the opposite. Interestingly, the model chain projecting the largest decrease in risk (SMHI_RCA_HadCM3Q3) at both sites represents a relatively modest degree of warming compared to the model chain projecting the largest increase at SIO (ETHZ_CLM_HadCM3Q0) (Fuhrer et al.
