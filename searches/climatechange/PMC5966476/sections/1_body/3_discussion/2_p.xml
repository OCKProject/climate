 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2013</xref>) for the Mosel wine region in Luxembourg and Germany, respectively. However, calibrated for the grapevine variety ‘Müller-Thurgau’ and based on the SRES A1B scenario, Molitor et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2014</xref>) modelled the DOY for BBCH09 to advance by 11 days between the period 1961 to 1990 and 2059 to 2098, but the DOY of the last day of frost (

They calculated the frequency of frost days during a 60-day period starting with BBCH09 to decrease from, on average, 0.137 to 0.082 events per year between the period 1961 to 1990 and the period 2021 to 2050. Similar studies exploring frost risk changes for other fruit trees produced results that are broadly in line with the findings from this study. For example, Di Lena et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2017</xref>) suggest that the risk of spring frost damage for almonds grown in Central Italy is likely to remain unchanged in the future. Eccel et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2009</xref>) suggest a constant or reduced risk of spring frost damage for apples in Northern Italy. Also, Hoffmann and Rath (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>) project that blossom frost risk is unlikely to increase until the end of the century for apple trees in the northern regions of Germany. A recent study by Vitasse et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2018</xref>) confirmed that spring frost risk to fruit and forest trees has remained unchanged at lower elevations in Switzerland, while it has significantly increased at higher elevations over the last few decades—likely due to an insignificant change in the occurrence of the latest spring frost event at higher elevations. A slow decrease and unchanged spring frost risk was also identified for cherries grown at two sites in Germany (Chmielewski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2017</xref>). Our projections and those of Molitor et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2014</xref>) are not in line with those of the study published by Mosedale et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2015</xref>) who projected for southwest England the DOY for BBCH09 to advance by 45 days by the year 2080 under the SRES A1B scenario. This large shift led to an increase in the probability for a frost day (

The discrepancy between results from studies at different locations underlines that the change in frost risk depends on location, but may also be affected by the choice of the phenology model, specifically consideration of effects of photoperiod on the potential phenological advancement under climate change.
