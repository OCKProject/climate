<p id="Par82" class="p">The results for the two selected locations in an important wine production region of Switzerland confirm the generally projected advancement of the timing of budburst with climate change. The ensemble mean shift in DOY for BBCH09 between the reference and the CC scenario period is 7 to 9 days. This shift seems reasonable, although it is at the lower end of the range proposed by Fila et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>) who projected BBCH09 to advance between 14 and 44 days during the period 1990 to 2090. However, our projections only cover the time until 2050. Most likely, the shift in the DOY for BBCH09 would continue towards earlier dates, if the applied temperature projection would cover a longer time period. However, the climate model projection uncertainty would also increase substantially for further time horizons. It is assumed here that for frost damage to occur, critical temperatures are required during a 100-day period after budburst. For the 30-year reference period, the probability for frost damage based on Index 1 is around 17% for SIO and only 2% for AIG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). For the years 1950–2015, six events of frost damage in the Swiss Rhone Valley are documented, which occurred in the years 1957, 1974, 1991, 1995, 1997, and 2012 (Favre and Balleys 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>), which is broadly in agreement with the probability calculated for SIO. For the CC scenario, the last frost day (Index 1) advances by 8 and 9 days between the two periods, and is thus similar to the shift in BBCH09 for the two locations. The difference between the time of the last day of frost and BBCH09 is much larger for AIG than for SIO, both for the reference and the CC scenario periods, thus indicating a larger risk for frost to occur at SIO. This is in agreement with the larger number of frost days at this site during the 1981–2010 period (

The variability (i.e., coefficient of variation) regarding the mean difference between DOY for BBCH09 and DOY of the last frost day, however, increases at AIG and decreases at SIO. Rigby and Porporato (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2008</xref>) observed an increase in variability with climate change and concluded that the risk for spring frost damage would increase. Hence, our result suggests a higher but decreasing risk of frost damage with climate change at SIO and a lower but increasing risk at AIG. This conclusion is supported by the probability analysis in Fig.
