<p id="Par84" class="p">There are several uncertainties associated with the results of our simulations. These concern mainly (a) the temperature reconstruction, (b) the phenology model, and (c) the CC model chains. The applied method to reconstruct daily mean temperature at CGI and LEY is straight forward: mean temperatures from one, respectively two other meteorological station serve as independent variables, after correction for their correlation (i.e. partialling out). However, the method is much less sophisticated than the method applied by Frei (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2014</xref>), which considers the non-linear profile of the vertical temperature curve as well as non-Euclidean distances, considering hills and valleys. Still, the goodness of fit according to RMSE is reasonable. While here the RMSE ranges from 0.5 to 0.8 °C, in the applied cross-validation for the entire Swiss Alpine Region, Frei (
