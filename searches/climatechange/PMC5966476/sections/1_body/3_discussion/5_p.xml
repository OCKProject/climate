<p id="Par86" class="p">In conclusion, the present analysis combining a calibrated phenology model with an ensemble of downscaled climate projections suggests that, in the near future, late spring frost risk in grapevine may either increase or decrease, depending on location and climate model chain. While for the current climate, the risk for frost damage is larger at the warmer site (SIO) compared to that at the cooler site (AIG); for the period 2021–2050, small shifts in both phenology and occurrence of frost (i.e., days with

However, there are considerable uncertainties related to climate model chains and, consequently, in projected shifts in frost risk. Thus, our results strongly support the use of larger multimodel ensembles when evaluating future climate risks in agriculture.
