 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>) and migration northward from the present to 2080 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig.Â 3E</xref>). From the LIG to the LGM, the expansion occurred mainly in the Sichuan Basin, with a source population from the most southeastern regions of China migrating northwest (
