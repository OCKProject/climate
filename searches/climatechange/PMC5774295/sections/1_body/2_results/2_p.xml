<p class="p">It is noteworthy that the predicted area based on the MTSS threshold is very similar to that based on the 10% TP threshold (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">1D</xref>). The high similarity implies a consistence in the trend of distributional change over time between the predictions based on the two types of thresholds. Therefore, investigation of the predicted areas was based on binary ENMs generated by MTSS and 10% TP thresholds; however, assessment of the dynamic change of distribution over time was based only on the chosen MTSS threshold. Besides, compared to the present distribution of

Given the consistent trend of change and the focus of this study to explore the distributional change and potential migration routes of species, for conciseness, we choose one of the four future prediction for elaboration below: the prediction based on the HadCM3 simulation under SRES A1B.
