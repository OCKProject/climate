<p class="p">The observed AUC values of 0.9802 (training data) and 0.9744 (testing data) indicate a good discrimination of the models between absence and presence cells, and the relatively high AUC values suggest that the species distributions were well predicted by climate. The MTSS and 10% TP thresholds were calculated to be 0.3048 and 0.3842, respectively.</p>
