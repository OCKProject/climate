<p class="p">The current potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> involves three main disjunct districts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>): southeast China, where the actual population exists; and the southern frontier regions of Japan and the Korean peninsula, where extant populations are absent. The ENM projections for the other three periods (LIG, LGM and 2080) depict potential distributions with altered locations. The modelled potential climate suitability during the LIG shows four main disjunct regions, including southeast China, the southern frontier regions of the Himalayas and the southern frontier regions of Japan and the Korean Peninsula (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>). During the LGM, fragmented distribution in southeast China is revealed (
