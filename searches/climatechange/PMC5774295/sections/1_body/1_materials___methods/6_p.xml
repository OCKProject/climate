<p class="p">We chose area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) to assess the predictive performance of the ENMs (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fielding &amp; Bell, 1997</xref>). The AUC statistic is bounded from 0.5 to 1.0, in which 0.5 indicates a random prediction (useless model) and 1.0 a perfect model prediction of presence versus absence; the closer AUC is to 1, the better the predictive accuracy of the model. Each model was run 10 times, with 75% of the species occurrence data selected for model training and 25% for model testing. To obtain binary predictions of the climate suitability of ENMs, MaxEnt’s logistic probability of occurrence output was converted to a binary mode (presence-absence output) using the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity logistic (MTSS) threshold and the 10 percentile training presence logistic (10% TP) threshold. By maximizing the proportions of actual positives and negatives that are correctly identified, prediction based on the MTSS threshold represents the most accurate forecast of presence/absence (
