<p class="p">To determine the variable with greatest influence for the model prediction in each grid cell, we performed limiting factor analysis. For any given point, the limiting factor is the variable with a value change at that point that results in the greatest change in the predicted probability of species occurrence (

The algorithm for the limiting factor analysis was programmed into MaxEnt, and the ‘density.tools.LimitingFactor’ command was used.
