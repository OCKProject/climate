<p class="p">To explore the distributional change between the two ENMs during each climate transition (e.g., from the LIG to the LGM, from the LGM to the current period, and from the present to 2080), we reduced the distribution to a single central point (known as a centroid) and created a vector depicting the magnitude and direction of the predicted change. Furthermore, to reveal potential migration in detail, we applied migration vector analysis. First, we calculated the geographic centroids of the ranges for every 60 × 60 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for each period and then determined the centroid in the second time interval nearest to the centroid in the first time interval (i.e., LGM to LIG, present to LGM, and future to present); finally, we evaluated the potential migration from one period to the next.
