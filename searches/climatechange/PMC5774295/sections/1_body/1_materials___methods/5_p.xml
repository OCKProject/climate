<p class="p">ENMs assume that species are in equilibrium with their environments (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guisan &amp; Zimmermann, 2000</xref>), i.e., species occur in all climatically suitable regions while being absent from all unsuitable ones (
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hutchinson, 1957</xref>). In the process of investigating species occurrence data, however, some areas in a landscape were sampled more intensively than others; this sampling bias will lead to a lack of equilibrium of species distributions with climate. To reduce the effect of sampling bias, the approach of spatial filtering of a species occurrence dataset was applied in this study (
 <xref rid="ref-9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boria et al., 2014</xref>). We spatially filtered the distribution data of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> to obtain the maximum number of localities 10 km apart. As a result, 49 occurrence localities (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-7" class="xref">Table S2</xref>) were rarefied to 47 points (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-8" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). To minimize the effect of sampling bias, we also used a bias file representing a Gaussian kernel density of the species occurrence localities sampled within a 60-km search radius. The bias file upweights presence-only data points with fewer neighbours in a geographic space (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al., 2011</xref>). The species occurrence data and climate layers were both projected to the Asia north equidistant conic projection in ArcMap.
