<p class="p">Future climate data were provided by the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) (available at 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccafs-climate.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ccafs-climate.org</ext-link>). These climate data were generated by GCMs under a set of emissions scenarios. By the end of 2012, the closest emissions scenarios resulting from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) process to the observed emission trends were the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) A1B used in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5 used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (

For this study, we chose four types of future (2080) climate layers generated from simulations using a set of GCMs under the above two emission scenarios: UK Meteorological Office (UKMO) Hadley Centre Coupled Model, version 3 (HadCM3) (

 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al., 2011</xref>), under RCP 8.5; Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis (CCCma) third-generation Coupled Global Climate Model with T63 spectral resolution (CGCM3.1-T63) (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Flato, 2005</xref>), under SRES A1B; and Meteorological Research Institute (MRI) Coupled Global Climate Model, version 3 (CGCM3) (
