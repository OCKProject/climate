<p class="p">Currently, this species is ranked as at least ‘Vulnerable B2ab (iii, v) ver. 3.1’ and possibly the more threatened category ‘Endangered’ in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List of Threatened Species (
 <xref rid="ref-114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang &amp; Christian, 2013</xref>). Its population is severely fragmented, and the quality of the habitat and the population size continue to decline (

 <xref rid="ref-114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yang &amp; Christian, 2013</xref>). Compared to its current distribution, the extensive distribution of this species across the Northern Hemisphere was much wider during geological time (from the Cretaceous to the P1io-P1eistocene) (

 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> has kept up with and survived past changes in climate. However, whether the ‘living fossil’ 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> can cope with the challenge presented by the unprecedentedly rapid climate warming of the 21st century is a matter of concern. In addition, mast seeding—the synchronous intermittent production of large seed crops by populations (
