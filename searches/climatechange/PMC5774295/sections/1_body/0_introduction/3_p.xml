<p class="p">As human activity intensifies, global temperatures are expected to rise by 1.1–6.4 °C during the 21st century (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2007</xref>). Due to this unprecedentedly rapid rate of warming, climate change is predicted to be the greatest force in reshaping the geographical distribution of species in the 21st century (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leadley et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, given the rapidity of climate change over the coming decades, whether populations can shift rapidly enough successfully tracking climate change is the central concern of many ecology studies (

 <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meyers &amp; Bull, 2002</xref>), some species are unable to disperse or adapt fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate, leading to increased extinction risk (

 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menéndez et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, landscape modifications resulting from the intensification of human activity may aggravate the negative effects of climate change by impeding species migration. Consequently, there is great concern about the challenges posed to extant species by the ongoing unprecedented change (
