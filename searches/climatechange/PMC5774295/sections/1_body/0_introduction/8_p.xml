<p class="p">Niche conservatism is a key assumption underlying the application of ENMs. In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>, the evolutionary history indicates evolutionary stasis for this species since at least the Eocene (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">LePage &amp; Basinger, 1995</xref>). As 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> is an extraordinary example of evolutionary stasis, its niche is considered to be evolutionarily conservative because evolutionary stasis is perceived as related to niche conservatism (

 <xref rid="ref-104" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stigall, 2012</xref>). The inference of niche conservatism for 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> is supported by the general consistency of its temperature requirement throughout geological time (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bai &amp; Li, 2017</xref>). In addition, this concern can be somewhat alleviated by the fact that a very general pattern of niche conservatism among species has been rather broadly confirmed in a recent review (
