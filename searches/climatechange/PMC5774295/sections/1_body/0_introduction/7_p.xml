<p class="p">Reconstructing the range dynamics of species under past climate fluctuations is helpful for revealing their response mechanism to climate change. Clarification of a species’ response mechanism in combination with future distribution prediction can assist in developing effective conservation strategies (

 <xref rid="ref-92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>). Such climate envelope models are important for revealing the past response of organisms to climate change, particularly for periods for which there is no fossil record. Overall, this tool has been regarded as an effective approach for reliably assessing the potential effects of future climate change on the fate of organisms (e.g.,
