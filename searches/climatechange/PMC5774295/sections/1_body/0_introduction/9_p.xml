<p class="p">In this study, we use an ENM to model the range dynamics of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> across four temporal frameworks representing four extreme moments of climatic variability during the Quaternary: the LIG, the LGM, the present and the future (2080). Our overall aim is to hind-cast the response of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> to chronological climate change and ultimately to provide some meaningful information about future conservation strategies for this vulnerable species based on the hind-casted response mechanism to climate change and the future distribution prediction.
