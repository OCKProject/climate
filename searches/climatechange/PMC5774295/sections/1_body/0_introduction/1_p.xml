 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnosky et al., 2011</xref>). Effective conservation planning is necessary to avoid potential biodiversity loss, and an understanding of the distribution dynamics of organisms in response to climate change underlies the development of effective conservation strategies (
