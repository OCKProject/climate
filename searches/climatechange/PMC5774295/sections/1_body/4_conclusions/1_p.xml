<p class="p">In summary, in common with the general responses of species to climate change but with individual pattern, 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> responds to glacial-interglacial cycles with high sensitivity, supporting the view that restricted-range species are sensitive to climate change (
 <xref rid="ref-103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sandel et al., 2011</xref>). The combination of investigating the response mechanism of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> to past climate change and predicting future climate suitability is beneficial for devising an effective conservation strategy. Our findings highlight the importance of combining a historical perspective with future predictions to develop a global conservation planning strategy for organisms in a changing world.
