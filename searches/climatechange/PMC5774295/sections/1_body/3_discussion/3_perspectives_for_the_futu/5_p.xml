<p class="p">Given the limited accessibility of certain species to climatically suitable areas and their inability to adapt to new climate conditions 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>, assisted migration has been suggested as a supplementary means of conservation (

 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> has been confirmed by the success of current cultivated introductions in a variety of sites, even in climatically unsuitable areas, such as the National Forest Park of Yaoxiang in Shandong Province and Xiaolongshan Botanical Garden in Ganshu Province. However, one major concern associated with assisted migration is the potential for disrupting the native ecological balance at the target sites (

 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> within east China are unlikely to create devastating negative effects. In addition, the mast seeding of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> with an approximate 5-yr cycle and its limited migration ability suggest a very low possibility that it will exhibit invasive tendencies in introduction areas. Thus, assisted migration is likely to be an effective conservation strategy.
