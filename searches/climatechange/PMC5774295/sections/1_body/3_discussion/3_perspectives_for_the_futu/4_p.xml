<p class="p">By comparison, the population confined to the southern contraction regions will face a different challenge: struggling with the burden of the upcoming unsuitable climate. To avoid extinction, adaptation to new climate conditions is an alternative in addition to migration, and the adaptation rate must be in equilibrium with the rate of climate change (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>). Regardless, climate change commonly overwhelms the adaptation of species (

 <xref rid="ref-93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petit, Hu &amp; Dick, 2008</xref>) and almost certainly will in the future because of the unprecedentedly rapid rate (

 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jump &amp; Penuelas, 2005</xref>). Because of its evolutionary stasis for at least 56 million years ago, there is a slight possibility of niche evolution for 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> for adaptation in the coming decades (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">LePage &amp; Basinger, 1995</xref>). Moreover, although some behavioural and/or evolutionary adaptations may occur, the adaptation rate will likely be too slow to match the unprecedented rapidity of climate change, largely due to the slow reproductive rate resulting from the mast seeding and long lifespan of the species. Consequently, the high rate of niche evolution required for a high adaptation rate stands in stark contrast to the supposed evolutionary stasis in 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>’ niches. This suggests that the population of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> confined to the southern contraction areas may not adapt to the coming new climate.
