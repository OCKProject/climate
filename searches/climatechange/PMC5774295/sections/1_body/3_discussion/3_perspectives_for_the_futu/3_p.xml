<p class="p">The incomplete range filling of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> may be related to its limited accessibility to climate suitability, as shown in its response to post-LGM climate change. As portrayed in its post-LGM colonization, geographic barriers, landscape modifications and low migration ability may continually affect the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>. For example, the Daba Mountains may prevent the northward expansion of the population from the Sichuan Basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3F</xref>). Although no high mountains are present, landscape modifications, such as land-use changes and concomitant habitat destruction, degradation and fragmentation in Henan and Shandong (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3F</xref>), may disrupt dispersal processes (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haila, 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fazey, Fischer &amp; Lindenmayer, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fischer &amp; Lindenmayer, 2007</xref>). In contrast, the limitation of the low migration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> appears particularly prominent against the background of the unprecedented rate of ongoing climate change. This unprecedented climate change necessitates species dispersal that is rapid enough to match the climate shifts (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huntley, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2008</xref>). Theoretically, to keep up with climate change in the coming decades, 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> must move from its dispersal source in China up to an elevation of 750 km by the end of 2080, with most distances being greater than 100 km. (Because there is no living 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> in Korea and Japan, expansion there in the future is not realistic.) The migration rate necessary to achieve such great distances in the coming decades is greater than the inferred rate of range shifts of 300 to 500 km per century that is required for plants to track climate change in the 21st century (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis &amp; Shaw, 2001</xref>). However, the actual migration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>, as deduced from the process of its post-LGM colonization, may be much lower. Without knowledge of the actual migration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>, the commonly observed past migration rates of trees of 20 to 40 km per century (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis, 1986</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis &amp; Shaw, 2001</xref>) can provide a reference. Therefore, the lower migration rate of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> relative to the climate-change velocity will also likely lead to its failure to fully colonize the future climatically suitable areas.
