<p class="p">In addition to the latitudinal shift in distribution, a shift towards higher elevations is suggested as an additional response of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>. This elevational shift is predicted to mainly occur in unchanged climatically suitable areas. Compared to latitudinal migration, unassisted elevational shift may be feasible for 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>, as the migration distances to climatically suitable areas are relatively short. Nonetheless, to increase the probability of success in elevational shift, assisted migration in elevational direction should also be considered.
