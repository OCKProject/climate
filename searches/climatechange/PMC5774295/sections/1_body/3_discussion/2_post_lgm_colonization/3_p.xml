<p class="p">In southeast China, multiple factors may be responsible for the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> in climatically suitable areas. For example, the relatively high mountains southeast of the Sichuan Basin and north of Guangxi Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>) may have blocked the tree from moving into the surrounding areas. This block led to its incomplete expansion and its absence from the southwestern part of the potential climatically suitable area. In contrast, in areas that are not blocked by high mountains, exclusion of populations from established colonization may be the main reason for the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic>, such as in Jiangxi Province, the eastern part of Hubei Province and the southern part of Anhui Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>). Another notable absence occurred in the northeastern regions of the predicted climatically suitable areas, such as Jiangsu Province (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>). The migration distance required to fully cover climatically suitable areas is as great as ∼300–480 km, and the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> may indicate that the actual distance migrated was shorter than the theoretically required value, revealing a limited dispersal ability. Although certain factors played a leading role in the absence of 
 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> from specific regions, the contributions of other abovementioned factors should not be overlooked.
