 <italic class="italic">P. amabilis</italic> suggest that the present climate strongly shaped the current distribution of this species; however, other forces, such as its limited long-distance dispersal ability, geographical barriers or human influence, constrained its ability to completely fill potential climatically suitable areas. Our results support the view that although climate exerts a dominant control over the natural distribution of species on a regional to global scale, non-climatic factors play important supplementary roles at the local level (
