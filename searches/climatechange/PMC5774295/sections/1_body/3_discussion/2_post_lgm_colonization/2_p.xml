<p class="p">The absence of extant species from climatically suitable areas may result from time-lagged migration or the exclusion of species from established colonization (
 <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Normand et al., 2011</xref>). The migration performance of a species is related to its intrinsic dispersal ability and extrinsic influencing factors, such as the locations of ice age refugia, geographical barriers, habitat fragmentation and competition with established vegetation (
