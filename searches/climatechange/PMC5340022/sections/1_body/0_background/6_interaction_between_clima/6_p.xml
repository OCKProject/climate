 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. In East Germany the main sources of air pollution were the industries and private coal burning for heating purposes, differently in in West Germany where traffic-related air pollutants and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> exposure were prevalent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. The authors thus analyzed the impact of different environmental and social conditions on the development of allergies in two genetically homogeneous populations. The results showed that hay fever, skin test reactivity to common aeroallergens and asthma were considerably more prevalent in West Germany as compared to East Germany [
