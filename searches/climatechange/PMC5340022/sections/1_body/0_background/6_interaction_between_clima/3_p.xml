<p class="p">Studies have demonstrated some effects of ozone over respiratory symptoms, acute decreases in lung function, increased airway responsiveness, airway injury and inflammation and systemic oxidative stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Gent et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] examined the simultaneous effects of ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) at levels below EPA standards on daily respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children with asthma. Ozone level (but not PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) was significantly associated with respiratory symptoms and rescue medication use among children using maintenance medication. A 50 parts per billion (ppb) increase in 1-h ozone was associated with increased likelihood of wheeze (by 35%) and chest tightness (by 47%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. The highest levels of ozone (1-h or 8-h averages) were associated with increased shortness of breath and rescue medication use [
