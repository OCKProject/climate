<p class="p">Climate change represents a massive threat to global health, affecting local and national food supplies, air and water quality, weather, economics and many other critical health determinants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Air pollution is closely associated with climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Over the last 50 years global earth’s temperature has markedly risen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations, as stated in the Working Group I Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The key determinants of greenhouse gas emissions are energy production, transportation, agriculture, food production and waste management, and attempts at mitigating climate change will need to address each of these. A huge increase in carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) concentrations during the last decades has been experienced [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, and its atmospheric concentration has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. About 75% of the anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions to the atmosphere during the past 20 years resulted from fossil fuel burning; most of the rest resulted from changes in land use, especially deforestation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The same trend occurred for the other prevalent anthropogenic greenhouse gases: methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, it is important to consider that after CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions are reduced and atmospheric concentrations stabilize, surface air temperature continues to rise slowly for a century or more. Furthermore, rising temperatures contribute to the elevation of the concentrations of ozone (due to more sunlight and higher temperature) and particulate matter (due to wildfire, droughts, desertification, sandstorms and an increased use of coal-fired power to produce energy for cooling) at ground level [
