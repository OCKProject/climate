<p class="p">Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that urbanization, high levels of vehicle emissions and westernized lifestyle are correlated with an increase in the frequency of pollen-induced respiratory allergy in people who live in urban areas compared to those who live in rural areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Studies on plant responses to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations indicate that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen. Wayne et al. observed that a doubling of the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration stimulated ragweed-pollen production by 61%. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Furthermore, ragweed pollen collected along high-traffic roads showed a higher allergenicity than pollen sampled in vegetated areas, and it is probably due to traffic related pollution. Climate change may also affect the release and atmospheric dispersion of pollen [
