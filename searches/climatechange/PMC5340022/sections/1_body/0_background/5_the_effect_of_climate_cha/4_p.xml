<p class="p">An earlier start and peak of the pollen season is more pronounced in species that start flowering early in the year. Moreover, plants flower earlier in urban areas than in the corresponding rural areas with earlier pollination of about 2â€“4 days. Pollen counts could rise due to multiple mechanisms such as increased ambient carbon dioxide levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. With warming over the longer term, changing patterns of plant habitat and species density are likely, with gradual movement northward in the Northern Hemisphere, and further south in the Southern Hemisphere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. The change in land use might also play a relevant role, especially for some important allergenic species, such as grasses. However, since most data come from the analysis of distribution of airborne pollen, these findings are potentially biased by the occurrence of long and medium distance transport episodes of allergenic pollen [
