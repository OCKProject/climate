<p class="p">However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 Km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the ‘hotspots’ of global environmental change on the planet [

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50–70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Recently Song et al., using satellite-data of deforestation rates, derived from changes in tree cover density in the humid tropics, have estimated that between 2000 and 2010, a total of 15.9 ± 2.5 Mha (million ha) forests were lost, which represented 2.6% of the total basin area, or 2.9% of forests in year 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. The Brazilian Amazon and the non-Brazilian Amazon lost a total of 12.5 ± 2.0 Mha and 3.4 ± 0.5 Mha forests respectively and over that decade. Brazil was the dominant country in terms of deforested area, which accounted for 79% of the total lost forests [
