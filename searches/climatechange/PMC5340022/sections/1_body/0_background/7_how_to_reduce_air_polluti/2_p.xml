<p class="p">Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has been demonstrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32–36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. In this way tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink for decades.
