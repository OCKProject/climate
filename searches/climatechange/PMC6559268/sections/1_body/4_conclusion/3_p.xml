<p class="p">Overall, the information provided in this study can inform decision makers on how northeastern forests may respond to dual stressors of N deposition and climate change over this century, and potentially be used to manage forests and their attendant ecosystem services in the face of these changes. Ecosystem services have been specifically mentioned in the EPA's review of the secondary (welfare‚Äêbased) standards for oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, and particulate matter (USEPA

This study contributes to that review process and provides a blueprint for future analyses on how to estimate effects from changes in air quality on issues of public concern. We also believe this study can be a model for future efforts aimed at improving predictions of how forests may respond to shifts in deposition and climate. These types of efforts will be essential for informing environmental policies directly affecting the health and productivity of forest ecosystems.
