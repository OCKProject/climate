<p class="p">A second objective of this study was to identify research areas for extending and improving this approach. One research priority is to expand the model to include more regions, tree species, and environmental stressors such as sulfur deposition and ozone. Another is to improve the tree composition estimates to include the influences of climate and atmospheric deposition on recruitment and ingrowth of new trees, to enable a multi‚Äêcohort study. Another research priority should be to explore and ideally quantify how changes in forest composition could affect other ecosystem services. These other services could, for example, include aesthetic services such as those derived from fall foliage, regulating services such as erosion control and water storage in forested areas, or improved resistance to disease and pests.</p>
