<p class="p">The primary objective of this study was to develop a proof of concept analysis to assess the effect of N deposition and climate change on forest composition and ecosystems services, with a case study focus on the northeastern United States. As expected, due to the wide variation in how individual species respond to changes in N deposition and climate, large differences in forest composition were predicted across scenarios by the end of the study period (2100). For example, the relative and absolute abundance of red maple trees were notably higher under both high N deposition and high climate change scenarios, whereas yellow birch and red pine were negatively affected in both cases. The effects on forest ecosystem service also varied significantly across scenarios. Carbon sequestration, which is positively associated with total biomass accumulation, was higher in scenarios involving more N deposition and increased climate change. For merchantable timber, whereas total timber values increased with overall biomass, the scenarios with more climate change tended to favor species with lower merchantable value, and the scenarios with more N deposition tended to favor species with higher merchantable value. With regard to tree species diversity, climate change was found to have a mostly negative influence on adult tree species diversity, especially in the northwestern, central, and southeastern portions of the study area. The effects of N deposition on diversity were mixed across the study area, increasing diversity in parts of the Midwest, and adding to the negative effect of climate in parts of the east and northern Midwest. The variable effects of N deposition on tree diversity are more difficult to manage and suggest a species‚Äêlevel approach may be more advantageous.</p>
