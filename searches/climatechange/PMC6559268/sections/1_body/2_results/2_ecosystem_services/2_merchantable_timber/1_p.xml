<p class="p">The provisioning services provided by forests through their stock of merchantable timber also varied across N deposition and climate change scenarios, depending in part on how the scenarios shifted forest composition toward or away from species with more or less commercial value. To capture these differences, we estimated how both the total tree biomass (in Mg) and the TMV index for each scenario compared to the reference scenario (Return to PE/Constant) in 2100 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>). Because of missing price data for 2 of the 24 species, scarlet oak and sweet birch, which account for 2.5% of total biomass in 2005, these estimates for biomass and TMV only included the 22 species with available price data. As for total biomass, we found that TMV was positively affected by N deposition and climate change; however, the 
 <italic class="italic">magnitudes</italic> of the deviations from the reference scenario were somewhat different. In the scenarios with the highest N deposition (Constant), the positive deviations from the reference scenario were always predicted to be greater for TMV (orange bars) than for total biomass (blue bars), ranging from 1 to 5 percentage points higher. These results indicate that the species with the largest increases in biomass with respect to increased N deposition levels also tended to be the higher priced species., such as black cherry, sugar maple, yellow poplar, white ash, and northern red oak. The opposite effect was observed for the scenarios with more climate change. When only climate changes from the reference scenario, TMV increased at a lower rate than total biomass. For example, going from the Constant/Constant scenario to the Constant/RCP8.5 scenario, total biomass increased by 9 percentage points, compared to 5 percentage points for TMV. In this case, several higher priced species, such as black cherry and yellow poplar, were negatively affected by scenarios with the most climate change, and lower priced species such as eastern hemlock and American beech were among the most positively affected.
