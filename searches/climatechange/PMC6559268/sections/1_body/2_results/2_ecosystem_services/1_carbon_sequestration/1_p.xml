<p class="p">For each of the 12 future N deposition–climate scenarios, the trajectory of C sequestration in 5‐yr increments was estimated for the modeled cohort (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). The highest levels of sequestration occurred in the scenarios that included the Constant (high) N deposition scenarios, and more climate change (higher temp and precipitation; RCP 8.5). The scenarios with lower N deposition, and smaller changes in temperature and precipitation, resulted in less sequestration.
