<p class="p">Although sequestration occurred in each scenario and each period, the rate of C accumulation actually declined from 2005 to 2025 for the scenarios involving a reduction in N deposition (CAA2025 and Return to PE). This decline occurred because N deposition fell in these scenarios over the first 20 yr (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), before flattening out for the remainder of the simulation period. The flat period of deposition was still associated with increasing C stocks as forests continued to mature. In all scenarios, the 5‐yr rate of C sequestration peaked in the mid‐range of the simulation period (2040–2055) before the cumulative effects of cohort mortality had begun to accumulate.
