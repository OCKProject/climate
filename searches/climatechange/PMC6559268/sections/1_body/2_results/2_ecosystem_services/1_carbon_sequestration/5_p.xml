<p class="p">Comparing the present values of C sequestration across scenarios for the modeled cohort of trees (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0006" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>), we found that, compared to the Return to PE/Constant scenario with a present value of US$533 billion, the present value of C sequestration was 58% higher in the scenario with most N deposition and climate change (Constant/RCP8.5). Once again, differences in N deposition across scenarios had a larger effect on the present value of C accumulation than differences in climate change. Increasing N deposition to Constant levels relative to the Return to PE levels increased present value by 46%, whereas increasing temperatures and precipitation to RCP8.5 conditions increased it by 13%.
