<p class="p">The present value (in US$) of C sequestration was estimated for each scenario in each 5‐yr period after applying period‐specific SCC values (in 5‐yr increments) to each unit of C sequestered. Because benefits accruing farther in the future have less value from a present day perspective, we discounted all future benefits from sequestration back to the reference year 2015 using a 3% discount rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). Therefore, the present value estimates represent the time‐discounted sum of avoided future climate change damages by removing and storing C from the atmosphere. For all scenarios, these present values reached a peak several years earlier than the peaks in C sequestration (in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>) due to the effects of discounting, which can have a larger negative effect on present values than the positive effect of increasing C sequestration.
