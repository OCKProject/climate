<p class="p">Compared to the Return to PE/Constant, in which 5.3 Zg were sequestered from 2005 to 2100, total C sequestration was 67% greater in the scenario with the highest levels of N deposition and the greatest climate change (Constant/RCP8.5; TableÂ 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Consistent with the trends in biomass accumulation, differences in N deposition across scenarios had a larger effect on C accumulation in 2100 than differences in climate change. The Constant N deposition scenarios increased sequestration by 51% relative to the Return to PE scenarios, whereas increasing climate change alone to RCP8.5 increased sequestration by 16%.
