<p class="p">By examining the ratio of the Shannon diversity index for each county and scenario relative to the Return to PE/Constant scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>), we found that tree diversity responses varied regionally and across scenarios. The higher RCP scenarios resulted in lower predicted tree diversity in several counties of New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, and along the Appalachian spine of Virginia, and increased tree diversity in a few small pockets of mostly Indiana and Maryland. Elevated N deposition was predicted to increase tree diversity in Illinois and Indiana and decrease diversity in the same states negatively impacted by climate. As with the other responses, N deposition appeared to have a larger magnitude of effect compared with climate change, leading to an overall increase in diversity in Illinois and Indiana when both stressors were high (Constant/RCP8.5), and an additive decrease in diversity for other regions. Generally, tree diversity in the New England region was unresponsive to either stressor because of offsetting responses at the species level (Appendix
