<p class="p">Regional differences in tree diversity were due to differential responses of forest communities across the landscape. For regions that decreased in diversity, this was mostly from increased dominance of black cherry due to higher N deposition, and to a lesser degree from red maple (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0012" ref-type="fig" class="xref">12</xref>). These were the two strongest N‐responders and combined responders (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), and their increases came at the expense of several other species. Red maple was already relatively abundant, so further increases in its abundance decreased diversity by reducing species evenness. Black cherry, on the other hand, was rarer under the Return to PE/Constant scenario but was predicted to increase with higher deposition, which would competitively exclude other species. For regions with predicted increased tree diversity, this effect was largely due to decreases in American basswood, black oak, and red oak. These species are relatively abundant in the midwestern portion of the study area; thus, their decrease would increase Shannon diversity due to a decrease in dominance by these species. It should also be noted that red maple is largely absent in this midwestern region under both current and future projected conditions, and the absence of this otherwise dominant species also likely contributed the large changes in diversity in that region of the study area. Other species also contributed to these predicted changes in diversity, but their contributions were more localized or scattered (Appendix
