<p class="p">Total aboveground biomass in 2005, the baseline for the modeled cohort and study region, was 6.34 Pg (first bar in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The three dominant species that together accounted for over 44% the total biomass were eastern hemlock (

 <italic class="italic">Acer rubrum</italic>; 15%), and sugar maple (
 <italic class="italic">Acer saccharum</italic>; 13%). The five other most prevalent species were northern red oak (
