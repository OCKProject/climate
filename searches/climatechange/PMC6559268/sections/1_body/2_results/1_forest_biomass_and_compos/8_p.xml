<p class="p">Differences were also observed across species in their sensitivity to the combined effects of N deposition and climate change. Going from the combined scenario with the lowest N deposition and least climate change (Return to PE/Constant; Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) to the one with highest deposition and most climate change (Constant/RCP8.5), five species end up with lower biomass: American basswood, bigtooth aspen, quaking aspen, red pine and yellow birch. All species were projected to decrease by 10 Tg or more. Red maple was projected to have the largest increase in biomass, increasing by over 3 Pg. Differences in the relative abundance of each species in each county, comparing RCP 8.5/Constant scenario (highest climate change and N deposition) and the Constant/Return to PE scenario (lowest climate and N deposition) in 2100 are shown in Appendix
