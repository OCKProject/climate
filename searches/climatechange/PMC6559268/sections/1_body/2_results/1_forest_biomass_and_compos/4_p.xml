<p class="p">Overall, the amount of total biomass in 2100, in response to the growth and mortality combined, was positively related to both greater N deposition and climate change, with N deposition being the stronger driver of response. Varying the climate projections from Constant (no change) to RCP8.5 (most change) led to 7–10% more total biomass in 2100 averaged across the three N deposition scenarios (even though stem count declined), whereas higher N deposition projections in the Constant scenario compared to the Return to PE (i.e., largest difference) led to 22–24% more biomass in 2100 averaged across the four climate scenarios.</p>
