<p class="p">Because the simulations tracked a single mixed‐age cohort of trees over this period, net changes in total biomass from year to year were driven by individual tree growth (positive effect) and mortality (negative effect). Average annual tree growth from 2005 to 2100, which varied between 23–34 kg·tree
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>·yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> across scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), was positively influenced by both N deposition (+4–5 Pg of biomass in 2100 across N deposition scenarios) and climate change (+1–2 Pg of biomass across climate change scenarios). In contrast, total tree mortality, which resulted in the loss of between 60–62% of trees from 2005–2100, was lower under conditions of high N deposition but higher under conditions with more climate change (i.e., larger GHG increases), predominantly due to the projected effects of higher temperatures. Thus, in 2100, there were roughly 130 million fewer trees in the Return to PE scenario compared with the Constant deposition scenario because of lower N deposition, and 200 million fewer trees in RCP8.5 compared with the Constant climate scenario because of higher temperatures.
