<p class="p">Changes in cohort biomass from 2005 to 2100 varied markedly across species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The species showing the greatest average gains in cohort biomass across all scenarios were red maple (3.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">12 </sup>kg), yellow poplar (1.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">12</sup> kg), sugar maple (1.5 × 10
 <sup class="sup">12 </sup>kg), and chestnut oak (1.1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">12 </sup>kg; Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Three species, paper birch (
 <italic class="italic">Betula papyrifera)</italic>, quaking aspen (
 <italic class="italic">Populus tremuloides</italic>), and balsam fir (
 <italic class="italic">Abies balsamea</italic>), lost absolute biomass across all 12 scenarios (average of 1.6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">10 </sup>kg, 1.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">10 </sup>kg, and 6 × 10
 <sup class="sup">10</sup> kg, respectively). The species showing the greatest average gains in percentage of total biomass (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>) were red maple (8%) and yellow poplar (5%), and those showing the greatest losses were yellow birch (
 <italic class="italic">Betula alleghaniensis</italic>) and eastern hemlock (loss of 5% and 8%, respectively). Interestingly, eastern hemlock declined the most in relative abundance even though its biomass increased in all scenarios from 2005 to 2100. Its relative decline occurred because of the much larger rates of biomass growth experienced by other tree species. Additional species biomass change comparisons are shown in Appendix
