<p class="p">Individual tree species responded differently to the N deposition and climate scenarios because of differences in responses and initial conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Comparing modeled conditions in 2100, the species that showed strongest increases in total biomass when N deposition was higher (i.e., comparing Constant with Return to PE, termed “N‐winners”) included red maple, black cherry, yellow poplar, sugar maple, and northern red oak. In contrast, species whose biomass in 2100 was lower for scenarios with higher N deposition (termed the “N‐losers”) included chestnut oak, American basswood (
 <italic class="italic">Tilia americana</italic>), yellow birch, bigtooth aspen (
 <italic class="italic">Populus grandidentata</italic>), and red pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus resinosa</italic>). Several other species showed relatively little to no responses to N deposition, including, white oak, American beech, black oak (
 <italic class="italic">Quercus velutina</italic>), sweet birch (
 <italic class="italic">Betula lenta</italic>), and red spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea rubens</italic>). Note that these shorthand names refer to how the species responds to an increase in the stressor, not how it responds to expected future changes in the stressor (which, as in the case of N deposition, could be negative).
