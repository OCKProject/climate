<p class="p">With regard to climate scenarios, the species showing the largest positive differences in biomass in 2100 when going from the Constant climate scenario to the RCP8.5 scenario (termed “climate winners”) included red maple and chestnut oak, whereas the species that had less total biomass in 2100 under scenarios with more climate change (termed “climate losers”) included yellow poplar, northern red oak, black cherry, red pine, white ash (
 <italic class="italic">Fraxinus Americana</italic>), northern white cedar (
 <italic class="italic">Thuja occidentalis</italic>), and yellow birch (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Thus, red maple increased with more of both stressors, yellow birch and red pine decreased with more of both stressors, and chestnut oak had countervailing responses (i.e., N‐winners, climate losers). Total biomass for two species, pignut hickory (
 <italic class="italic">Carya glabra</italic>) and balsam fir, was relatively unresponsive to differences in climate.
