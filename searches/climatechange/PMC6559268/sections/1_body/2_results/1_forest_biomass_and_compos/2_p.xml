<p class="p">To analyze how forest composition was influenced by the 12 N deposition–climate scenarios, we estimated total tree biomass and distribution across species in 2100 for each scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The starting basal area (i.e., in 2005) of the FIA plots within the study area ranged from 4.5–40 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/ha (5th–95th percentile) and averaged 22 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/ha, which indicates a relatively young, immature forest condition. Compared to 2005, total aboveground biomass increased by between 9.7 Pg and 16.1 Pg (a factor of between 2.5 and 3.5) across scenarios.
