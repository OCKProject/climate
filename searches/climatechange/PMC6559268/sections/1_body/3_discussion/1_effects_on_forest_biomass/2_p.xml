<p class="p">The modeled increase in biomass by a factor of between 2.5 and 3.5 from 2005 to 2100 is reasonable for an aggrading forest such as the northeastern United States. For instance, reported basal areas for old growth and mature stands in the northeastern United States range from 16 to 147 m
