<p class="p">Similar conditions were seen in response to the three RCP climate futures. For temperature, by 2100 the percent of all trees experiencing conditions outside of the Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) empirical ranges varied from 2.6% for RCP2.6 to 39% for RCP8.5. Across the individual species and scenarios, the percent experiencing temperatures lower or higher than those used to model the species responses varied from 0% to 100% (Appendix
