<p class="p">Finally, to monetize these ecosystems services we applied simple unit value estimates, SCC values for C and stumpage prices for timber, which each have large ranges of uncertainty, particularly when projected farther into the future. For example, using recently observed timber prices (averaged over states in the study area) to assess the relative values of merchantable timber in the future assumes that the relative demand for and costs of harvesting the species will be similar in the future. As global forest stocks, human tastes, and harvest technologies evolve in the future, these relative prices are likely to change, but in ways that are difficult to predict.</p>
