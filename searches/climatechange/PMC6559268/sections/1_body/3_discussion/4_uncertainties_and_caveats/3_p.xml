<p class="p">Third, the restrictions imposed by our model on the growth and survival estimates of tree species to their observed ranges imply that the estimated biomass responses are conservative. For all parameters (biomass, N deposition, precipitation, and temperature), once plot conditions were outside the Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) empirical ranges for a species, annual growth and survival were modeled to continue at the rate associated with the upper or lower limit for that variable. As the future scenarios progressively deviated from the current deposition and climate conditions, the proportion of trees reaching the upper or lower limits of their empirical ranges of N deposition, temperature and precipitation increased. For example, by 2025 (the last year with N deposition changing), 53% of all trees exposed to CAA2025 deposition were experiencing N deposition lower than lowest N deposition reported by Thomas et al. (

 <xref rid="ecm1345-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>: Table S1). In response to the Return to PE scenario, despite differences across species in their timing of reaching lower limits, 100% of all trees and species had hit the lowest N deposition level by 2025. Therefore, the effective lowest N deposition level in this scenario was above 0.4 kg N/ha for all species (ranging from 3.4 kg N/ha to 5.4 kg N/ha across species).
