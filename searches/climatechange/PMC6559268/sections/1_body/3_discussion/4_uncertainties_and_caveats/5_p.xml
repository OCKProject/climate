<p class="p">Consequently, the actual responses to lower N levels and higher temperatures would most likely result in even larger growth and survival responses relative to current conditions and thus larger potential changes in species composition. However, it is not possible to determine the magnitude of these biomass responses or their potential impacts on ecosystem services. We considered extrapolating the empirical relationships from Thomas etÂ al. (
