<p class="p">In interpreting the results from this study, it important to recognize certain inherent constraints and uncertainties. First, in examining the effects of climate change on forests, this study only addressed the effects of projected changes in mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. It did not include many other potential factors, including episodic shifts in temperature and precipitation (e.g., drought, seasonal changes in precipitation timing or amount), potential CO

For example, some pathogens, such as wooly adelgid (
