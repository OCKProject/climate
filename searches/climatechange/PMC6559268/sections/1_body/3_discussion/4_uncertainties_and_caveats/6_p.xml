<p class="p">Fourth, in examining and comparing benefits from C sequestration, the analysis did not account for changes in belowground C, which may also be affected by N availability and climate change. Nor did the analysis account for any feedback effects that sequestration may have on the climate change scenarios. In other words, the analysis estimated how alternative climate change predictions could affect rates of C sequestration, but it did not adjust the climate prediction to account of the effects of sequestration. Nevertheless, this feedback effect is not expected to be large because in the model simulations C sequestration was at most about 100 Tg/yr, which is only about 2% of current annual U.S. C emissions (USEPA

Indeed, the entire land use, land‐use change, and forestry (LULUCF) sector sink is roughly 11% of the total U.S. GHG emissions; thus, the contribution from the 19‐state area in the Northeast that we examined is expected to be a fraction of that.
