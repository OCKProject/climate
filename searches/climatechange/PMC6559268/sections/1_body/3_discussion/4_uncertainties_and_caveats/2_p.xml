<p class="p">Second, our approach for projecting forest growth and change in associated ecosystem services into the future is a simplified representation of these processes. It uses only the mean response estimates from Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), without accounting for parameter uncertainty or uncertainties from applying estimates based on spatial variation to assess changes over time. Also, by modeling the growth and survival of a single mixed‐age cohort of trees, the results only reflect the responses of this single population of trees and not the forest in its entirety. Our analysis did not factor in the influences of climate and N deposition on the ingrowth of new trees (or new tree species due to range shifts) and how ecosystem services might be further impacted by changes in sapling recruitment. Furthermore, other factors such as disturbance, and light gaps known to affect forest growth and dynamics were not accounted for in our model predictions. A process‐based dynamic forest model (e.g., ED2; Medvigy et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) could be used to add complexity to these estimates. Many of these models, however, aggregate species into broad functional groups (e.g. broadleaf vs. coniferous), and thus cannot be used directly at present to look at species‐level changes in forests. However, comparing our species‐level responses aggregated to common functional groups could yield a basis for comparison with forest dynamic models. In addition, our analysis does not account for future forest management activities that which may contribute to forest turnover and limit biomass growth and carbon sequestration.
