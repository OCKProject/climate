<p class="p">A wide variety of tree diversity responses were also predicted across the region, with increases in some central midwestern states and decreases in northern midwestern states and eastern states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>). The implications of this variation depend on the ecosystem function or service of interest. For ecosystem services that are positively associated with tree diversity (e.g., soil carbon storage; Gamfeldt et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), lower diversity is expected to entail less services. For ecosystem services that are more associated with an individual species (e.g., maple syrup from sugar maple), then less diversification that favors this individual species can increase services. Teasing apart these complexities for a wider range of services and species is an area of future work.
