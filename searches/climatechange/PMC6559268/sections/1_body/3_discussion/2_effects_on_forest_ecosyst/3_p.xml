<p class="p">Other services, such as merchantable timber were predicted to have more mixed effects. Whereas total timber values increased with overall biomass, the scenarios with more climate change tended to favor species with lower merchantable value. This result is broadly consistent with estimates for European forests (Hanewinkel etÂ al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), which indicated a shift toward forest types with lower economic returns as climate continues to change over the next century. The opposite effect was observed for the scenarios with more N deposition; this suggests that we will be losing an unanticipated benefit of poor air quality in the future.
