<p class="p">The wide range of forest composition shifts estimated in this study under alternative N deposition and climate change scenarios has varying implications for forest ecosystem services. Some ecosystem services, such as C sequestration, are positively associated with total biomass accumulation, which was positively associated with both N deposition and climate change in our cohort simulations. This is not surprising since N is often a limiting nutrient in many terrestrial ecosystems. Furthermore, climate change in the northeast is expected to make conditions warmer and wetter, which is often observed with increases in productivity (Nemani et al.

This does not preclude other negative effects from climate factors not accounted for in this study (e.g., increased drought, fire, pests, etc.), and should only be interpreted as the projected impacts from changes in mean climate conditions.
