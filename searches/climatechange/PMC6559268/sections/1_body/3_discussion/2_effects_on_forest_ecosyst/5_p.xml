<p class="p">Because our analysis focused on only three main types of ecosystem services that can be readily quantified for our study area, it is important to note that individually affected trees species may provide a variety of other services, many of which may be differently affected by N deposition or climate change (Table A3). However, these changes in services are much more difficult to quantify. For example, three species experiencing the greatest negative effects from higher levels of N deposition (measured as a percentage decline in their biomass) were quaking aspen, yellow birch, and bigtooth aspen. Quaking aspen trees are widely appreciated for their aesthetic qualities, including their light bark and bright fall foliage (Perala

 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). Two of the tree species projected to experience the greatest negative effects from higher levels of climate change were black cherry and white ash (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). In addition to providing wood that is highly valued for cabinet and furniture making, a number of traditional uses have been documented for black cherry, including providing an edible fruit for wines and jellies (Marquis 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). White ash is particularly well known for its use in baseball bats (Irvine et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Because the above ecosystem services were not examined in our study, the overall effect on ecosystem services remains unknown until a complete accounting can be performed. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates how the effects of N deposition and climate change on forests can be species specific and that this variation is predicted to change at least a subset of key ecosystem services provided by northeastern forests.
