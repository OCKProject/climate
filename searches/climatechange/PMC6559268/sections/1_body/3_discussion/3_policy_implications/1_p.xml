<p class="p">These findings underscore the tradeoffs that must be considered when evaluating policies to manage the effects of N deposition and climate change on forest ecosystems and the services they provide. Overall, policies to limit N deposition and climate change are expected to limit growth in total biomass for the current mixed‚Äêage cohort of forest trees in the northeastern United States and the directly associated ecosystem services such as C sequestration. However, this trend may not be ubiquitous across the United States, as forests in other areas may show more consistently negative responses to changes in climate and high levels of N deposition. The reduction in tree diversity associated with greater changes in climate could reduce many ecosystem services not explicitly assessed, and especially those associated with species projected to decrease with climate change (especially yellow poplar, black cherry, and white ash). Furthermore, in the northeast, the effects of forest composition change on ecosystem services are predicted to be very mixed. This is because individual species can provide different combinations of services and because compositional changes can both increase and decrease diversity. In some instances, humans may even associate negative value with any alteration in the tree species composition with which they are familiar (Meyerhoff and Liebe
