<p class="p">In summary, a total of 12 deposition–climate future scenarios from 2005 to 2100 were evaluated in this study (Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). As a point of reference for comparing modeled outcomes at the end of the simulation period (2100), we selected the combination of the Return to pre‐European N deposition and Constant climate (Return to PE/Constant) as the focal “reference scenario.” This deposition–climate combination, which represents a “low pollution” scenario, was chosen as the focal reference scenario to help simplify the interpretation of results. From this reference point, all other scenarios represent larger changes in climate and increases in N deposition.
