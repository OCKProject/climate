 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) used PRISM climate data to represent annual mean temperature and annual precipitation by conducting bilinear interpolation of 800‐m resolution climate records (AN81m data set) during the years between FIA plot measurements (data 
 <italic class="italic">available online</italic>).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="ecm1345-note-1003" class="xref">2</xref> In the interest of using the most comparable climate data set, we selected PRISM 30‐yr average (1981–2010) climate data at 4‐km resolution as the “base” temperature and precipitation data sets for the USFS FIA plots within the study area. The four climate scenarios were then determined by calculating percent change within a scenario and grid cell, which were then multiplied by these “base” climate maps.
