<p class="p">Four climate scenarios, consisting of total annual precipitation and average annual temperature from 2005 to 2100, were applied to the study area USFS FIA plots. Three of these scenarios are based on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which are the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration trajectories used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their Annual Report 5 (AR5; IPCC 2014) to represent possible climate futures. The four scenarios are: (1) recent climate, averaged over a 30‐yr period (1981–2010), continued into the future (hereafter referred to as “Constant”), (2) RCP2.6, which is the low‐end GHG concentration trajectory from the IPCC AR5, (3) RCP6.0, which is one of the mid‐range GHG concentration trajectories in the IPCC AR5, and (4) RCP8.5, which is the high‐end GHG concentration trajectory from the IPCC AR5.</p>
