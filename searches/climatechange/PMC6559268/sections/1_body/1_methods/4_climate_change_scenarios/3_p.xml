<p class="p">The Constant climate scenario consisted of repeating the PRISM 30‐yr average annual temperature and precipitation within each grid cell from 2005–2100. The three future IPCC RCP climate scenarios consisted of ~900 m resolution NASA NEX‐DCP30 modeled annual precipitation and temperature translated into percent changes in climate from 2005–2100 (data

Consistent with the general trends reflected in the NASA NEC RCP climate scenarios, these percent changes were then applied as linear changes in temperature and precipitation from 2006–2100. Thus, we preserved the spatial pattern of precipitation and temperature in the empirical record and the spatial pattern in the relative changes projected in the AR5. Fig.

 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows how temperature and precipitation are projected to increase across the study area for the RCP2.6, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios. In contrast to the temperature changes, which are relatively uniform across the study area, the changes in precipitation vary more widely. Across the three scenarios, changes in precipitation are generally larger in counties located farther to the north and east. Maps of baseline (in 2005) average annual temperature and precipitation levels are shown in Appendix
