<p class="p">As forest composition changes in response to different N deposition and climate futures, so will the ecosystem services provided. To identify specific ecosystem services provided by each of the 24 species, we began by reviewing the USFS Fire Effects Information System (FEIS), which is a comprehensive resource summarizing the ecology, wildlife uses, and products derived from 1,084 species (
 <italic class="italic">available online</italic>).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="ecm1345-note-1005" class="xref">4</xref> We found that over 46 services are associated with the 24 tree species included in this study (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>: Table S3), all of which could theoretically either be positively or negatively impacted by altered forest composition. However, it is difficult to quantify changes for many of these services. For example, compositional changes are likely to affect benefits from forest recreation and aesthetics (e.g., fall foliage, bird nesting habitat, etc.), but research and other evidence connecting forest composition to these benefits are limited. Thus, for the purposes of this study, which is a proof‐of‐concept piece, we focused on evaluating and quantifying the impacts on three key services that were more robust to estimate. First, we estimated differences in the amount and value of C that is sequestered in trees from 2005–2100 across the 12 scenarios. Secondly, we examined how the provisioning of merchantable timber is differentially affected across the scenarios. Third, to approximate the many services provided by increased forest biodiversity, we computed tree species diversity across scenarios. In the 
 <italic class="italic">Discussion</italic>, we further address and explore the broader set of ecosystem services (Table A.3) that may be impacted by the changes in tree diversity and forest composition.
