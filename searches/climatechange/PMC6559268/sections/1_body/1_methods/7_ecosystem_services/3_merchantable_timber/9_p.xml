<p class="p">It is important to note that C sequestration and the provision of merchantable timber are interconnected ecosystems services that cannot simply be added together. In particular, realizing the merchantable timber benefits requires harvesting trees at some point in the future; however, this process will affect sequestration (depending on how the timber is used and how forests are managed after extraction). As a simplification, our analysis did not account for future harvests and treats the two services as separate.</p>
