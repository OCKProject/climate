<p class="p">Using these state‐level estimates, we next estimated a region‐wide average price for each species (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">j</italic>
 </sub>). Ideally, we would weight state prices by the volume of timber exchanged in each state to calculate these averages. However, neither price nor timber volume data 
 <italic class="italic">for a given species</italic> were consistently available across states. As an alternative approximation of these weights, we used our FIA‐based estimates of the total state‐level biomass for each species in 2005. This weighting by state approximated the effect of more trees of a given species being potentially extracted from a state with a higher (or lower) price driving up (or down) the total market value of merchantable timber for that species. As shown in Table 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>, the species with the highest biomass‐weighted average prices per MBF were chestnut oak (US$560), black cherry (US$504), and sugar maple (US$438). The lowest were for quaking aspen (US$57), eastern hemlock (US$62), and paper birch (US$68).
