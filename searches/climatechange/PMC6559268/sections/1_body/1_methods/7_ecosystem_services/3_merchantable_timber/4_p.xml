 </sub> for each species. Most of the states in the 19‐state study region provide summaries of timber prices for selected species; however, there was considerable variation across states in the content and structure of these reports, including the tree species for which prices were reported (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>: Table S4). Most of these reports included data for recent years (2014–2016). The data were typically reported on an annual or seasonal basis, and they were sometimes reported by sub‐region within the state. We acquired reports for 15 of the 19 states included in the study region. Publicly available species‐specific price data are not available for years more recent than 2010 in Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, or New Jersey. Price data for Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island are reported as a single regional group. We summarized these available data by selecting the most recent year of available data on species‐specific stumpage prices (per MBF of saw timber) from each state (or regional group) and estimating average prices for the species of interest. Stumpage prices are the amount paid per unit for the right to harvest standing timber. Depending on how these prices were disaggregated and reported, we averaged across reported sub‐regions and time periods to produce a single price estimate for species with available data in each state (or group of states).
