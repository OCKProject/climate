<p class="p">Different tree species have different market values as timber. Thus, differences in the tree species composition of forests under alternative deposition and climate change scenario will also have implications for the commercial value of its standing timber resources. This value will differ across species depending on the qualities and attributes of the wood and its suitability for use in different wood products. In
