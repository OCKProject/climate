 <xref rid="ecm1345-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> provides a summary of collected price data. First, prices for only three species, sugar maple, red maple, and white ash, were reported by all 13 of the states/regions with data. The other most frequently reported species prices were for white oak (12 states), northern red oak (11), and black cherry (10). Second, no prices were reported in any of the states for two species: scarlet oak and sweet birch. Because of this missing price data, we estimated TMV

 </sub> by only summing across the 22 species for which we had data. Due to the relatively low prevalence of the two missing species in the study area and across scenarios (at most 2% for each one), results are very insensitive to whether these species are omitted from the analysis or included using surrogate prices (e.g., prices of other oaks and birches). Third, New York and Wisconsin included data for the largest number of species (17 and 15 species, respectively).
