<p class="p">To estimate the monetary value of sequestered C under each scenario and time period, we applied estimates of the social cost of C (SCC) (United States Government, Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon, 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The SCC is an estimate of the average per‚Äêunit global societal loss associated with each ton of C emitted in a specific year. Because C sequestration can be thought of as a negative C emission; SCC can also be interpreted as an 
 <italic class="italic">avoided</italic> cost (i.e., benefit) value per additional unit of C sequestered during the year. The SCC value varies according to the year in which the C is sequestered, because emissions further in the future are expected to be more damaging, as physical and economic systems become more stressed due to future climate change. These per ton values account for the flow of expected future damages from each unit of C emission, by discounting the future damages back to the year of emission. For this analysis, we selected the SCC estimates based on the central assumption of a 3% discount rate (estimates using 2.5% and 5% rates were also presented in the SCC report).
