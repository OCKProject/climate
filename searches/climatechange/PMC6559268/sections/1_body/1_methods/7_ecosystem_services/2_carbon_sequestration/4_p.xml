<p class="p">The Interagency Task Force reports SCC values for 5‐yr increments from 2010 to 2050; therefore, we also needed to extrapolate from these values to estimate SCC for the 2055 to 2100 period. Fitting a trend through the SCC estimates for 2010 to 2050 reveals an almost perfectly linear relationship. The linear relationship between SCC (expressed in 2007 U.S. dollars per Mg of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and the year (from 2010 to 2050) was estimated to be SCC = 0.96 × year + 1897.1 (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 99%). To convert the reported SCC estimates to values per Mg of carbon rather than CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, we multiplied by the ratio of their weights (3.667). To adjust for price inflation, converting from 2007 dollars to 2015 dollars, we multiplied by the ratio of the GDP price index in the 2 yr (1.13). Given this fit, we assumed that the same relationship would continue to hold and we extended through the 2050–2100 period. The resulting SCC estimates vary from US$128.5 per Mg of C sequestered in 2010 to US$480.5 in 2100. However, these values are only discounted back to the year in which the C sequestration occurs. To express them in present value terms in 2015, they were further discounted to 2015 at the same 3% rate. The resulting present values in 2015 vary from US$148.9 per Mg of C sequestered in 2010 to US$39 for C sequestered in 2100.
