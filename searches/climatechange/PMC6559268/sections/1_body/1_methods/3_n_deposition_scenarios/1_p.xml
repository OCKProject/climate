<p class="p">The three N deposition scenarios consisted of annual total (wet plus dry) N deposition estimates from 2005 to 2100 applied to each USFS FIA plot (using publicly available coordinates) in the 19‐state study area. These deposition scenarios included: (1) contemporary (circa 2005) N deposition repeated into the future (hereafter referred to as “Constant”), (2) reductions in N deposition according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) projections under Clean Air Act (CAA) Tier III regulations (hereafter referred to as “CAA2025”) out to the year 2025 and then constant to 2100, and (3) return to pre‐European N deposition (hereafter referred to as “Return to PE”), represented by 0.4 kg N/ha across the entire study region.</p>
