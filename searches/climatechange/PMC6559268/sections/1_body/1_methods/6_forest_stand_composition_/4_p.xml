<p class="p">Second, to prevent individual trees from growing beyond observed sizes, all trees were modeled to stop growing (i.e., individual tree growth of a species was set to 0 kg/yr) once they reached the largest recorded biomass for their species within the USFS FIA database. However, only 0.3–0.5% of the trees within our study reached their species‐specific maximum biomass and ceased growth during the 2005–2100 period.</p>
