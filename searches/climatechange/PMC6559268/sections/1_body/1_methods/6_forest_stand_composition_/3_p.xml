<p class="p">In addition to the above model details, several other conditions or factors regarding the forest composition model should be noted. First, to isolate the effect of N deposition and climate change on the composition of a single cohort of trees through time, forest composition projections were made under the assumption that forest area would remain constant over the 95‚Äêyr study periods (i.e., there would be no gain or loss of forested area due to harvesting urbanization, abandonment, or other factors). With continuing population growth in the area and the attendant competing demands for land, this assumption may overstate future forest area, biomass, and ecosystem services. For example, the 2010 USFS Resource Planning Act (RPA) Assessment estimated that 8% of forest land could be lost nationally by 2060 based on the conditions of the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) A2 development scenario (USDA Forest Service
