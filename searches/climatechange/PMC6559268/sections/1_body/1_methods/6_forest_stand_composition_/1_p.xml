<p class="p">To model changes in forest stand composition for a single mixed‐age cohort of trees, we applied the species‐specific growth and survival equations, which are described and parameterized in Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), to the individual trees in the tree database. These equations related two responses (i.e., annual tree growth and decadal probability of survival over 5 yr) at the individual tree level to four main factors: tree starting size, total annual precipitation, average annual temperature, and average annual N deposition at the plot location. For each scenario, annual changes in biomass were estimated for 24 tree species in the 19‐state study area over the time period from 2005 to 2100. The 24 modeled species represent the most common species across the study area (Thomas et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For consistency with Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), annual N deposition, temperature, and precipitation estimates from the scenarios were represented as running 10‐yr averages calculated each year, and survival was calculated each year as a 5‐yr probability. The probability estimates were then divided by five to provide annual estimates of survival. Individual tree biomass and number of surviving individuals at the end of one year served as the starting condition of the following year.
