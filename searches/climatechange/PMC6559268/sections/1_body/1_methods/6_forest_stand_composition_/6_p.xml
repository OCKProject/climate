<p class="p">Third, as described earlier, the Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) growth and survival relationships were only developed for trees (i.e., trees with stems &gt;12.7 cm of diameter at a height of 1.3 m), and it was not possible to include the recruitment of new trees and the growth and survival of seedlings in our model. Therefore, only a single cohort of trees was modeled in our study (i.e., only the trees present in the tree database in 2005). We discuss the implications of this in the discussion section.
