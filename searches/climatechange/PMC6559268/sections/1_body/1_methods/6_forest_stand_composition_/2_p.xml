<p class="p">Following the calculation of individual tree biomass and survival each year using the Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) equations, the values were subsequently expanded to the county level (for each county in the study region) through the FIA expansion factors to provide estimates of forest composition biomass and stem counts from 2005 to 2100. Thus, the forest composition model predicted changes through time in the number of surviving trees of the current northeastern forest cohort (starting in 2003) and their associated biomass. It was not possible to model or include regeneration or ingrowth of new trees and multiple cohorts in this current study, as the Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) growth and survival relationships were only developed for trees greater than 12.7 cm at breast height. (1.3 m). Future efforts underway may develop and include models for tree regeneration/recruitment in response to climate and deposition.
