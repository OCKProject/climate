 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) empirical ranges for a species, annual growth and survival were modeled to continue at the rate associated with the upper or lower limit for that variable. As the future scenarios progressively deviated from the current deposition and climate conditions, the proportion of trees reaching the upper or lower limits of their empirical ranges of N deposition, temperature, and precipitation increased. The implications of these restrictions are described in
