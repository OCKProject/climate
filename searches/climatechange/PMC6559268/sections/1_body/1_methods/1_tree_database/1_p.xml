<p class="p">A tree database was assembled to produce an initial, starting forest cohort of trees for the study. This database consists of tree data from U.S. Forest Service (USFS) Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) monitoring plots located in 19‐state study area in the northeastern United States delineated by Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The study area was selected for consistency with the tree growth and survival relationships developed by Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and because the northeastern region of the United States is an area with historically high levels of N deposition. Within this area, a total of 26,895 plots were selected for the database that met a series of criteria: (1) had at least two measurements between 2000 and 2011, (2) was not planted (i.e., naturally regenerated), and (3) current stand did not have evidence of harvesting, silvicultural treatment, or significant disturbance (i.e., damage from insects, disease, fire, or extreme weather) since the last measurement. Within these plots, only data for “trees” were included in the database (total of 527,529 trees), where trees are defined as having a stem diameter of &gt;5 inches (12.7 cm), for the 24 species modeled by Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, the trees selected for analysis represented re‐measured forest trees grown under unmanaged and relatively undisturbed conditions. Total biomass (aboveground) of each tree was then estimated using the measured FIA tree diameters and allometric biomass equations used by Jenkins et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). These species‐specific biomass equations are applicable to all trees with greater than a 2.5 cm diameter. Each tree within the database was treated as “representative” of trees within the forest type throughout the county where the FIA plot was found, and plot‐level total tree counts and individual tree biomass estimates were expanded to the county level using the FIA database tree‐ and plot‐specific expansion factors and equations (O'Connell et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). In summary, the initial, starting unmanaged forest condition within the tree database (hereafter referred to as the “2005 forest condition” to represent a common starting year for the forest composition model simulations), consisted of a total of ~15 billion trees and 6.3 billion metric tons (MT) of total biomass across the 19‐state area.
