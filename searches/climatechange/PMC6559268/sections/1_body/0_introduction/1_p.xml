<p class="p">Growth in human populations and economic activity over the last century have contributed to large increases in emissions of nitrogen (N) compounds and greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. As a result, N deposition from anthropogenic sources across the globe has increased by more almost threefold over historical levels (Fowler

 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), it remains 2–10 times above pre‐settlement levels. In addition, average global surface temperatures have steadily risen since the early 1900s (Cramer et al.

Both individually and interactively, these stressors have had wide ranging impacts on the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems, including alterations in species distribution and diversity of trees within forested ecosystems (Parmesan

 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Inevitably, changes in the relative abundance of different tree species within these forests can impact the benefits that humans receive, both directly and indirectly, from these natural systems (Clark et al.
