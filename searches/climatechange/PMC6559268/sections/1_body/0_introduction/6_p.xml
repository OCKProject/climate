<p class="p">The second objective was to estimate how ecosystem services provided by the current cohort of trees may change over the course of the 95‐yr period. Given that climate and N deposition can each have diverse effects on species composition that may be synergistic or antagonistic, it is expected that some services may be augmented by these combined effects while others may diminish. In this study, we focused our evaluation on three commonly cited services provided by forests: provisioning services provided merchantable timber, regulating services provided by C sequestration, and tree diversity, which is a surrogate for many individual services (Schuldt
