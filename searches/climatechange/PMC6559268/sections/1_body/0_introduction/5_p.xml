<p class="p">To advance understanding of these impacts, this study had two main objectives. The first objective was to project changes in forest composition in response to future changes in N deposition and climate conditions by using previously derived empirical relationships between these factors and the growth and survival of individual tree species (Thomas et al. 
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Using these species‐specific response estimates, we modeled changes in the composition of a single mixed‐age cohort of trees from 2005 to 2100 under alternative deposition–climate futures. Because Thomas et al. (
 <xref rid="ecm1345-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) found large variation across species in both the direction and magnitude of responses to changing N deposition and climate, we expected to see substantial differences in forest composition under the different scenarios.
