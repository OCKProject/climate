<p class="p">The importance of understanding the impacts of N deposition and climate on forests is underscored by the vital and diverse role that forest ecosystems play as a natural asset that can provide many different ecosystem services to human populations (Ninan and Inoue

Forests offer “provisioning services” by providing a wide variety of natural products that are directly used and often extracted by humans to provide sustenance, protection, and health. Forests also offer “cultural” services by providing natural environments that humans value for recreational, aesthetic, spiritual, educational, and other uses, and they provide “regulating” services through their role in natural processes that control and maintain the quantity and quality of air, water, climate, wildlife, and soil‐based resources. The level and types of ecosystem services provided by these assets depend, in many ways, on the types and distribution of tree species contained within these natural systems. Forests also provide “supporting services” such as nutrient cycling, which are needed for the production of all other ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment
