 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>) with high-resolution topographic light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to update projections of RSLR rate and develop revised inundation risk maps. To this end, we apply an approach similar to that of Knowles (

  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>) but consider various probabilistic projections for the likely range (that is, 67% probability) of SLR under different emission and global warming scenarios (table S1). We also consider a recent scenario, referred to as H++, under which higher rates of Antarctica and Greenland ice loss will develop throughout the second half of the 21st century (

 </xref>). The baseline for these SLR projections is the average relative sea level during the period 1991–2009 (

 </xref>). We compiled more than 850 1 km × 1 km tiles of a DEM generated from airborne LiDAR measurements with an average spatial resolution of 1 to 2 m and estimated error of 0.1 to 0.2 m, covering the entire SFBA coastal areas (fig. S4). The DEM heights are given in the North American Vertical Datum of 1988. The DEMs and estimated LLS rates are interpolated on a regular grid of 2 m. We examine two sets of inundation forecast scenarios, one of which considers only the effect of SLR and the other includes the effect of LLS in addition to SLR. To obtain an estimate of LLS by 2100, we extrapolate the observed 2007–2010 LLS rates using a linear function. The formal SD associated with this extrapolation is less than 5 cm in 2100 (fig. S5), well below SLR projection and DEM errors; thus, we do not account for them when we evaluate the uncertainties of inundation hazard. However, the assumption of constant compaction rates over the 21st century requires some discussion. For the Holocene Bay mud deposits of variable thickness, which formed since the post ice-age SLR, these first-order compaction calculations (fig. S6) (
