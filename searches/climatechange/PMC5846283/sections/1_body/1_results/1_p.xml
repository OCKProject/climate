<p class="p">Tide gauge measurements in the SFBA dating back to 1850 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) show a positive trend, indicating an RSLR at an average rate of ~2mm/year. To characterize the LLS and its contribution to RSLR in the SFBA, we first combine large sets of SAR data with repeated measurements of horizontal GNSS positions to obtain accurate, high-resolution, and multitemporal measurements of the three-dimensional (3D) surface deformation field across the SFBA relative to a local reference point (GNSS station LUTZ). The SAR data sets, spanning from 13 July 2007 to 17 October 2010, include 32, 24, and 19 images in descending and ascending orbits of the Environmental Satellite (Envisat) C-band satellite and ascending orbit of the Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS) L-band satellite, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref> and table S2). This period is chosen because data sets from three different viewing geometries are available. Using these data sets, we generate more than 650 differential interferograms (see Methods). Least squares joint inversion of this large interferometric data set with observations from a dense GNSS network allows for resolving the 3D deformation field at 100-m ground resolution and 1 to 10 mm/year precision level.
