 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref> (A to C) shows the obtained E, N, and U velocities relative to GNSS station LUTZ at the location of 379,286 elite pixels. The maps of E and N velocities are dominated by the long wavelength signal due to shear-strain accumulation across the San Andreas Fault system and short-wavelength deformation associated with shallow creep along the Hayward Fault. The comparison with horizontal velocities of 29 GNSS checkpoints relative to LUTZ yields an SD of 2.19 and 2.34 mm/year for the difference between estimated E and N velocities, respectively. For the comparison, we average the measurements of pixels within 250-m distance of a given GNSS station. The time series of E, N, and U displacements with respect to LUTZ are further validated using observations of four continuous GNSS stations (locations shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>), for which we find good agreement between the GNSS- and InSAR-derived time series (fig. S3).
