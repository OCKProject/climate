<p class="p">The potential inundation maps due to SLR alone and a combination of LLS and SLR for the upper bound of the likely range of RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 scenarios are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> (A and B). The former scenario corresponds to the goals of the 2015 Paris agreement, whereas the latter considers the scenario that no effort is made to mitigate and remove emissions. Corresponding results for the other SLR scenarios, provided in table S1, are shown in figs. S7 to S15. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3C</xref> also summarizes the potential inundated areas for the ranges of considered SLR projections with and without accounting for LLS. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows examples of areas subject to significant inundation by 2100. The extents of areas that will be inundated because of either LLS or SLR alone, as well as their combined effect, are shown, amplifying the extent of inundated area. We find that SLR alone poses a significant inundation risk to coastal urban areas and infrastructures, as well as ecologically valuable marshes and wetlands (

 </xref>). Considering the lower and upper bounds of likely ranges of various RCP-projected SLR scenarios and LLS, we estimate that, in 2100, an area of 98 to 218 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> will be affected by RSLR. The corresponding values for the case of SLR only are 51 to 168 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Considering the H++ scenario, an area of 413 to 429 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> will be vulnerable to inundation (fig. S15). Even if SLR was completely halted, LLS alone would put 45 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> at risk. Thus, a much larger area will be affected by inundation once the effect of LLS is taken into account, especially for the more modest SLR scenarios. Considering the full range of various RCP scenarios and the H++ one, we estimate that the maps of potential inundation based solely on SLR projections for the SFBA underestimate the affected land area by 3.7 to 90.9%. These estimates are conservative, in that high tides, storm events, and high-precipitation periods can substantially raise the water level above that obtained from projections of SLR.
