<p class="p">The map of vertical velocities shows a complex pattern of uplift and subsidence across the SFBA. Most of the Pacific shorelines and areas adjacent to the San Francisco Bay are subject to subsidence at less than ~2 mm/year. Portions of Treasure Island, San Francisco, San Francisco International Airport, and Foster City are subsiding as fast as 10 mm/year (
