<p class="p">Major consequences of exacerbated inundation risk for coastal areas include saltwater contamination of surface and underground waters, accelerated coastal erosion, wetland losses, and increased flooding, which may lead to unprecedented socioeconomic impacts (

 </xref>) estimate that, in California by 2100, more than 480,000 people and $100 billion worth of property will be exposed to flood risk caused by SLR. Worldwide in 2005, more than 40 million people lived in coastal areas prone to 100-year flood risk; this number will grow more than threefold by 2070, and the value of property exposed to flooding will increase to ~9% of the projected global gross domestic product, with the United States, Japan, and Netherlands being the countries with most exposure (

 </xref>). As we demonstrate, coastal subsidence can significantly increase this exposure. The framework presented here to account for coastal land subsidence is transferable to other coastal cities and can be used to inform policy decisions affecting coastal activities. Global climate change is affecting the future inundation risks both through accelerating ice sheet melting (increasing the rate of SLR) and through more intense droughts, leading to unprecedented groundwater overdraft (
