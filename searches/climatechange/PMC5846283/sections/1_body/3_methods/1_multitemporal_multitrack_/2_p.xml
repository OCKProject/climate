<p class="p">Each data set was processed separately to generate three accurate and high-resolution time series of surface deformation. To this end, we applied the wavelet-based InSAR (WabInSAR) algorithm (

The time series of complex interferometric phase noise was then calculated in the wavelet domain and analyzed in a statistical framework to identify elite (that is, less noisy) pixels. The absolute estimate of the phase change for elite pixels was obtained via an iterative 2D sparse phase unwrapping algorithm. Each unwrapped interferogram was corrected for the effect of orbital error (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>) and the topography-correlated component of atmospheric delay (
 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">37</italic>
 </xref>). Using a robust regression, the phase changes from the large set of interferograms were inverted. This approach reduced the effects of outliers due to improper phase unwrapping. A high-pass filter, using continuous wavelet transforms, was applied to reduce the temporal component of the atmospheric delay. Lastly, we geocoded all data sets to obtain precise locations of elite pixels in a geographic reference frame. Figure S1 shows the line-of-sight (LOS) velocity associated with each data set.
