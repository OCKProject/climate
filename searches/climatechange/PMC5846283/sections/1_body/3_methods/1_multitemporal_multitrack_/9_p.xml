 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> (A to C), which are obtained from applying the WabInSAR-3D approach to 68 SAR images acquired by Envisat and ALOS satellites, together with horizontal velocities of 26 GNSS tie points, which are randomly selected. We obtained an SD of 2.19 and 2.34 mm/year, comparing the estimated E and N velocities, with horizontal velocities of 29 GNSS checkpoints not used in the combination. Using observations of four continuous GNSS stations of the BARD network relative to station LUTZ, the time series of E, N, and U displacement were also validated (fig. S3).
