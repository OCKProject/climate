 </sup>as the interpolated time series of displacement and variance for a given pixel. Below, we set up a Kalman filter–based framework to combine these three InSAR time series with horizontal velocities of GNSS data sets (E-W and N-S components) to generate a seamless, high-resolution, and accurate time series of east (E), west (W), and U (vertical) motions. The GNSS velocities were obtained from Bürgmann

 </xref>) that relied on data from both continuous and campaign GNSS measurements. We split this data set into two parts: One group of stations was used to combine with the InSAR data sets (so-called tie points), and the other part was used to validate the results (so-called checkpoints) (
