<p class="p">To validate the WabInSAR-3D approach, we used a synthetic test. To this end, we simulated 3D deformation time series as a combination of a periodic function with a period of 1 year, a Heaviside function with step size of 5 and a linear trend with slopes of 3, 2, and 1 in E, N, and U directions, respectively (fig. S1). Using the geometrical parameters of the three SAR data sets, we projected the simulated 3D displacement field onto the LOS of Envisat descending and ascending and ALOS ascending orbit track, similar to our data set over the SFBA. The simulated LOS time series were inverted to recover the 3D displacement field. We first applied the method presented by Ozawa and Ueda (

 </xref>), which jointly inverted data from different look angles and solved for E and U time series. The top row in fig. S1 shows the results from implementing the Ozawa and Ueda (

 </xref>) approach together with the simulated E, N, and U time series. Using this approach, no N displacement was retrieved because they assumed that its contribution was negligible due to the near-polar orbiting satellites. For the E component, the periodicity, trend, and jump were recovered accurately, owing to multiple look and heading angles. However, the estimated U component is relatively uncertain, the mismatch between simulated and recovered signal increases near the jump, and the error propagates throughout the signal. The bottom row in fig. S1 presents results from applying the WabInSAR-3D. The estimated E component is accurate and matches the simulated signal slightly better than that of Ozawa and Ueda (

  <italic class="italic">41</italic>
 </xref>). For the N component, WabInSAR-3D is able to at least retrieve the trend and slight periodicity, but the jump is lost. The estimated U component here shows a significant improvement over the other approach and retrieves the periodicity, trend, and jump accurately. Now that we have validated WabInSAR-3D using a simulated data set, we applied it to the SAR and GNSS data sets over the SFBA.
