<p class="p">To transfer the vertical velocities from the central local reference frame relative to GNSS station LUTZ into a stable North America reference frame (NA12), we used vertical velocities of four permanent GNSS stations of the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) network that lie in the area of InSAR coverage (

 </xref>), and applied a conformal translation. We found that a scale factor of 1 and uniform shift of 0.25 mm/year were sufficient to firmly tie the results from the combined InSAR and GNSS measurements to the continental reference frame. We obtained an SD of 0.52 mm/year for the transferred U velocity map in the NA12 reference frame to the four PBO stations.
