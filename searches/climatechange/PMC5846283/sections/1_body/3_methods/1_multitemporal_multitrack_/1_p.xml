<p class="p">The SAR data sets spanning from 13 July 2007 to 17 October 2010 include 32, 24, and 19 images in descending (incidence angle = 23°, heading angle = 193°) and ascending (incidence angle = 23°, heading angle = 350°) orbits of the Envisat C-band satellite and ascending (incidence angle = 34.5°, heading angle = 350°) orbit of ALOS L-band satellite, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and table S2). This period was chosen because data sets from three different geometries were available. Using these data sets, we generated 428, 151, and 77 interferograms, respectively. For the Envisat interferometric data set, the maximum temporal and perpendicular baselines are set to be 3 years and 300 m. The corresponding numbers are 3 years and 1500 m for the ALOS data set.
