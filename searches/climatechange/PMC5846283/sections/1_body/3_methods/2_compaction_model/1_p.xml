<p class="p">Using the 1D compaction model suggested by Kooi and de Vries (

The most rapid subsidence (≫5 mm/year) was found in areas of anthropogenic landfill overlying thick Bay mud deposits, such as the northwest corner of Treasure Island where ~10-m-thick fill overlies &gt;20-m-thick Bay mud (

 </xref>). Here, we can draw on leveling data capturing the early phases of secondary compaction (
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>). Most of the compaction of the fill material was completed within less than 5 years after placement in 1936–1937. By 1960, the secondary compaction of the underlying Bay mud continued at a rate of ~20 mm/year (

  <italic class="italic">42</italic>
 </xref>). Subsidence rates in the northwest of Treasure Island relative to nearby bedrock on Yerba Buena Island had decayed to ~10 mm/year by 2000 (
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">43</italic>
 </xref>) and still amounted to ~6 to 10 mm/year in our 2007–2010 data set. In these areas of recent fill emplacement, our linear extrapolation may overestimate the expected LLS in 2100 by 5 to 14%, assuming a sediment thickness of 10 to 30 m.
