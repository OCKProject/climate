  <p class="p">The lower and upper bounds of the likely ranges (67% probability) for projected SLR under various RCPs are considered (see table S1). In each scenario, we consider only SLR (yellow) and the combined effect of SLR and LLS (red). (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Area that will be inundated in 2100 considering the upper bound of SLR projection under RCP 2.6 scenario, which represents the goals of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Changes 2015 Paris agreement. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) Results using the upper bound of RCP 8.5 projection, under which there will be no significant effort to mitigate or remove emissions. Examples of key areas with significant inundation are marked, and close-ups are shown in

   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Total estimated areas of potential inundation considering the ranges of projected SLR alone (yellow) and the combined effect of SLR and LLS (red) in 2030, 2050, and 2100. Letter labels show the estimates of inundated areas shown in (A) and (B).
