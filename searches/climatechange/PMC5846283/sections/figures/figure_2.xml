Circles show location of continuous GNSS station used for validating 3D displacement field time series shown in fig. S3. Note that for sake of visualization, the scattered data points are interpolated on a regular grid using an inverse distance interpolation algorithm, which causes a somewhat patchy appearance. The background in (D) is a shaded relief generated from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc sec digital elevation model (DEM) (
