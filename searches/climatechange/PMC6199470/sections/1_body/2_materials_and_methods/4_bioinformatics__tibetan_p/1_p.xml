<p class="p">Only sequences &gt;200 bp long with an average quality score &gt;25 and no ambiguous characters were included in the analyses (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). Filtering of the sequences to remove sequence errors and chimeras was conducted using the USEARCH tool in QIIME (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>), version 1.9.0. Phylotypes were identified using the open-frame method Uclust (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>) and assigned to OTUs defined at â‰¥97% sequence identity. A representative sequence was chosen from each OTU by selecting the most highly connected sequence. All representative sequences were aligned by PyNAST (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>). Taxonomic identity of each OTU was determined using the Greengenes database (
