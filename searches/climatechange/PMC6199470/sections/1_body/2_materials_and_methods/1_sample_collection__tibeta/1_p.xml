<p class="p">To survey current bacterial and archaeal distributions across the Tibetan Plateau, we collected 180 surface soil samples from 60 sites throughout the Tibetan Plateau during the growing season (July to September) of 2011. At each site, we sampled three plots 40 m apart, and collected 5 to 7 cores per plot at a depth of 0 to 5 cm, which were subsequently combined. Our sampling locations covered more than 1,000,000 km

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1F</xref> in the supplemental material) and all of the major climate zones and grassland types across the Tibetan Plateau (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1F</xref>). All soil samples were delivered by cooler equipped with ice packs (4°C) to the laboratory as quickly as possible, where they were stored at −20°C until processing. In addition, all vegetation in three plots (1 × 1 m

At each site, one soil pit was excavated to collect samples for analyses of bulk density. From this pit, three replicate soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 5 cm. Bulk density was obtained using a standard container with 100 cm
