<p class="p">Total nucleic acids from each plot were extracted from 0.5 g of soil using a FastDNA Spin kit (Bio 101, Carlsbad, CA, USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and stored at −40°C. Extracted DNA was diluted to approximately 25 ng/μl with distilled water and stored at −20°C until use. A 2-μl diluted DNA sample of each plot was used as the template for amplification. The V4-V5 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNAs (
 <named-content content-type="genus-species" class="named-content">Escherichia coli</named-content> positions 515 to 907) were amplified using the primer set F515 (GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGG) with the Roche 454 A pyrosequencing adapter and a unique 7-bp barcode sequence, and primer R907 (CCGTCAATTCMTTTRAGTTT) with the Roche 454 B sequencing adapter at the 5′ end of each primer, respectively. Each sample was amplified in triplicate with a 50-μl reaction mixture under the following conditions: 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 30 s, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products from each sample were pooled and purified with an agarose gel DNA purification kit (TaKaRa), combined in equimolar ratios in a single tube, and run on a Roche FLX454 pyrosequencing machine (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Branford, CT), producing reads from the forward direction F515.
