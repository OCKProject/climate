<p class="p">For assessing whether historical or current climate is more predictive of current prokaryotic distributions, we utilized global maps of monthly historical climate records from the 0.5-degree gridded CRU TS3.21 data set (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). The CRU TS3.21 data set spans 1901 to 2014, but we used only records postdating 1950, because in the Tibetan Plateau and North America, records prior to then are based on substantially more interpolation (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). We considered the following climate variables: frost day frequency, potential evapo-transpiration, daily mean temperature, monthly average daily minimum temperature, monthly average daily maximum temperature, vapor pressure, wet day frequency, cloud cover, diurnal temperature range, and precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">TableÂ S1G</xref>). We considered 10- and 20-year climatologies (i.e., summaries over one or two decades) for each of these variables as predictors, but use of both climatologies yielded qualitatively similar results, so we focused on results with 10-year climatologies overlapping by 5 years (decades ending on December 31 of 2009, 2004, 1999, 1994, 1989, 1984, 1979, 1974, 1969, 1964, and 1959). Inclusion of even more time-specific climate data (e.g., from the month of sample collection) did not improve model performance. To test associations with contemporary climate, we used the average conditions from the year (January 1 to December 31) when samples were collected (2011 in Tibet and 2005 in northern North America). We performed principal-component analysis (PCA) on these variables across all climatologies and locations separately in Tibet and North America. In this PCA, each location-time period combination is an observation and each of the 10 climate measurements is a variable. These data were centered and scaled before performing the singular value decomposition step of PCA. We performed subsequent analyses using the projections of the location-time period observations onto the first three principal component axes (see Results and Discussion).
