<p class="p">Surface soil samples for C and N analyses were air-dried, sieved (2-mm mesh), handpicked to remove fine roots, and ground. Total soil C and N contents for each plot were determined by combustion (2400 II CHNS/0 Elemental Analyzer, Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA, USA). Soil moisture was measured gravimetrically after a 10-h desiccation at 105°C. Soil pH was determined separately on each plot at each site with a fresh soil-to-water ratio of 1:5 by pH monitor (Thermo Orion-868). Bulk density was calculated as the ratio of the oven-dry soil mass to the container volume. Dissolved organic carbon, dissolved total nitrogen (DTN), ammonium nitrogen (NH
