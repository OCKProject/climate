<p class="p">To predict how prokaryotic communities would shift if they were to equilibrate to contemporary climate, we substituted contemporary climate data (most recent 10-year climatology) into the models selected above, many of which used climate data from prior to 1980. To estimate shifts in diversity and relative abundance, we took the difference between future predictions and contemporary predictions (as opposed to the difference between future predictions and contemporary observations); this procedure avoided spurious correlations that can arise from the nonzero covariance that always exists between residuals and observed values. We used Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface (MESS [
