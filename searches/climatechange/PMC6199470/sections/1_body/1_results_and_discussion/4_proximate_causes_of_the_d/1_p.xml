<p class="p">The disequilibrium between prokaryotic distributions and contemporary climate is likely due to the soil properties being out of equilibrium with contemporary climate, which occurs for a variety of reasons (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). To explore this hypothesis, we analyzed correlations of current surface soil properties with patterns of prokaryotic diversity at the locations that we sampled in the Tibetan Plateau. Soil factors, such as dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N), were significantly correlated with OTU richness, while soil moisture, C:N, pH, and various forms of both nitrogen and carbon were significantly correlated with community structure (false discovery rate &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1</xref>D and E). In some other studies at this scale, pH had a strong association with soil prokaryotic richness (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>), particularly in acidic soils (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>) and when a wide range of pH values is observed. However, at sampling locations in this study, the soil C:N was more important, being negatively correlated with richness (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1D</xref>) and community structure (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity; 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.44, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.001) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1E</xref>). C:N is also the best predictor of the relative abundance of some, but not all, individual taxa. The high altitude and low temperatures on the plateau reduce C degradation rates and lead to N limitation (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>), resulting in elevated C:N ratios and high inorganic C in dry areas. Soil moisture, which correlated with C:N, showed similar associations with richness and community composition (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">B</xref>, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1D</xref>). The relative abundances of specific taxa have both negative (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>) and positive (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic>) correlations with C:N ratio and soil moisture (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4" class="xref">Fig. S4B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4" class="xref">C</xref>). We found that C:N ratios are more closely associated with historical rather than contemporary climate (climatology of strongest association: 1960–1969), suggesting a mechanism through which prokaryotic distributions are out of equilibrium with contemporary climate: distributions of soil properties lag behind shifts in climate, which in turn cause the distributions of bacteria and archaea to lag.
