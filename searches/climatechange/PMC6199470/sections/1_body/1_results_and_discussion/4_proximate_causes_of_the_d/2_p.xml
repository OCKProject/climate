<p class="p">To explore associations between vegetation and soil prokaryotic communities, we recorded all plants in plots adjacent to each sampling location and tested for associations between each plant and prokaryotic diversity and abundance statistics. Unfortunately, very few plant species were prevalent enough to perform this testing or predictive modeling. Analysis of the prevalent plants did not identify significant associations, suggesting that current plants are not drivers of current prokaryotic communities or that we lacked power to detect such associations. We also are unable to test for associations with historic plant distributions, since we lack these data. Hence, our results collectively suggest a relationship between prokaryotic distributions and specific soil properties, but not current vegetation. But we cannot rule out the possibility that lagging distributions of vegetation directly contribute to the lagged relationship of prokaryotes to climate and/or affect soil properties that then shape prokaryotic distributions. Future experimental or longitudinal studies could explore these questions and also investigate whether bacteria and archaea are inherently slow to respond to climate change, irrespective of changes to soil and plants.</p>
