<p class="p">We profiled bacterial and archaeal community structure using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing from 180 surface soil samples across 60 locations in the Tibetan Plateau and obtained a total of 926,609 reads (median = 5,247 per sample, range = 3,016 to 9,926 per sample). These communities had 65,874 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and were dominated by nine phyla (see
