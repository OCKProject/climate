<p class="p">We obtained monthly maps of 10 climate variables across the plateau at 0.5-degree resolution from 1950 to 2012 (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). To dampen noise from short-term fluctuations, for each climate variable, we created climatologies by averaging values at our sampling locations over 10-year sliding windows. Results from 20-year climatologies were qualitatively similar. We refer to the 10-year climatologies by the dates that they span (e.g., 1950–1959 climatology averages climate data from 1950 to 1959). We also calculated 1-year climatologies from the year when samples were collected to account for effects of contemporary climate. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) jointly on all the climatologies (historical and current) and found that the first three principal components cumulatively account for 88.1% of variation (54.4% PC1, 23.3% PC2, and 10.4% PC3) while reducing its dimensionality, which is key for model selection in the following analyses. For most time periods, temperature mean is highly weighted in PC1, precipitation mean in PC2, and temperature range in PC3. In order to make all-subset model selection computationally feasible, we use the projections onto the first three principal components (three values for each time period and geographic location) in lieu of the full climate data matrix (ten values for each time period and geographic location), referring to these PCA-based summaries of the climatologies as “climate variables.”
