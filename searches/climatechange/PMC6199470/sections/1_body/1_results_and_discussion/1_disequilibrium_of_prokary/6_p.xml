<p class="p">We next considered several factors that could have biased our results. We concluded that our findings cannot be explained by climate cycling, because most climate variables have trended consistently over this period (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS1" class="xref">Fig. S1F</xref>). Moreover, anthropogenic impacts other than climate change (e.g., land use change or pollution) are unlikely to have generated the disequilibria because the surface samples we analyzed are from undisturbed soils and anthropogenic impacts cannot account for the associations between current prokaryotic distributions and historic climatic conditions that persist even after the associations with current climate have been taken into account. However, because we considered only climate postdating 1950, we cannot exclude the possibility that climates from prior to 1950 are predictive or that legacy effects are longer than 50 years. Finally, we expect our results to be robust to the fact that soil communities were sampled at only one time during the year based on prior literature on this topic (
