<p class="p">To assess whether the soil prokaryotic communities are in equilibrium with contemporary climate in the Tibetan Plateau, we built a regression model of OTU richness (number of OTUs) as a function of historical and contemporary climate variables. By performing all-subset model selection in which climate variables from different time periods compete with each other based on how well they can explain variation in OTU richness across sampling locations, we assessed the extent to which the contemporary distribution of prokaryotic diversity is associated with historic and contemporary climate (Materials and Methods). We also performed analogous analyses to assess correlations of contemporary and historical climate with Shannon diversity (evenness of OTUs) and with relative abundance of each prevalent bacterial family (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 53) and OTU (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 317) found in 40 or more soil samples. No archaea met this prevalence threshold.
