<p class="p">Soil prokaryotic distributions that are significantly correlated with the climate from several decades ago as opposed to the climate from the time of sampling could be explained by distributions that are out of equilibrium with contemporary climate, among other potential contributing forces (see below). Consistent with this, climate from before 1974 predicted contemporary prokaryotic richness (i.e., was frequently chosen over many iterations of model selection in models with different numbers of variables as quantified by the Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold statistic [LMG] [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]): 1960–1969 PC1 LMG = 0.183, 1960–1969 PC3 LMG = 0.202. Contemporary climate variables were also predictive: 2002–2011 PC2 LMG = 0.415, 2002–2011 PC3 LMG = 0.200. In contrast, intervening years’ climatologies were less often chosen during model selection. Contemporary Shannon diversity is highly correlated with richness and hence is also predicted by both historic and contemporary climate. For models to predict the relative abundance of prevalent families and OTUs, the importance of climate across the decades spanning 1959 to 2012 was substantial and consistent (

However, the frequency with which climate variables from different decades were predictive was bimodal: both historic variables from circa 1969 and contemporary variables were frequently predictive of the distributions of families and OTUs, while variables from circa 1980 were less frequently predictive (i.e., less often chosen in model selection) (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2B</xref>). This bimodality held quite generally across different climate variables for both OTUs (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2C</xref>). Furthermore, contemporary distributions of families and OTUs were often simultaneously associated with both historic and contemporary climate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2D</xref>). These results suggest that contemporary distributions of the diversity of soil prokaryotes and of individual taxa are associated with climate from today and from close to 50 years ago, or potentially earlier, as our results cannot rule out effects from before the time period we investigated.
