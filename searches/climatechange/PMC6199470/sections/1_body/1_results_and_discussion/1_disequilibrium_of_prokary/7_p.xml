<p class="p">To evaluate the extent to which our findings might be influenced by modeling choices, we conducted two robustness analyses. First, we performed regression modeling with the original climate variables rather than projections onto principal components, using a modified model selection procedure because all-subset selection is computationally prohibitive on 120 climatologies (10 variables Ã— 12 time periods per location; see Materials and Methods). Second, we repeated our investigation of the association between climate and prokaryotic distributions using gradient boosting rather than standard regression. Conclusions from both of these alternative approaches were highly concordant with our primary findings, indicating that our results are not artifacts of a particular model or way to quantify climate data.</p>
