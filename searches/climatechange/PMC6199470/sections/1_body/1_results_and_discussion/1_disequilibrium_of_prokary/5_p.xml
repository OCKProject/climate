<p class="p">Historical climate may be an important predictor of contemporary prokaryotic distributions because soil edaphic characteristics often follow historic conditions (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Indeed, we applied the same modeling procedure used for family/OTU abundance to predict current soil characteristics as a function of climate, allowing climatologies from different decades to compete in the model selection procedure. We found that historical climate variables were more predictive than current climate of soil edaphic characteristics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>) and that five key soil edaphic characteristics (dissolved organic nitrogen, soil organic carbon, total carbon, dissolved organic carbon, and total nitrogen) were particularly strongly correlated with climate from before 1980 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS4" class="xref">Fig. S4A</xref>). Even though most soil microbes likely have short generation times, the diversity and composition of soil microbial communities appear to be strongly influenced by soil properties that change slowly over time (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Like the microbial communities, these soil properties are out of equilibrium with contemporary climate.
