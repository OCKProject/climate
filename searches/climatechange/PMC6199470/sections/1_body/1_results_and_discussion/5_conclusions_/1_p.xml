<p class="p">Soil prokaryotes appear to follow soil characteristics in showing a significant lagged response to a changing climate across many decades, a pattern evident across both the Tibetan Plateau and northern North American. If bacteria and archaea could equilibrate to existing climate change, our models predict that widespread increases in diversity and shifts in community composition would occur. While it is tempting to speculate about broader impacts of these changes, inferring the functional consequences of soil microbial community differences is challenging (
