<p class="p">Despite these similarities, we observed several important differences between our models for northern North America and the Tibetan Plateau. In northern North America, changes in richness after equilibration to current climate would be uncorrelated with current richness (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS9" class="xref">Fig. S9C</xref>), although changes in Shannon diversity would be negatively associated with current Shannon diversity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS9" class="xref">Fig. S9D</xref>). Furthermore, prevalent bacterial families and OTUs would generally have the greatest changes in relative abundance in locations where they are currently rare (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7" class="xref">Fig. S7G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8" class="xref">S8D</xref>), although the distribution of future intersample differences in relative abundance is similar to current intersample differences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7" class="xref">Fig. S7H</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8" class="xref">S8E</xref>), suggesting that overall many pairs of samples will maintain greater difference in diversity than forecasted for the Tibetan Plateau, where some moderate homogenization of diversity is predicted. This may be due in part to the fact that the magnitude of predicted diversity changes is much larger for low-diversity sites in the Tibetan Plateau (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>) than for North America (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS9" class="xref">Fig. S9C</xref>). The most striking difference between the regions is that individual taxa have very different forecast changes in their distributions (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.053 for correlation, between regions, of fraction of locations where families would increase). For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Beijerinckiaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteriaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Acidobacteria</italic>) are predicted to increase in relative abundance in most locations of northern North America (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1C</xref>), while 
 <italic class="italic">Methylobacteriaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Cellulomonadaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>) are predicted to decrease. Thus, our results demonstrate different responses among specific bacterial taxa and between Tibetan Plateau and North America despite parallel trends toward higher diversity.
