<p class="p">To assess whether the predicted responses of Tibetan Plateau soils to climate change are similar to those for other regions of Earth and at larger spatial scales, we performed similar analyses using historic climate data and published surface soil prokaryotic community data from 84 locations across northern North America (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6" class="xref">Fig. S6A</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Several of the major trends from the Tibetan Plateau were also observed in northern North America. First, historical climate variables were strong predictors of taxon abundance and diversity metrics. For instance, soil prokaryotic richness was predicted by 1960–1969 climatologies in both regions (in northern North America, LMG for 1960–1969 PC2 and PC3 0.057 and 0.227, respectively, with LMG for PC1 in 1975–1984 = 0.716). Second, across families and OTUs, relative abundances were commonly predicted by both historical and contemporary climate in northern North America (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7" class="xref">Fig. S7A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7" class="xref">B</xref>). When they were included via model selection, historical climate variables were important predictors (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS7" class="xref">Fig. S7C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8" class="xref">S8A</xref>). Furthermore, historical values of most climate variables were predictive (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS8" class="xref">S8B</xref>). Finally, when these models were projected to contemporary climate, the forecast outcomes of equilibration were similar to those in the Tibetan Plateau: richness and Shannon diversity would increase across 76.0% and 73.0% of samples, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS6" class="xref">Fig. S6B</xref>). Projecting maps of the increases in richness, these increases in richness would be geographically widespread (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Projected shifts in diversity and OTU relative abundance are within the range of current intersample differences in these quantities, while projected shifts in family relative abundance are mostly lower than current intersample differences (
