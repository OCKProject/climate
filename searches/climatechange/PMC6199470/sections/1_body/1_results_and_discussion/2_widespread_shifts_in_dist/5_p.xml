<p class="p">Our forecasts of shifts with equilibration to existing climate assume temporal niche conservatism, which means that bacteria and archaea are associated similarly with environmental conditions over time, as they equilibrate to changes. We also assume that the taxa we detected in each region will move into new locations or out of current locations (and similarly, alter their relative abundances at different locations) in accordance with their niche preferences, which of course depend upon dispersal. Prokaryotes could shift to occupy different niches in the time that it would take their distributions to equilibrate to contemporary climate. Such shifts would depend on rates of adaptation, dispersal, and population growth, among other factors. Incorporating these forces into our models would introduce substantial complexity and numerous assumptions. Thus, our forecasts can be taken as baseline estimates: future analyses that incorporate additional complexity, including evolution, dispersal limitation, and neutral assembly processes, may add to these results.</p>
