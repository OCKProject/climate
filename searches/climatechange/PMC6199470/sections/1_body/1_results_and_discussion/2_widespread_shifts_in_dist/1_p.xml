<p class="p">We next asked whether soil prokaryotic diversity would increase or decrease as communities equilibrated to current climatic conditions. To answer this question, we projected the models, which were fitted with historical and contemporary climate data, to contemporary climate data. Specifically, by inputting 2002–2011 climatology data into the models with best performance (e.g., models utilizing 1960–1969 PC1 and PC3), we forecast how prokaryotic diversity and relative abundance would change if the distributions of bacteria and archaea were to equilibrate to 2002–2011 climatology. To understand the extent of these changes, we sought to answer four specific questions. (i) With equilibration, would diversity and relative abundance predominantly increase, decrease, or remain unchanged across the sampling locations? (ii) How would shifts in diversity and relative abundance compare to existing spatial variation in diversity and relative abundance? (iii) Would locations with currently high diversity or relative abundance experience different changes compared to the locations with low diversity and low relative abundance (i.e., “rich get richer” versus homogenization)? (iv) Would intersample variability increase or decrease in the future?</p>
