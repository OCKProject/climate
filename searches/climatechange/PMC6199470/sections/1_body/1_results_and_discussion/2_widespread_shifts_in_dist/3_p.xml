<p class="p">Further supporting this contention, we used the regression models developed above to forecast how richness would shift if prokaryotic distributions were to equilibrate across the Tibetan Plateau. Specifically, we projected maps of current richness using the historic and contemporary climate conditions that were selected for the models. Using just contemporary climate conditions, we then projected richness maps if prokaryotic distributions were to equilibrate to contemporary climate. These projections (
