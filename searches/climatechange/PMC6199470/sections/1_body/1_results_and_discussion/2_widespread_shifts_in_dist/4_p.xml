<p class="p">Turning to how the relative abundance of individual prevalent prokaryotes might respond to equilibration to current climate, we predicted that (i) that different bacterial taxa would respond heterogeneously: some would increase across all sampling locations, but others would decrease across all sampling locations; the magnitude of changes ranged from nonsignificant to over 100% for different taxa (

 <italic class="italic">Mycobacteriaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rubrobacteraceae</italic> (families of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">Bacillaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Firmicutes</italic>), and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodobiaceae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizobiaceae</italic> (families of 
 <italic class="italic">Alphaproteobacteria</italic>) are predicted to increase consistently in most locations of the plateau, while 
 <italic class="italic">Flavobacteriaceae</italic> (a family of 
 <italic class="italic">Bacteroidetes</italic>), 
 <italic class="italic">Nakamurellaceae</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Nocardiaceae</italic> (families of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinobacteria</italic>) are predicted to decrease in the majority of locations, albeit by modest amounts (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="tabS1" class="xref">Table S1C</xref>). Overall, there was no consistent trend across all families or OTUs (e.g., most families increasing). However, (ii) shifts in relative abundance across taxa would consistently be of similar magnitude as existing intersample differences in relative abundance (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2E</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">F</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3" class="xref">S3B</xref>). That is, the projected changes in community composition are on par with existing intersite variation in communities across the sampled locations. Furthermore, (iii) locations with low relative abundance would experience larger changes than locations with high relative abundance (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2G</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3" class="xref">S3C</xref>). Finally, although the latter shifts could act to even out the spatial distribution of relative abundance, this does not appear to be the case: (iv) with equilibration, intersample differences in relative abundance would be similar to contemporary intersample differences (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS2" class="xref">Fig. S2H</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS3" class="xref">S3D</xref>). Thus, across the Tibetan Plateau, our models predict that different taxa would undergo varying shifts in relative abundance with equilibration.
