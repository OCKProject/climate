<p class="p">We forecast that (i) richness and Shannon diversity would increase across 75% and 72.9% of the sampling locations, respectively, with an average magnitude of +7.5% (standard error, 1.5%) for richness and +2.1% (standard error, 0.4%) for Shannon diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). We further forecast (ii) that shifts in diversity within samples would be of similar magnitude to existing intersample differences in diversity, suggesting major, although not unprecedented, shifts in diversity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5" class="xref">Fig. S5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5" class="xref">B</xref>). We forecast that (iii) locations with low diversity would experience the largest increases in diversity, and locations with high diversity would experience little or no increase in diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5" class="xref">Fig. S5C</xref>). The latter trend might suggest that intersample variation in diversity levels would decrease in the future, and our forecasts do indicate (iv) a moderate decrease in intersample variability in their diversity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5" class="xref">Fig. S5A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="figS5" class="xref">B</xref>; differences in diversity calculated as percent changes between samples or within samples at different time points). These predictions suggest major changes in the spatial distribution of diversity in soil prokaryotic communities across the Tibetan Plateau with equilibration to existing climate change.
