<p class="p">Climate change is disrupting almost all ecosystems on Earth, with widespread effects on plants and animals (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). Continued climate shifts are predicted to exacerbate these effects. But even if climate stabilized today, disruptions to ecosystems would continue for some time. Two examples are the extinction debts of many long-lived, slowly reproducing species whose populations will dwindle in coming years due to environmental shifts that have already occurred (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>) and the colonization lags of species whose ranges are in the process of moving in response to climate change (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). Terrestrial bacteria play fundamental roles in the functioning of ecosystems and the maintenance of soil fertility (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). However, despite the fact that soil bacterial communities and the processes they mediate are often highly sensitive to climate (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>), we have limited knowledge of the effects of climate change on the regional distributions of soil bacteria (
