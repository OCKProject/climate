<p class="p">The Tibetan Plateau provides an ideal location to study legacy effects in soil microbial distributions. Because the plateau is undergoing rapid climate change (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>), many of the factors that drive the distributions of soil microbes, particularly soil properties and plant communities, may still be equilibrating to the current climate. Understanding how climate change will affect Tibetan soil microbial communities is important: the plateau contains a vast soil carbon reservoir (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>) that may become labile due to thawing permafrost and accelerated microbial metabolism (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), and the region actively moderates climate in Asia and across the globe. Also, soil microbes on the Tibetan Plateau are exposed to particularly dry, cold conditions. It is the youngest (∼2.4 × 10
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> years), largest (∼2.0 × 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), and highest (mean ∼4,000 m) plateau in the world. Because the Tibetan Plateau has an extreme and changing climate, we anticipated that modeling equilibration of soil microbial communities in the region to climate change would reveal potentially dramatic shifts.
