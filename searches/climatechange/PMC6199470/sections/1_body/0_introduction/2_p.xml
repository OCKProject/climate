<p class="p">This study investigates the spatial and temporal extent of legacy effects among soil prokaryotes and the consequences of equilibration of soil prokaryotic distributions to contemporary climate. By virtue of their short generation times and dispersal abilities, soil microbes might be expected to respond to climate change quickly and to be effectively in equilibrium with current climatic conditions. However, legacy effects—defined here as community properties that persist after environmental change (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>)—have been observed in soil microbial communities, which take up to 3 years to respond to drought and other environmental shifts (

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]), and because these soil properties change slowly over time, factors driving shifts in soil bacterial communities can reflect historic climate (
