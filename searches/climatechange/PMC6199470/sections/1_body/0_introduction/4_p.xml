<p class="p">To test this hypothesis, we measured bacterial and archaeal community composition in 180 nonagricultural soils from 60 locations across the plateau. We showed that the prokaryotic taxonomic distributions in these soils were closely associated with historic climate (from ∼50 years ago), even after adjusting for contemporary climate. Using models of associations between current prokaryotic communities and historic environmental factors, we predicted that diversity, community structure, and biogeographic patterns would shift substantially with equilibration to contemporary climate. To explore how generally applicable these findings are, we performed analogous analyses with 84 surface soil samples from across the United States and Canada. Our results suggest widespread increases in soil prokaryotic diversity in both regions and region-specific shifts in the distributions of individual taxa if these communities were to equilibrate to current climate conditions.</p>
