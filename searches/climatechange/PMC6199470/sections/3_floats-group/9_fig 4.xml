  <p class="p">Associations between taxa and climate over time in North America. (A) The number of OTUs associated with climate from different years. (B) Most OTUs associated with historic climate were also associated with contemporary climate. Symbol size is proportional to the strength of the association, and OTUs (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) are ordered by the earliest year of climate with which they were associated. (C) The magnitude of shifts in relative abundance of OTUs with equilibration would be comparable to contemporary intersample variability in their relative abundance. Red lines indicate current intrasample differences in relative abundance; black dots represent the projected shifts in relative abundance with equilibration.
