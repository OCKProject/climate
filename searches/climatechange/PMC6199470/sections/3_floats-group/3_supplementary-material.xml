 <p class="p">Results for soil bacterial families across the Tibetan Plateau. Abundances of 53 prevalent bacterial families (&gt;40 samples) are associated with historical climate. (A) Importance of climate variables for predicting distributions of families. Historic climate variables tend to be as important as contemporary climate variables. (B to D) Same as Fig. 1A to C, but for families. (E) Same as Fig. 2C, but showing the distribution of current intersample differences in relative abundances of families. (F) Same as Fig. 2C, but showing the distribution of projected future intersample differences of relative abundances of families. (G) Shifts in the relative abundance of families as a function of their current relative abundance. Red, increases; blue, decreases. Shifts are significantly inversely associated with current relative abundance, as evidenced by blue symbols being clustered in the upper part of the graph. (H) Same as Fig. 2C, but showing the distribution of projected future intersample differences in relative abundances of families. Download
