  <p class="p">Model predictions in the Tibetan Plateau and North America show increasing prokaryotic diversity in both regions. Models of prokaryotic richness fitted on data from sampling locations were used to predict current richness across the Tibetan Plateau (top left) and northern North America (bottom left). Then the same models were used to predict future richness by plugging in current climate data. When these forecasted maps were compared to the current maps, they revealed large shifts in richness in both regions (right), with richness increasing in the majority of locations (red) but decreasing in others (blue).</p>
