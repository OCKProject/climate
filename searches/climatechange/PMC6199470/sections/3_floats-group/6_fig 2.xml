  <p class="p">With equilibration to contemporary climate, the distributions of soil prokaryotes in Tibet would shift substantially. (A) Across most of the locations sampled, richness would increase, although in some locations it would decrease. Red and blue indicate increases and decreases in richness, respectively. (B) Increases in richness would be greatest in locations that have relatively low richness; locations with higher contemporary richness would see little change, or even decreases in richness. (C) The magnitude of shifts in relative abundance of OTUs with equilibration would be comparable to contemporary intersample variability in their relative abundance. Red lines indicate current intrasample differences in relative abundance; black dots represent the projected shifts in relative abundance with equilibration.</p>
