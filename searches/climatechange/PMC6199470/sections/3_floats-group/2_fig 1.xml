  <p class="p">Distributions of soil prokaryotes in Tibet lag behind shifts in climate by up to 50 years. (A) The number of OTUs associated with climate from different years. A given OTU can be associated with climate from multiple years; the 2011 category represents climate from the year of sample collection. Lags are indicated by the association of many OTUs with climate from prior to 2011 and in many cases prior to 1980. (B) OTUs were associated with climate from both contemporary and historic values of most climate variables (PC1, PC2, and PC3 are associated with temperature, precipitation, and temperature range, respectively). (C) Most OTUs associated with historic climate were also associated with contemporary climate. Symbol size is proportional to the strength of the association, and OTUs (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) are ordered by the earliest year of climate with which they were associated. (D) Soil properties were also associated with historic climate, suggesting that the lags in bacterial distributions may be mediated by or associated with lags in soil properties. Climate from all time periods competed in the model selection procedure for each edaphic factor, and only the resulting predictive associations are included in the histogram.
