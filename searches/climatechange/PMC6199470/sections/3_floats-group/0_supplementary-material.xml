 <p class="p">Overview of community composition, sampling sites, and climate data in the Tibetan Plateau. (A to C) Prokaryote community compositional structure in the Tibetan Plateau soils as indicated by nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots. Sites are color coded according to soil moisture content. (A) Based on Bray-Curtis distance. (B) Based on unweighted UniFrac distance. (C) Based on weighted UniFrac distance. (D) Relative abundance of the dominant phyla across samples from Tibetan Plateau. Relative abundances are based on the proportional frequencies of 16S rRNA sequences that could be classified at the phylum level. (E) Locations of sampling sites across Tibetan Plateau. (F) Principal components of climate data as a function of time show consistent trends or consistent trends followed by leveling off. There is one line for each grid cell in the climate data map that harbors one or more samples. Download
