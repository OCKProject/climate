 <p class="p">Results for diversity in the Tibetan Plateau. (A) Distributions of projected shifts in prokaryote richness within samples compared to current and future intersample differences in richness. Projected intrasample changes in richness are of similar magnitude to existing and projected future intersample differences in richness. (B) Same as panel A, but for Shannon diversity. (C) Same as Fig. 2B, but for Shannon diversity. (D) Amount of extrapolation necessary to make geographic projections of diversity. Maps show multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) values, which give how far out of the observed range climate conditions are at each location. Almost all locations within the Tibetan Plateau are less than 20% out of range (greater than −20 on the map) for both current and future projections, indicating that to make geographic projections, minimal extrapolation beyond the range of the observed data is necessary.
