<p class="p">Thus, our goals were (1) to explore the extent of potential species range shifts of European Beech on marginal calcareous soils in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century and (2) to test whether there is a soil microbial mechanism limiting beech seedling N nutrition and establishment and thus competitive strength under reduced water availability in a changing climate, potentially contributing to expected species range shifts on top of plant physiological constraints. Therefore, we conducted statistical species range modelling for European beech forests on calcareous soil for present day conditions and for the year 2080. In view of the importance of seedling establishment for species range shifts we assessed beech seedling performance under exposure to climate change conditions in a field experiment, thereby considering soil microbial community composition, gross rates of microbial N turnover, soil N availability and N nutrition of beech seedlings. For this purpose, we deployed an enriched stable isotope-based experimental approach to simultaneously quantify all major N turnover processes in intact beech seedling-soil-microbe systems, thereby maintaining plant-soil microbe interactions and competition for N. By translocation of soil-mesocosms containing natural beech regeneration across a narrow valley from the northwest (NW, cool moist microclimate) to the southwest (SW, warm-dry microclimate) aspect, we combined this approach with a space-for-time climate change experiment. In addition to exposure-induced reduction of soil water availability, a roof system accelerated drought during a 39 days period at the SW aspect. Supporting measurements included abundance of genes related to ammonia oxidation, mycorrhizal colonization and N metabolite levels in fine roots as well as plant biomass and isotope recovery in beech seedlings three months after
