 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], we computed the distribution range in the form of the realized niche of beech forests on calcareous soil in Europe. For present day conditions, the modeled potential species range distribution of European beech (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, left panel) reflected well the distribution of limestone bedrock geology. East of the Rhine rift valley, distribution patterns followed the Jurassic limestone mountain ranges along the Swabian and Franconian Cuesta Mountains from SW to SE Germany. West of the Rhine valley, there was a continuation of distribution patterns following the similar Jurassic bedrock geology towards the edge of the Paris-Seine Basin. The Jurassic mountain ranges along the border between France and Switzerland were identified to be another important potential distribution area. The Southern distribution limit was ranging from the Cantabrian Mountains and Pyrenees in Spain to the Provence in Southern France, the calcareous Apennine Mountains in Central Italy to the Balkan Mountains and the mountainous regions of Greece.
