<p class="p">Overall these forests would cover an area of 31.4 million ha, i.e., approximately one third of the current potential beech forests in Europe (104.0 million ha), [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>, right panel) we computed a potential distribution of 7.2 million ha in the year 2080, i.e., a drastic reduction to 22% of the current distribution. In this scenario, potential beech species range distribution is mainly reduced to Alpine regions and Great Britain with only residual spots in Northern and SW Germany (
