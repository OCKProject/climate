<p class="p">In order to evaluate whether N limitation could be a driver of the drought sensitivity of European beech, gross N turnover in intact beech seedling-soil-microbe-mesocosms was determined in the frame of a space-for-time translocation climate change experiment. Transfer from NW to SW increased soil temperature on average by 1°C (
