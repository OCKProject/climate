Apparently this microbial mediated effect of climate change on beech seedling N nutrition was strong enough to reduce growth and competitive performance of beech seedlings already after one year, as indicated by plant biomass and N content (

A parallel study using the same experimental facilities as our work but focusing on the quantification of transcripts of functional N cycle genes found a persistent reduction of the transcripts of ammonia oxidizing archaea in the climate change treatment [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. This indicates that—though not visible in the gene abundance levels—also the nitrifying activity of archaea was negatively affected by the exposure to simulated climate change, which probably also contributed to the observed reduction of gross nitrification rates.
