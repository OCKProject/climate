<p class="p">The statistical species range distribution modelling indicated a dramatic biome shift of European beech on calcareous soils, i.e., a reduction of almost 80% of the realized niche of beech in the year 2080. This approach is based on relationships to climate indicators and is—in contrast to process-based ecosystem models—neither based on physiological nor on biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, such predictions of the suitable growth area can underestimate the adaptive capacities of tree species [
