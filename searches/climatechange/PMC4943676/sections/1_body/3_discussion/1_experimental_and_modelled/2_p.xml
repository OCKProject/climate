<p class="p">Compared with the SRES A2 scenario used for the statistical modelling, the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> space-for-time climate change experiment represents a smaller effect of climatic change. The NW exposure corresponds to a model climate for present day conditions of many beech forests in Central Europe, while the SW exposure is considered a model for climatic conditions expected in the target region for the following decades in the first half of the 21st century [
