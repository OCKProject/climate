<p class="p">The fast and clear changes in N biogeochemistry and N nutrition observed here due to translocation from NW to SW exposure raise questions regarding the extent the beech stands in the investigated valley were affected by aspect in the past decades. Indeed these two beech stands—planted at both sides of the valley 80 years ago—are characterized by marked differences with 35% reduced basal area, 5 m less tree height and a timber volume of 236 rather than 349 solid m
