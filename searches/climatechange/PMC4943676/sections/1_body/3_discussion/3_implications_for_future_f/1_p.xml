<p class="p">Impaired microbial provision of bioavailable N may be a stressor for beech in addition to plant physiological limitations under reduced soil water availability, enhancing the drought sensitivity of beech under predicted climatic changes. The nutritional deficiency could be further exacerbated by enhanced N leaching after prolonged drought due to retarded stabilization of microbial N in organo-mineral associations [
