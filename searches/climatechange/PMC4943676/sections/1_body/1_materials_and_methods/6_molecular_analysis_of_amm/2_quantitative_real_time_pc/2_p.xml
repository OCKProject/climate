<p class="p">For quantification, standard curves were calculated using serial dilutions (10
 <sup class="sup">1</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> gene copies μl
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) of plasmid DNA containing PCR products of the respective genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158823.s004" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). According to manufacturer’s instruction, the PCR detection limit was assessed to 10 gene copies. In advance, the optimal dilution for each amplification assay was determined by dilution series of randomly chosen DNA extracts, in order to prevent PCR inhibition. The qPCR assays were performed in 96-well plates (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) for all target genes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0158823.s004" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). All PCR runs began with a hot start at 95°C for 10 minutes. After each run, the specificity of the SYBR Green-quantified amplicons was checked by melting curve analysis and gel electrophoresis. The amplification efficiency was calculated from the formula Eff = [10
 <sup class="sup">(-1/slope)</sup>-1] and resulted in the following average efficiencies (standard deviation less than 5% of mean) for the different genes: AOA, 89%, AOB, 97%.
