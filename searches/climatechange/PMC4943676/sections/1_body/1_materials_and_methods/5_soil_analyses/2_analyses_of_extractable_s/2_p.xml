<p class="p">A second soil subsample was not immediately extracted, but first underwent a chloroform-fumigation over 24 hours as described in detail in an earlier publication [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and was extracted afterwards as described above with subsequent freezing of the extract for later analysis of (1) total N (organic + organic) and (2) Î´

 <sup class="sup">-</sup> concentrations in extracts were analysed colorimetrically by a commercial laboratory (Dr. Janssen, Gillersheim, Germany). Total organic C (TOC) and total N (TN) in extracts were quantified using an Infrared TOC analyser with a coupled chemoluminescence-based total N module (DIMATEC GmbH, Germany) [
