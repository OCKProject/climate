<p class="p">Soil samples were immediately frozen and freeze-dried after sampling. After removing roots and gravel using tweezers, bulk soil samples were finely ground. Determination of total soil C, N and δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N was performed in duplicate for every sample with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta V, Thermo Electron Corporation, Dreieich, Germany) coupled to an elemental analyser (Euro EA, Eurovector, Milan, Italy) at the Helmholtz Zentrum München, German Research Center for Environmental Health, Institute of Soil Ecology in Neuherberg. The 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N atom% excess enrichment was calculated by subtracting natural abundance values gained by the unlabelled mesocosms from the values obtained of the labelled soil-mesocosms.
