<p class="p">For harvesting, beech-soil-mesocosms were excavated under maintenance of an even ending at the bottom and entirely harvested within two hours after excavation. The beech seedling was cut and further processed as described below. The remaining soil/root system was carefully separated by hand into soil, gravel, dead coarse organic material and living fine and coarse roots. Additionally, mycorrhizal root tips and a subsample of rhizosphere soil (defined as soil adhering to root after vigorous shaking) were sampled and further processed as described below.</p>
