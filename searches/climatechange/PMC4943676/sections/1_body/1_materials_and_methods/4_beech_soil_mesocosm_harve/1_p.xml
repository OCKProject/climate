<p class="p">Eight intact beech-soil-mesocosms were harvested every sampling point for each of the three N-compound labelling treatments and each of the two slopes (NW exposure, control treatment and SW exposure, climate change treatment). Consequently, 48 beech-soil-mesocosms each were sampled on June 22, 2011 (6 hours after labelling), on June 24, 2011 (48 hours after the labelling), on August 2, 2011 (6 hours after labelling) on August 4 (48 hours after labelling) and on September 27, 2011 (3 months after labelling). The harvests on June 22–24, August 2–4 and September 27 were accompanied by additional sampling of unlabelled beech-soil-mesocosms to analyse ambient background inorganic N concentrations and isotopic natural abundance of investigated pools with 4–8 replicates per exposure.</p>
