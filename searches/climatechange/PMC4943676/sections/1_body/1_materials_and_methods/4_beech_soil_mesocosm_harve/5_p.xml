<p class="p">During each harvest, beech seedlings were carefully removed from mesocosms and separated into leaves, stems, coarse (&gt;2 mm diameter) and fine roots (&lt;2 mm diameter). Remaining adhering small soil was carefully washed from the roots and dried. The fresh weight of each plant tissue was determined. Samples were dried at 60°C until constant weight. After determination of the fresh weight, fine root samples were separated into two parts for subsequent analyses: one part for ectomycorrhizal analyses was wrapped in wet tissue and stored in plastic bags at 4°C until return to the laboratory, the second part was dried at 60°C for 2 days for later EA-IRMS analyses. For biochemical analyses of N metabolites in fine roots, additional samples were taken from unlabelled beech-soil-mesocosms on June 22 and shock-frozen in liquid N until sample analyses to avoid degradation of the metabolites.</p>
