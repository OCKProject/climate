<p class="p">Experimental data are shown as mean values with standard errors (SE) of the mean, if not otherwise stated. Data were log-transformed if necessary to meet the requirement of normality and subsequently analysed using two-way ANOVA with the factors exposure (NW versus SW exposure, i.e., control and climate change treatments), time and their interaction. Durbin-Watson test statistics revealed absence of autocorrelation between time points. Depending on the parameters investigated, the factor time has different levels with independent observations, since samples were taken from different beech-seedling-soil-mesocosms. There were two levels for gross rates of N turnover (June, September), three levels for N pools and abundance of microbial ammonia monooxygenase genes (June, August, September) and five levels for isotopic composition of C and N pools (June_6 hours after labelling; June_48 hours after isotope labelling; August_6 hours after isotope labelling; August_48 hours after isotope labelling and September_3 months after isotope labelling). Differences between the levels of the time factor within each treatment level were further tested by applying the Tukey post-hoc test. For plant metabolites in fine roots, single comparisons between SW and NW were performed with non-parametric U-tests due to smaller number of replicates.</p>
