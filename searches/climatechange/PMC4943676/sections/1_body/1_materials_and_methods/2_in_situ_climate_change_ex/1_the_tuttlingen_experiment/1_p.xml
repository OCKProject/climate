<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> climate change experiment with its biogeochemical, microbiological and plant physiological field studies was based on intact plant-soil-mesocosms with beech seedlings and was conducted in a typical N-limited mountainous beech forest growing on a Rendzic Leptosol in Southern Germany (Tuttlingen experimental beech forest, 8°45´E; 47°59´N, ca. 800 m a.s.l.). Mean annual air temperature is approximately 6.5°C and the average annual rainfall amounts to 854 mm (1961–1990). The clay-rich soil is classified as Rendzic Leptosol (Skeletic) according to the International Union of Soil Sciences Working Group WRB (2007) derived from horizontally bedded limestone and marls. Soil profiles are shallow followed by weathered parent rock containing &gt; 45% gravel and stones. Due to nutrient poor soils and low atmospheric N input, soil N cycling is characterized by competitive partitioning of N between beech and associated mycorrhiza vs. free living soil microorganisms [
