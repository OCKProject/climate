<p class="p">After an equilibration period of one year, short-term-isotope-tracing-based process studies were conducted via soil 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N labelling followed by destructive sampling to simultaneously quantify all relevant gross N turnover processes in the plant-soil-microbe system. Labelling of beech-soil-microbe-mesocosms took place on June 22, 2011 (72 beech-soil-mesocosms at NW and SW each), to (1) compare gross N turnover between ambient conditions at SW and NW exposure based on full destructive sampling six hours and 48 hours after labelling, and (2) to investigate 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N recovery at the end of growing season through a final sampling in September. A second labelling campaign took place after the roof period on August 2 (48 beech-soil-mesocosms at NW and SW each), followed again by sampling six and 48 hours after labelling. The August labelling/sampling cycle allowed to compare gross N turnover between ambient conditions at NW and roof-intensified drought (39 days) conditions at SW. Isotope recovery in the plant-soil-N pools three months after labelling was investigated in a third, final sampling in September 2011 (
