<p class="p">The climate change treatment was established using a space-for-time approach and combined with isotope-based process studies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0158823.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). We used topographic variability as a model for climate variability, thus identifying model ecosystems for present day and future climate conditions located on opposing slopes of a narrow valley. The control site with its NW aspect and cool-moist microclimate (representing current climate conditions) is located at a distance of less than 1 km to the climate change site with its SW aspect and warm-dry microclimate, representing “future climate conditions”. Microclimate at SW exposure is characterized by increased daily maximum of air and topsoil temperatures and thus reduced water availability [

Climate change was simulated by transferring stainless steel cylinders (15 cm height, 16.4 cm inner diameter) containing intact beech seedling-soil-microbe mesocosms of uniform size from NW exposure to SW exposure, with control transfers at the NW exposure sampling site [
