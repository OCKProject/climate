<p class="p">While reburying beech-soil-mesocosms, extreme care was taken to create a realistic transition between the bottom of the soil cores and the ambient soil. For this purpose, beech-soil-mesocosms were placed vertically in holes with a 5 cm thick horizontal bed made of homogenized NW soil and subsequently gently hammered down 2 cm at the new position. Finally, continuous contact between the litter layer on the transferred beech-soil-mesocosms and the surrounding litter layer at the new position was established. After transfer, all reburied intact beech-soil-mesocosms at both sites were irrigated with 500 ml of water over a period of two hours to avoid drying or death of enclosed beech seedlings following transfer. The amount of water corresponded to a precipitation event of 23.7 l m
 <sup class="sup">-2</sup>, i.e., a typical summer convective rainfall event. The survival rate of transferred beech seedlings was 97%.
