 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N-labelled and 32 unlabelled beech seedling-soil-mesocosms were analysed in this study. Coring and Transfer of beech seedling-soil-mesocosms was conducted within one week in absence of precipitation in July 2010. For coring, a suitable sampling area of 50 * 50 m with identical slope (18°) and similar soil profile was identified. In this representative area, finer grained soil (Ah horizon) was only found in the uppermost 15–20 cm (i.e., the main rooting zone of beech natural regeneration). There was a sharp transition between this almost gravel-free clay-rich finer grained soil and the deeper gravel-dominated periglacial layers which were not suitable for coring. In this sampling area, beech natural regeneration trees of 2.2–2.5 mm stem diameter and 30–40 cm height were selected. Custom-made stainless steel cylinders (height 150 mm, outer diameter 168 mm, sharp edge at bottom, wall thickness 2 mm, open at bottom and top) were manually driven into the soil with the selected beech seedling growing in the centre. A custom-made extension tool fitting to the stainless steel cylinders facilitated coring under avoidance of damage to the aboveground part of the plant. After coring, the cylinders, containing an intact beech-soil-mesocosm, were carefully excavated under preservation of an even ending at the bottom. Excavated beech-soil-mesocosms were immediately reburied vertically either within NW or after transfer to SW. The litter layer was preserved and contained in the cylinders during coring. Pre-tests showed that the entire root system of beech seedlings of this size fitted well to the embraced volume of the used steel cylinders. Only mesocosms without visible damage or cut beech roots were used.
