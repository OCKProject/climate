Aliquots of 1.0–2.5 mg for each tissue were weighed into tin capsules (IVA Analysentechnik, Meerbusch, Germany). Samples were analysed using an elemental analyser (Vario EL, elementar Analysensysteme GmbH, Hanau, Germany) coupled via an interface (Conflow III, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (Delta Plus, Thermo Finnigen MAT GmbH, Bremen, Germany).
