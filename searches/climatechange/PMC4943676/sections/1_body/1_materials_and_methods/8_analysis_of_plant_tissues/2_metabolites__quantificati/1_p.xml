<p class="p">For biochemical analyses of N metabolites in the fine roots of beech seedlings, only fine roots from unlabelled samples were used from three time points (see above). Total amino acids in the fine roots were extracted [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] from frozen homogeneous fine root material (~ 50mg) in 1 mL methanol:chloroform (3.5:1.5, v:v) and 0.2 mL buffer (pH 7.0) containing 20 mM Hepes, 5 mM EGTA and 10 mM NaF. Total amino acid concentration was quantified photometrically (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) at 570 nm as described by Liu et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] using the colour reaction with ninhydrin reagent. Glutamine was used as a standard (Sigma, Hamburg, Germany). Total soluble proteins were extracted from (~ 50mg) frozen and ground fine root material in 1 mL buffer (1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 15% glycerol (v:v), 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1% Triton-X 100) as previously described in detail [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Concentrations of total soluble protein were quantified photometrically at 595 nm using Bradford reagent (Ameresco Inc., Solon, Ohio, USA) in a UV-DU650 spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA). Bovine serum albumine (BSA A-6918, Sigma Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) was used as standard. Nitrate was extracted from c. 50 mg tissue in 0.1 g washed polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP Sigma-Aldrich Inc., Steinheim, Germany) [
 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Nitrate concentrations were determined using an ion chromatograph (DX 120, Dionex, Idstein, Germany) combined with an autosampler (AS 3500, Thermo Separation Products, Piscataway, USA) and equipped with the PeakNet software package (version 4.3, Dionex, Idstein, Germany). Nitrate, phosphate, and sulphate were used as standards.
