<p class="p">Samples of ectomycorrhizal root tips were collected for isotope measurements. For determination of C and N content as well as 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N and 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C enrichment, root tips were dried for three days at 60°C. 1–5 mg of root tip material was weighted in 5 x 9 mm tin capsules (IVA Analysetechnik, Meerbusch, Germany) with a micro balance (Supermicro S4; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany). Measurements were conducted at the service unit KOSI (Kompetenzzentrum für Stabile Isotope, University Göttingen, Germany) using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS Delta Plus, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) coupled via an interface (Conflo III, Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) to an elemental analyser (NA1110, CE-Instruments, Rodano, Milano, Italy). Acet anilide was used as standard, IAEA N1 (δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>Nair 0.4 ‰) und N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (δ
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>Nair 20.3 ‰) for N calibrations and IAEA 600 (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>CVPDB -27.7 ‰) for C calibrations.
