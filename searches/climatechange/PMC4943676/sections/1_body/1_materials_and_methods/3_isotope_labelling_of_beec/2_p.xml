<p class="p">Labelling was conducted simultaneously at NW and SW starting at 5:00 am and took 3 hours (June) and 2 hours (August). The label solution always contained all three N compounds used in this experiment, i.e., NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> and glutamine, and depending on the labelling treatment, either NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> or glutamine was isotopically enriched (50 atom % 
 <sup class="sup">15</sup>N). Glutamine was also enriched in 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C (50 atom%) 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C for glutamine). Glutamine was chosen as an organic N compound because earlier studies showed high glutamine uptake capacities of and abundance in beech seedlings and adult beech trees at this site [

 <xref rid="pone.0158823.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The amount of N added via label solution equalled to 3.5 mg NH

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> soil dry weight (sdw), 3.5 mg NO

 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> sdw, and 0.7 mg glutamine-N kg
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> sdw. Soil NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> background concentrations in unlabeled soil were hardly different between NW and SW. However, background soil NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> concentrations were generally much smaller at SW than at NW. Therefore, the ratio of added NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">−</sup>-N via label solution to background soil NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> was larger for SW than for NW. In June, N added via label solution equalled to 76% and 80% of ambient NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> concentrations and 35% and 78% of ambient NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> concentrations at NW and SW, respectively. In August, this equalled 84% and 114% of ambient soil NH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>
 <sup class="sup">+</sup> concentrations. However, NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> levels were extremely low at SW, so that added label equalled to 211% and 762% of ambient NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> concentrations at NW and SW, respectively. Hence, several-fold reduced soil NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-</sup> levels were observed both in unlabelled mesocosms and in labelled mesocosms of the climate change treatment.
