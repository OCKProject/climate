<p class="p">Measurements of N pool size in soil and plant as well as isotopic information of plant, soil organic, inorganic, microbial and mycorrhizal N pools was used to calculate (1) gross rates of ammonification and nitrification using isotope pool dilution approaches based on the data gained 6 hours and 48 hours after
