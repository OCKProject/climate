  <p class="p">The figure illustrates coring of beech-soil-mesocosms by use of stainless steel cylinders with subsequent pre-incubation for one year either under cool-moist microclimate at the coring site (NW exposure, control) or warm-dry microclimate (SW-exposure, climate change). After pre-incubation and equilibration, homogeneous labelling of the intact beech seedling-soil-microbe systems with either 
   <sup class="sup">15</sup>N/
   <sup class="sup">13</sup>C-enriched glutamine, 
   <sup class="sup">15</sup>N-ammonium (NH
   <sub class="sub">4</sub>
   <sup class="sup">+</sup>) or 
   <sup class="sup">15</sup>N-nitrate (NO
   <sub class="sub">3</sub>
   <sup class="sup">-</sup>) and subsequent double harvests (6 and 48 hours after labelling) were conducted for determination of gross N turnover rates in the beech seedling-soil-microbe system in June (comparison of ambient NW vs. SW climatic conditions) and August (ambient NW conditions vs. roof-intensified drought at SW). A final sampling of mesocosms labelled in June allowed investigating long-term isotope recovery in September (three months after labelling). All three sampling dates were accompanied by determination of supporting soil and plant parameters such as abuncance of microbial genes related to ammonia oxidation, mycorrhization, and plant metabolites.
