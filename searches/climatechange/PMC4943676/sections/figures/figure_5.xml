  <title class="title">Gravimetric soil moisture related to water holding capacity (WHC) as determined from labelled (n = 48) and unlabelled (n = 4 to 8) beech-soil-mesocosms in June (ambient conditions at both exposures), August (intensified drought at SW exposure due to roof) and September (final harvest).</title>
  <p class="p">Asterisks indicate significant differences (p&lt;0.05) between NW and SW exposure at the respective harvest. Different indices indicate significant differences between different sampling dates and labelled and unlabelled beech-soil-mesocosms.</p>
