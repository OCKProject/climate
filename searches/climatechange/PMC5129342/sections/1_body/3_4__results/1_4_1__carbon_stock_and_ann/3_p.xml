<p class="p">The amount of wood material in use will actually decrease over the entire life cycle. The outflow from the HWP carbon pool was calculated based on estimated half-life (solid wood products, 30 years; paper products, 2 years) and associated decay rates of HWP from use by assuming first-order decay rates. We provide valid estimates of the carbon stock and total release of carbon from HWP. The accumulated carbon stock increased gradually from 130 Tg in 1960 to 705.6 Tg in 2014, with the contributions of solid wood products and paper products being 664.2 TgC (94.1%) and 41.4 TgC (5.9%), respectively (

The category of solid wood products fluctuated before 2003, underwent a sharp increase to 43 TgC in 2014, and reached approximately 95% of the total annual carbon increment of the HWP carbon pool.
