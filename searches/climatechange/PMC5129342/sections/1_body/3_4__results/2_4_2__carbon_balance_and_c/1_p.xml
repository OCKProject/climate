 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-01132-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> shows the annual carbon balance of HWP, including carbon balance between emission reduction via substitution of fossil fuel (coal) with wood residue or charcoal, as well as carbon emissions caused by fossil fuel consumption in the production and processing of wood products. Carbon emissions increased from 0.08 TgC in 1960 to 2.8 TgC in 2014. An increase in carbon reduction was observed from 19.9 TgC in 1960 to 33.7 TgC in 2014, which was 1.7 times the 1960 value, by using wood fuel, residue and wood charcoal for energy.
