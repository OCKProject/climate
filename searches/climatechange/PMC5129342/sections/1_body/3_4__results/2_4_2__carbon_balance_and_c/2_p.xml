<p class="p">To compensate for national carbon emissions, the net carbon contribution of Chinaâ€™s HWP was approximated based on the estimation of the value of the carbon stock of HWP; the carbon emission reduction by substitution for fossil fuels; and the value of carbon emissions increase in the production and processing stages. The carbon contribution increased from 23 TgC in 1960 to 76.1 TgC in 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-01132-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The annual change of the amount showed an obvious 11 TgC reduction in 2014. The international energy statistics published in the U.S. Energy Information Administration show that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from the consumption of energy in China increased from 1440 Tg in 1981 to 8687 Tg in 2013. One unit of C sequestered in the HWP pool can be equal to 44/12 unit of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> removed from the atmosphere. Notably, in the last decade, the annual contribution of HWP could compensate for approximately 2.9% of the national CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions as the annual carbon stock and carbon reduction by substitution of fossil fuels maintained an evident increase.
