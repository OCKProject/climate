<p class="p">The 17th Conference of Party (COP17) held in Durban in 2011 concluded that only HWP from domestic harvests could be included in national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. The 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol (referred to as 2013 Guidance hereafter) did not repudiate other approaches, although it selected PA (referred to as PA-2013 hereafter) as the universal approach [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Under this guidance, numerous scholars have adopted PA-2013 to investigate carbon stock in the forestry carbon pool and the life cycle of HWP [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. A few scholars combined PA with carbon flow theory to develop new model architectures, in order to estimate the contribution of both carbon stock and substitution of wood use for energy or energy-intensive material. Chihiro et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] constructed a system dynamic model to investigate the interregional carbon flows and balance of HWP in Japan. When the carbon reduction of wood substitution for energy was considered, the sum of the carbon sink and reduction were greater than the carbon emissions associated with HWP.
