<p class="p">Vigorous discussions about HWP in relation to climate change are ongoing and are mainly focused on approaches that account for HWP carbon pools. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has proposed three approaches for HWP carbon accounting in the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories; these approaches are the stock-change approach, the atmospheric flow approach, and the production approach (referred to as PA-2006 hereafter). These approaches differ in terms of their treatment of the HWP international trade, engendering different accounting scope and system boundary of the HWP carbon pool [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, the 2006 Guidelines did not show preference for any of these approaches. The national carbon accounting using any one of these approaches would be acceptable. Under the IPCC Guidelines, studies on estimating the HWP carbon pool have been conducted worldwide [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The research results verify that HWP plays an important role in climate mitigation. Meanwhile, numerous studies have promoted the evolution of the three IPCC approaches and their applications [
