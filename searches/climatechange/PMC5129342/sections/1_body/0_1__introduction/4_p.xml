<p class="p">China is both the major supplier and consumer of wood resources in the world. Recent studies on the national HWP carbon sink have mainly focused on estimating the carbon removal achieved by the countryâ€™s HWP carbon pool [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Researchers have determined that HWP has become a significant component of the national carbon pool and have proposed that the carbon balance of HWP should be included in the national GHG inventories. However, different selected methods will affect the research results. Furthermore, the current carbon flow and balance of HWP in China have not yet been properly and comprehensively investigated. Therefore, our study aims to assess and analyze the carbon balance and contribution of the HWP carbon pool in China, on the basis of elaborating the mechanisms of carbon flow, including carbon sequestration, carbon emission, and substitution of fossil fuel consumption.
