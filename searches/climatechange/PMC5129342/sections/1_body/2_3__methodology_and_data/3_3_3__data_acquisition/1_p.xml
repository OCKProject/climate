<p class="p">The IPCC Guidance suggest that the statistics of different categories of HWP should be obtained from FOASTAT of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). HWPs are divided according to different decay rates into solid wood products (industrial roundwood, sawnwood, and wood-based panels) and paper products (paper and paperboard). The statistics of production, import, and export volumes for various types of HWP are obtained in 1960â€“2014.</p>
