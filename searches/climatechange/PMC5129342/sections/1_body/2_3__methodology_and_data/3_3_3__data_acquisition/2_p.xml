<p class="p">This study adopts the factors provided in the IPCC 2013 Appendix, which are the universal data sources for HWP carbon accounting (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-13-01132-t001" class="xref">Table A1</xref>). The carbon emission intensity and substitution factors for HWP carbon balance system are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-13-01132-t002" class="xref">Table A2</xref>. The basic density of HWP is the oven-dry species tons per m

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of solid wood products or per air-dried ton carbon of paper products. This amount can be calculated by multiplying the density of each material by the carbon conversion factor [
