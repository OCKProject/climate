<p class="p">The contribution of wood usage to produce energy is considerable. The reductions in carbon emissions were about 12 times the size of the emissions in HWP producing and processing stage during the past decade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-01132-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). If wood is substituted for natural gas instead of coal, the reduction amount of carbon emissions will drop by approximately 40% due to the different energy conversion efficiency values. Nevertheless, the reductions were still much greater than the carbon emissions. The effects of substitution of energy would be further enhanced if the energy conversion efficiency of waste wood and residues can be improved.
