<p class="p">Previous research reported that the amount of national carbon stock in HWP was 519.9 TgC, with an annual increment of 13.53 TgC in 2011 [

 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In the current research, the result of national carbon stock in the HWP pool is 570 TgC in 2011 and 706 TgC in 2014, which is higher than those of the existing researches. This result is mainly attributed to the different coefficients, which describe the relationship between HWP trade and production in PA-2006 and the relationship between the corresponding feedstock trade and production in PA-2013. The share of domestic feedstock for the production of wood products originating from domestic forests is used in the PA-2013 methodology.
