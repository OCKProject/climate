<p class="p">In the processes of producing raw wood materials, semi-finished products, and end-use products, the consumption of electricity and fuels will increase CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (Teragrams Carbon (TgC)). Carbon emissions are calculated by multiplying the production amounts (m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) of wood products by their respective carbon emission intensities (TgC/m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-13-01132" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. These emission intensities are calculated by dividing direct carbon (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) emissions (TgC) from the energy consumption for each sector by the production amounts (m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>). Direct carbon emissions are calculated through an input–output (I–O) analysis based on national I–O tables, which divide the economy of a nation into several sectors.
