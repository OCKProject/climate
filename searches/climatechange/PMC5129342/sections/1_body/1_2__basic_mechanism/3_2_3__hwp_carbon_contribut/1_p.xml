<p class="p">The accounting of HWP is confined to products where wood is derived from domestic harvest in the reporting country. In most previous studies, the estimation of HWP contribution to carbon mitigation refers to the annual change in the carbon stock of the HWP in use. In this research, we expand the system boundary of HWP carbon flow to assess the carbon stock of the HWP in use, besides the balance between the carbon emission reduction by wood substitution for fossil fuel and carbon emission increase in the production and processing stages. Then, net carbon removal (carbon stock and net emission reduction) can be estimated as a consecutive carbon contribution of Chinaâ€™s HWP to compensate for national carbon emissions. </p>
