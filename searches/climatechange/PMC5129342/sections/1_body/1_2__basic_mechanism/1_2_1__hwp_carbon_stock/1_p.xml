<p class="p">Long-term sustainable forest management and timely transfer of carbon into wood products help reduce atmospheric carbon. Along the HWP process and value chain, the flow of an HWP carbon pool can be divided into three stages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-13-01132-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). First, in the harvest process, carbon absorbed by forests during photosynthesis will be transferred to carbon storage in industrial roundwood, wood residues, fuelwood, and charcoal, which can be regarded as an input of the HWP carbon pool. Second, in the HWP processing stage, carbon in industrial roundwood will be transferred to carbon sink in different categories of wood products and then released gradually over a long life cycle. Meanwhile, carbon in residues and fuelwood/charcoal will be released through decay or combustion within a short period. Third, in the waste disposal stage, carbon stored in wood waste discarded in landfills will be preserved for a long period under anaerobic conditions.
