<p class="p">The carbon uptake of the HWP in use will be released during the life cycle of different categories of finished wood products, such as paper products, buildings, or furniture. Carbon stock can be calculated by multiplying usage amounts of wooden products with a lifetime function, which is established from various parameters, including number of years passed, decrease rate, and half-lives. HWP can become a considerable carbon stock through effective use and management. </p>
