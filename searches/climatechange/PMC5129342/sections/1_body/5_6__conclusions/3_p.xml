<p class="p">Considering the carbon balance between emission reduction via substitution of fossil fuels and carbon emissions in the production and processing stages of wood products, the results showed that the reduction in carbon emissions was approximately twelve times the amount of emissions from the HWP producing and processing stage during the last decade. Furthermore, the net carbon removal and reduction increased from 23 TgC in 1960 to 76.1 TgC in 2014. The annual contribution of HWP could compensate for approximately 2.9% of the national CO
