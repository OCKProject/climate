<p class="p">Due to the lack of information on historic acreages of wetlands and uplands, the present study focused only on the rate of land loss of the Islands, not conversion of uplands to wetlands. However, as the current mean upland elevation of the Town (1.46 m above PMSL, average tidal range 0.37 m) is known, an estimate of the future habitability of the Town’s uplands can be estimated based on expected rates of RSLR; we did so using the projected rates of RSLR derived from data and equations at the website
