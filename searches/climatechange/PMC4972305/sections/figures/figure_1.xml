  <title class="title">Cross-validation compared to disaggregation across five simulated sample sizes (n = 99 simulations).</title>
  <p class="p">Figure shows mean absolute error across the MRP results and disaggregation of the full sample at the district level. The analysis is for five variables: belief that climate change is happening, belief that cliamte change is at least partly human-caused, belief that climate change is mostly human-caused, support for cap and trade, and support for a carbon tax. For each variable, we average across five districts.</p>
