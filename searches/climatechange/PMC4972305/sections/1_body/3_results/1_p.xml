 <xref rid="pone.0159774.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The strongest levels of climate change belief exist in coastal BC, Quebec, Nova Scotia as well as in urban areas across the country. Belief in climate change is somewhat lower in rural Canada, particularly across the Prairies. However, despite this variation, a majority of Canadians in each federal electoral district believe that climate change is happening. Further, in over 97% of districts (n = 324), belief levels are over 60% and in just under 89% of districts belief levels are over 70%. Note that we only estimate belief levels in 334 of Canadaâ€™s 338 electoral districts. These figures exclude the Northern territories and the Newfoundland district of Labrador. At the extreme, belief in climate change exceeds 90% of the public in the Quebec district of Laurier-Sainte-Marie, the district of Vancouver East, and the district of Halifax.
