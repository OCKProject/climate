<p class="p">Canadians hold more variable beliefs about climate changeâ€™s causes. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159774.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> visualizes the estimated proportion of Canadians who believe that humans contribute to observed climate change. This variation has both a regional component and a rural-urban component. The figure insets highlight higher levels of belief in the six largest urban areas of Canada. Opinions in these urban areas contrast sharply with estimated beliefs in surrounding rural areas. Regionally, belief that climate change is human-caused is lowest in the more greenhouse gas intensive parts of Canada, including parts of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan where oil sands developments are located. In other words, places that are more significantly contributing to climate change show lower beliefs that humans are the cause. At the same time, urban districts in Alberta, including Calgary and Edmonton, have publics who more closely match publics in Ontario, Quebec, or British Columbia.
