 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159774.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> we merge the Canadian district-level results with U.S. estimates for 2014 at the congressional district level, as measured by the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication and available as part of [
 <xref rid="pone.0159774.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. These U.S. estimates are available at

Note that the U.S. opinion survey asks the public about their perceptions of ‘global warming,’ while the Canadian survey asks about perceptions of the Earth getting warmer.’ We cannot exclude the possibility that a portion of the differences between Canadian and US opinions estimates is a function of subtle differences in question wording.
