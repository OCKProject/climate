 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159774.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> depicts majority support for carbon cap and trade across each Canadian province.

However, the overall pattern is clear: there is majority support for emissions trading in 
 <italic class="italic">every</italic> Canadian district. The lowest support is 56% in the Alberta district of Battle-River-Crowfoot. Support exceeds 66% in over half of Canadian districts, reaching a high of 75% in the Montreal-area Laurier-Sainte-Marie district.
