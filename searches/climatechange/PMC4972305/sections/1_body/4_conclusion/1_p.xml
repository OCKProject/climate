<p class="p">To date, we have lacked high-resolution social science data to support climate research, policy and planning in Canada. Public opinion data have primarily been national; even accurate provincial data has been sparse. This new public data set will thus fill an important need for high resolution information on public attitudes, perceptions and policy preferences on issues related to climate change and climate mitigation policy.</p>
