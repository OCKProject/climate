<p class="p">A window of opportunity has recently opened for climate policy in Canada. After more than a decade of federal inaction, a new government committed to enacting climate policy was elected in late 2015. This new Liberal government aims to develop a plan to price and cap carbon emissions nationally. Given that existing provincial mitigation policy is highly variable in both instrument choice and stringency, the federal government is planning to work with the provinces to strengthen and harmonize policies. Propitiously, a new Alberta government was also elected in 2015. This New Democratic Party government is also committed to enacting new climate policy at the provincial level, phasing out coal electricity by 2030 and capping overall oil sands emissions. Meanwhile, other provinces, including Ontario, Quebec and British Columbia (BC), have already enacted a broad range of climate policy instruments, including phasing out coal, implementing a carbon tax, and working with California on a regional cap and trade system [
