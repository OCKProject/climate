<p class="p">Overall, we find evidence of broad Canadian support for climate policies. The Canadian public overwhelmingly believes the climate is changing, and a majority believe it is at least partly human caused. We find generally high support for emissions trading policies across all districts, with more variation in support for a carbon tax. Even so, over 42% of Canadian districts have majority support for increasing taxes on carbon-based fuels; this is a much higher distribution than seen in the United States and speaks to enhanced public support for action in the short term.</p>
