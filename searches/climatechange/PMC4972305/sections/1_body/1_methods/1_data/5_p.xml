<p class="p">To support the post-stratification stage of our MRP models, we obtained custom crosstabs from Statistics Canada; these data provide language by education by gender population count crosstabs from 2011 census data for each 2013 federal electoral district and each Canadian province. We calibrated the categorization in our climate opinion survey data with the census cross tabs by coding language into three categories (English, French, Other), gender into two categories (Male, Female), and education into four categories (Less than high school graduate, High school graduate, Some college or technical school, college or graduate degree).</p>
