<p class="p">Our primary covariate data come from the 2011 Canadian National Household Survey. For each province and district, we construct variables for the fraction of residents that: drive to work; belong to the Christian faith; and are employed in the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 21 industries, which focus on fossil fuel, natural gas and mineral mining and extraction. We also merge election results data from the 2011 Canadian federal election to our data set. We use Elections Canada data that reprojects 2011 election results onto the 2013 electoral district representation order. In other words, this file redistributes all votes from the 2011 election into current district boundaries. We explored the use of per capita carbon emissions in the model; however, this data did not provide marginal predictive power above and beyond data on NAICS 21 employment. To measure per capita carbon emissions, we developed a custom data set using the FFDAS 2010.01Â°grid raster to estimate the point source carbon emissions for each Canadian federal electoral district and province.</p>
