<p class="p">Respondents were geocoded using self-reported postal codes, which were then matched to latitude and longitude coordinates created from the June 2013 Postal Code Conversion File (PCCF), available from Statistics Canada. In cases where respondents did not provide their postal code, postal codes contained in the CATI sample files were used. Where necessary, secondary matching was performed using the first three characters of the six-character Canadian postal code (known as Forward Sortation Areas, or FSAs), which were obtained in the original telephone sample files. We achieve an overall match rate of 87.8% using the full self-reported six-character Canadian postal code, with a further 9.7% of respondents geocoded using the first three characters of the postal code and matching to FSA centroids created from the 2011 FSA map shapefile from Statistics Canada. In a handful of exceptions, respondents were geocoded by matching to either the Census subdivision (1.2%), Census division (0.9%), or postal district (the first character of the postal code, 0.4%). These procedures allow for latitude-longitude coordinates to be assigned to all survey respondents. Finally, the federal electoral district of each respondent was identified by overlaying Elections Canada shapefiles of Canadian electoral districts (using the 2013 Representation Order, i.e., the electoral districts first used nationally in the 2015 federal general elections) on respondent latitude-longitude coordinates.</p>
