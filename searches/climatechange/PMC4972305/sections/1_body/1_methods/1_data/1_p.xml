<p class="p">Our new opinion models build from a series of probability-based, regionally stratified and nationally representative Canadian survey samples. Four separate waves of the 
 <italic class="italic">Canadian Surveys on Energy and the Environment</italic> were undertaken in 2011 (n = 1214), 2013 (n = 1502), 2014 (n = 1401) and 2015 (n = 1014). All interviews were administered by Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) using Random Digit Dialing (RDD) and were conducted in either English or French by professional CATI service providers, Léger (2011, 2013 and 2014) and Elemental Data Collection (2015). These dual-frame samples included landline and cell phone listings from the 10 Canadian provinces, and excluded phone sample records from the less populated northern territories. Due to the relatively small proportion of people living in Canada’s territories, public opinion research typically excludes these residents. We obtain a combined response rate of 8% averaged across samples. This estimate relies on the American Association of Public Opinion Research method for calculating response rates (AAPOR RR3). According to a Pew Research Center study [
 <xref rid="pone.0159774.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] a general decline in response rates can be observed across nearly all types of surveys in the United States as well as in other countries. In 2012, the typical response rate for a Pew RDD telephone survey was 9%. Some experiments have found limited evidence of non-response bias resulting from this decline in telephone response rates [

Additionally, inclusion of cell phones in our 2013, 2014 and 2015 samples tends to lower average response rates (because completed cell phone surveys are more difficult to obtain); however, cell phone coverage also ensures better representation of younger demographics that are less inclined to have a landline phone number. This dual-frame sampling strategy has become a standard methodology in the survey research industry to minimize non-coverage bias and maximize sample representativeness over the past 10 years [
