<p class="p">Each variable is indexed over individual i and over response categories j,k,l and m for language, education, gender, and time variables respectively. The geography variable is flexible, indexing either provinces (p) or federal electoral districts (d) depending on which geographic level is being modeled. The 
 <italic class="italic">time</italic> variable indicates the survey wave of particular respondents in the model. Including this 
 <italic class="italic">time</italic> variable allows us to generate estimates tailored to the most survey time period even as we pool across multiple time periods.
