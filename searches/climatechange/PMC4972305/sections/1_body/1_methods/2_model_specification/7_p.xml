<p class="p">In the 
 <italic class="italic">post-stratification</italic> step, we first produce a table of population counts for each individual demographic type (language, gender, education) for each geographic unit (province or district). Given that the cross-tabs summarize these three variables across 9 total levels, each geographic subunit is associated with 24 individual demographic counts. For example, one cross-tab is the number of high-school educated men with English as their first language living in the Halifax West district. Our multi-level regression model produces an estimated level of opinion for each demographic type in each political geography. With 10 provinces at 335 districts, and 24 population types, we thus generate 240 unique provincial and 334âˆ—24 = 8016 district estimates. There are 338 total federal electoral districts in the 2015 representation order. We exclude the three territories and Labrador because we do not have any respondents from these three territories, and only one respondent from Labrador.
