<p class="p">At the national level, previous work has found that 81% of Canadians believe climate change is happening but only 47% think climate change is caused

Relative to the American public then, Canadians are significantly more likely to perceive solid evidence of a global warming trend, and this difference has remained stable over time. However, in this article we find that such aggregate assessments mask important local variation within the Canadian federation. In Nova Scotia for example, we report that 87% say climate change is happening, whereas 66% report this belief in Saskatchewan; within federal electoral districts, percentages vary from 56% in the Sourisâ€“Moose Mountain district in Saskatchewan, to 91% in the district of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
