<p class="p">The predictive ability of the MRP model can be assessesed by comparing mean absolute errors across each simulated sample size. We also calculate the mean absolute error from raw disaggragated projections for each geographic area and subsample size for comparison against the MRP estimates. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0159774.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> illustrates the performance of the MRP model at the smaller district level across our five variables. MRP consistently outperforms disaggregation for each variable at the district level. As expected, the mean absolute error of both the MRP and disaggregation techniques decreases as we increase the simulated sample size of each district. MRP vastly outperforms disaggregation in areas with smaller populations, which mirrors findings from previous work in the U.S. [
 <xref rid="pone.0159774.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Results from the crossvalidation tests at the province level indicate that MRP performs similarly to disaggregation (results provided in the online SI). Disaggregating a large set of national survey data across the 10 provinces produces results with similar accuracy to our MRP model. However, MRP also carries an additional advantage over disaggregation at this levelâ€“it is able to account for changes in opinion over time, unlike simple disaggregation of survey data collected over multiple years.
