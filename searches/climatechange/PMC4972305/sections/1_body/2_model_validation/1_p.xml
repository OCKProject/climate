<p class="p">Internal validation was performed to test the accuracy and reliability of our model estimates in the Canadian context. This technique follows a cross-validation procedure described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0159774.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and used in [
 <xref rid="pone.0159774.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In repeated simulations, subsamples of varying sizes were randomly selected from a large-population province or district and used to simulate the samples of smaller provinces or districts. We then compare MRP model estimates on these subsampled data sets to estimates from the full data set. For example, we take the largest province, Ontario, and through random subsampling reduce the number of respondents in Ontario (n = 1642) to the sample sizes of smaller provinces, from Alberta (n = 750) to Prince Edward Island (n = 21). We repeat the subsampling procedure across 99 simulations, for the four largest provinces (Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, and Alberta), and for our five dependent variables.
