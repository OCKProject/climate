<p class="p">We also performed crossvalidation at the district level in the same manner. In this case, we take advantage of sampling variation in the original surveys and validate using districts with the largest number of survey respondents. These districts were slightly oversampled in the original surveys and are geographically and demographically diverse. At the district level we use five districts ranging from n = 29 to n = 68 respondents (Courtenay–Alberni, BC; Selkirk–Interlake–Eastman, MB; Manicouagan, QC; Sherbrooke, QC; and Eglinton–Lawrence, ON). We randomly reduce the number of respondents in each district to 25, 20, 15, 10, and 5 respondents. We repeat this subsampling across 99 simulations for each of the five dependent variables. We compare these cross-validation estimates to survey subsamples for each geographic area. We repeat this for samples post-stratified by gender, educational attainment, and language to account for possible demographic non-representativeness of the national sample within smaller geographic areas.</p>
