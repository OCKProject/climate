 <italic class="italic">NP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">GP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> to temperature was consistently unimodal; photosynthesis increased gradually with temperature up to an optimum and decreased afterwards. Nonetheless and despite the consistently unimodal shape, there were differences between species. For example, the fall phase at temperatures beyond the optimum seemed more pronounced in three of the four downward seaweeds (not in 
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic>) than in upward algae. No differences were found in the photosynthetic efficiency at low irradiance (α) between upward and downward trend species (results not shown).
