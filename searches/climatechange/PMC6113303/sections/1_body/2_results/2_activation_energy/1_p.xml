<p id="Par18" class="p">We were able to estimate activation energies for net and gross photosynthesis in seven of the eight seaweeds (Table

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in upward algae compared to 0.25–0.26 eV in downward ones and Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons indicated that the differences between both sets of species were statistically significant in most cases (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. Again, net photosynthesis was more responsive to temperature in upward than in downward algae, with activation energies ranging 0.40–0.94 eV in the former while only 0.18–0.22 eV in the latter. Bonferroni-corrected pairwise tests again revealed significant differences between upward and downward algae, although the slightly wider confidence intervals of some estimates lowered the statistical power of some comparisons compared to
