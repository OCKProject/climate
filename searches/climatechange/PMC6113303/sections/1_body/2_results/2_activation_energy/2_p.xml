<p id="Par19" class="p">A very different picture emerged when we analysed the temperature dependence of dark respiration (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The conditional sums of squares test detected statistically significant differences among seaweeds (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic> = 2.7; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>-value = 0.0124). Nonetheless, the Bonferroni-corrected pairwise comparisons indicated that this was mostly a consequence of the extreme temperature dependence shown by respiration in the upward
