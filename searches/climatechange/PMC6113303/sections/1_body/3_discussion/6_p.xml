<p id="Par25" class="p">Our proposal that the activation energy of photosynthesis and respiration may help to foresee the vulnerability to water warming does not necessarily imply that temperature alters the abundance of these seaweeds through an impact on the rates of photosynthesis and respiration. It has long been known that the geographic boundaries of seaweeds are set by limitations to growth (temperature inappropriate for population growth), but also by limitations to survival (temperature prevents the survival of the hardiest stage) or to reproduction (temperature prevents the maturation of some stage)

 </sup>. Therefore, we suggest that the temperature dependence of photosynthesis and respiration might serve as a biomarker of the ability of some seaweeds to cope with water warming, even though temperature may actually have a stronger, more influential impact on life cycle traits other than respiration or production (e.g. reproduction).
