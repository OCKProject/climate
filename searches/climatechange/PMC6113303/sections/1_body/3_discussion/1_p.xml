<p id="Par20" class="p">Growing experimental evidence indicates that losing species can diminish ecosystems functions such as productivity, biomass accumulation or nutrient uptake. However, the ecosystem consequences of species loss will probably be species-specific as functional performance varies among species

 </sup>. In this context, finding simple proxies to anticipate a speciesâ€™ susceptibility to become extinct will improve our ability to predict the actual consequences of future reductions in species diversity. Our results found that, besides the varying metabolic rates and optimal temperatures recorded in the species examined, the temperature dependence of photosynthesis (as the activation energy

These variation is in agreement with the hypothesis that temperature may have played a pivotal role in the shifts in abundance detected in these species. Furthermore, they also suggest that
