<p id="Par24" class="p">None of the other metabolic traits examined by us showed consistent differences among the two groups of species. Instead, functional responses were species-specific for physiological traits such as

 <sub class="sub">opt</sub>, maximum 
 <italic class="italic">GPP</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">NPP</italic>, dark respiration at

 <sub class="sub">opt</sub>, or photosynthetic efficiency at low irradiance (alpha). Idiosyncratic or species-specific photosynthetic and respiration rates were expected since the seaweed examined here are considerably separated from a phylogenetic point of view. Metabolism in seaweeds is affected not only by the physical environment but also by biotic factors such as morphology, ontogeny, circadian and seasonal rhythms

 </sup>. Studies on intraspecific and interspecific differences in temperature-photosynthesis response curves for many seaweed species indicate that both the amplitude and the position of the curve are usually correlated with the local temperature regime, reflecting local temperature adaptation
