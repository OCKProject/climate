 </sup>. In the North Atlantic, large shifts in the distribution patterns of marine species have been experienced during glacial-interglacial cycles shaping the contemporary distribution and the genetic structure of seaweed populations

 </sup> have been linked with rising temperatures in our oceans. Our experiment was aimed to characterize functional traits which could be relevant to assess seaweeds vulnerability to ocean warming. Previous, experimental studies have successfully used empirical lethal thresholds to define the current and future distribution of seaweeds across large spatial scales

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>
 </sup>. Here we found consistent differences in the temperature dependence of photosynthesis among species with opposite abundance trends, suggesting divergences in the metabolic scaling with temperature among these groups of seaweeds. Overall, our study supports the idea that temperature could be mechanistic cause of the shifts in abundance observed for these seaweeds in the last decades and provides a relatively simple experimental approach that could be further examined in other seaweeds undergoing similar climate-linked abundance changes.
