<p id="Par7" class="p">Despite the growing number of reports on the impact of global change on the distribution and abundance of seaweeds, few studies have compared the thermal functional response of seaweeds that followed divergent abundance trends in recent years

 </sup>. This study examines the physiological response to an experimental temperature gradient in eight intertidal seaweeds that changed their patterns of site occupancy differently in NW Iberia in the last decades: four that decreased their frequency and four that increased

 </sup>. To provide further support for the role of temperature as a decisive driver of the observed shifts, we tested whether there were consistent differences in the functional responses to temperature shown by each set of seaweeds. The seaweeds targeted in this study are major members of the seaweed assemblage in NW Iberia
