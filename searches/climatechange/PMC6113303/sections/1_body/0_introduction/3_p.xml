 </sup>. In the Northeast Atlantic, some northern cold-adapted canopy forming seaweeds decreased in abundance in recent years while other meridional species with an affinity for warmer temperatures increased in regions such as North Spain, French Brittany, or British Isles

 </sup>. Elsewhere, a rapid climate-driven regime shift has been reported for an extensive portion of the Australian temperate reef communities, where mixed kelps-fucacean canopies were lost after a succession of extreme heat waves and were replaced by persistent seaweed turfs with consequences for fish and marine invertebrate assemblages

 </sup>. Previously, large-scale destructions of kelp forests were observed along the Pacific coasts of America after extreme climatic events but, unlike Australia, these forests recovered as environmental conditions returned to normal
