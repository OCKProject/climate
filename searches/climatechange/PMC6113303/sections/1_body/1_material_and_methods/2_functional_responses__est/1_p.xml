<p id="Par10" class="p">To examine the functional response of the target species to rising temperatures, we assessed the respiration and primary productivity rates over a thermal gradient under controlled laboratory conditions. Respiration and net primary productivity were determined throughout oxygen fluxes by continuously recording (every 30 seconds) the concentration of dissolved O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with a HQ40D oxygen probe (Hach Lange
 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) within incubation chambers. Seaweed individuals were incubated under temperature-controlled conditions in custom-made, sealed methacrylate incubation units (2 L) equipped with a submersible pump to homogenize the medium. Lighting was provided by a variable number of 30 W Biolux Osram
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> fluorescent lamps. The setup allowed the simultaneous and independent incubation of three samples, successively exposed for 20 min (30 min for dark conditions) to seven light intensities (0, 30,108, 237, 557, 971, 1515 µmol photons · m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> · s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Light intensity ranged from light-limited conditions (dark incubation) to light-saturation and allowed us to calculate photosynthesis-irradiance (P-E) curves. Independent P-E curves were constructed at nine temperatures for each species. The experiment included water temperatures normally experienced by seaweeds in NW Iberian along the year (12 °C, 15 °C, 18 °C and 21 °C), but also extremes beyond the limits usually seen in the region (6 °C, 9 °C, 24 °C, 27 °C and 30 °C)

 </sup>. Samples were acclimated to incubation-temperature for 12 h before each experiment. P-E curves for each combination of species and temperature were recorded following a strictly randomized order to avoid any bias. In addition, filtered sea water (5 µm) was used to prevent any spurious influence of phytoplankton on photosynthesis/respiration estimates. The effectiveness of the filtering procedure was repeatedly confirmed along the experiment by recording O
