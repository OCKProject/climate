<p id="Par9" class="p">Live fronds of the eight macroalgal species were collected from intertidal locations in NW Iberia in February 2016. The study included Fucales with apical growth (
 <italic class="italic">H. elongata, F. vesiculosus, C. baccata, C. tamariscifolia, B. bifurcata</italic>) and multiaxial red algae with pseudoparenchymatous tissues where the growth of new tissue is not restricted to a meristematic region (
 <italic class="italic">M. stellatus, C. crispus, C. caespitosa</italic>). To guarantee that the functional responses were consistently recorded in metabolically active tissue, samples consisted of whole fronds in the case of the pseudoparenchymatous red algae and the moderately sized 
 <italic class="italic">B. bifurcata</italic>. By contrast, the samples of large-sized Fucales consisted of moderately sized young plants (
 <italic class="italic">F. vesiculosus</italic>), plants with young receptacles (
 <italic class="italic">H. elongata</italic>), or distal, young apical fronds (
 <italic class="italic">C. tamariscifolia</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. baccata</italic>) were used for convenience (frond size 15 cm long in all cases). As a result, whole fronds samples and young frond/tissue regions were evenly partitioned between the two trend sets compared in our experimental design. Samples were transported in a portable cool box to the laboratory where grazers and epiphytic organism were carefully removed. For each species, a subset of evenly sized specimens was acclimated to laboratory conditions before the experiment during two weeks with aerated sea water at around 13 °C; water was renewed every two days along the acclimation period to avoid nutrient depletion.
