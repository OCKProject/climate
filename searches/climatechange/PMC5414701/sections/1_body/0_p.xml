<p class="p">Under the Paris Agreement of the UN's 21st Conference of the Parties, over 100 nations signed up to the goal of keeping future warming within 2째C of pre-industrial levels, and ideally below 1.5째C. Yet anthropogenic CO

 <xref rid="RSBL20170149C1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Accumulation of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other human-caused greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has already driven global warming of approximately 1째C. If warming continues at the current rate, the aspirational target of 1.5째C will be out of reach within 30 years.
