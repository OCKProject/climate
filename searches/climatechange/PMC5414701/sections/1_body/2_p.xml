<p class="p">A range of potential techniques for extracting CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere is being investigated that afford opportunities for mitigating and ameliorating climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSBL20170149F1" class="xref">figureÂ 1</xref>), each of which also needs to be understood in terms of feasibility, cost and acceptability [

 <xref rid="RSBL20170149C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The papers in this mini-series address an underdeveloped NET, enhanced rock weathering, with a particular focus on croplands managed for food production and bioenergy. Weathering is a slow natural process removing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere on long timescales of a million years or more. During weathering, silicate rocks are chemically broken down to release base cations and generate bicarbonate, which is ultimately transferred to the oceans leading to carbonate precipitation on the seafloor. These processes can be accelerated by amending soils with crushed calcium and magnesium-bearing silicate rocks with a high reactive surface area to deliver effective carbon sequestration in soils and the oceans [

 <xref rid="RSBL20170149C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Enhanced weathering is also co-deployable with forestry and crops used in BECCS, enhancing its carbon sequestration potential and reducing costs. Reduced atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in combination with the production of soluble alkalinity from weathered rocks, can help reduce ocean acidification to protect coral reefs and marine fisheries [
