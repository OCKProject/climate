<p id="Par11" class="p">Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22 (IBM). The effect of experimental site, herbivory treatment (open or closed cages) and region of plant origin on plant growth and total herbivore damage were tested with linear mixed models. Experimental site, herbivory treatment and region of plant origin were added as fixed factors; population was added to the model as random factor nested in region of origin. The x and y coordinates of plant position in the experimental plots were added as covariates (row and column number). Data were transformed where needed to meet the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity [shoot biomass and no. shoots: square root, no. of flower stalks: ranks, percentage damage: arcsine (August measurement) and ranks (June measurement)]. Significant differences between groups were tested with Tukey post hoc tests. Differences between regions of plant origin in spider mite infections were tested with similar mixed models but for the Czech site only [data were log (June measurement) and arcsine (August measurement) transformed]. Due to interdependency of the data, the effect of experimental site and region of plant origin on the proportion of leaf damage types, i.e. proportion mining, shot holes or chewing damage, were analyzed with MANOVA models on rank transformed data. In these MANOVA models, the random effect population was not included. The effect of experimental site, plant origin and herbivory treatment on the concentrations of the individual glucosinolates (Î¼M/mg dw) was tested with the linear nested mixed models described above. In addition, differences in glucosinolate composition were analyzed with a Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) on the relative abundances of individual glucosinolates (percentage of total glucosinolate concentration) in R 3.3.0 (
