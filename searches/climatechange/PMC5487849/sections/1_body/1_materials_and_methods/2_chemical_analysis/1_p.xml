<p id="Par9" class="p">Leaf samples were taken from the Wageningen (NL) and Průhonice (CZ) experimental sites at the time of shoot biomass harvest at the end of the experiment. Due to technical limitations, this was not possible at the site in Germany. Two leaves per plant, the fourth and fifth leaves from the top, were harvested, directly flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, freeze-dried, and stored at −20 °C until chemical analyses. Samples were pooled per population and herbivory treatment to reduce the amount of samples. This resulted in 48 samples in total (12 populations × 2 herbivore treatments × 2 sites).</p>
