<p id="Par10" class="p">For glucosinolate analyses, the freeze-dried leaf samples were ground with a mortar and pestle, 75 mg dry material was weighed in a 2 ml Eppendorf tube and extracted twice with 1 ml of 70% methanol solution and 15 min of ultra-sonification. During the first extraction round, the tube was placed in a hot (90 °C) water bath for 10 min, right after the addition of the methanol to immediately kill myrosinase activity. After the sonification, the tubes were centrifuged at 4500 rpm (2975 rcf) for 10 min. The supernatants were combined and added to a DEAE Sephadex A 25 column (Sigma-Aldrich). After washing the columns with 2 × 1 ml 70% MeOH and 2 × 1 ml MilliQ water and 1 × 1 ml NaOAC buffer (20 mM, pH = 5.5.), 20 μl containing 10 units arylsulfatase (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the column and left overnight. The desulphated glucosinolates were eluted from the column with 2 × 0.75 ml milliQ water. The combined eluate was freeze dried and redissolved in 1.0 ml MilliQ. The desulphoglucosinolates were separated using high-performance liquid chromatography (DIONEX summit HPLC, DIONEX, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) on a reversed phase C-18 column (Alltima C-18, 150 mm length x 4.6 mm o.d., 3 μm particle size, Alltech, Deerfield, IL, USA) with an acetonitrile–water gradient (2–35% acetonitrile from 0 to 30 min; flow 0.75 ml min

Five reference sinigrin samples in the range 50–650 μM were used to generate a calibration curve. We used the correction factors for detection at 229 nm from Buchner (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2003</xref>) to calculate the concentrations of the different types of glucosinolates based on the sinigrin reference curve. Glucosinolates were identified based on retention time, UV spectrum, LC–MS analysis of selected reference samples and commercially bought standards.
