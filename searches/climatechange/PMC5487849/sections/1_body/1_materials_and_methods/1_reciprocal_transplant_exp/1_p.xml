<p id="Par6" class="p">Plants of 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> from seven populations of the novel range and five populations of the core edge were collected in the field between May and October 2011 by digging out parts of the roots. In each population, a minimum of 10 plants were collected which grew at least 5 m apart. Five populations were sampled in the Netherlands (novel range), two populations in southern Germany (novel range), and five populations in the Czech Republic (core edge) (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table S1 and Huberty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>; Dostalek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>). For comparisons between core populations and populations of the novel range, ideally the source populations from which the novel populations originated should be compared. Population genetic analyses using SNPs showed that the core edge Czech populations were more related to the German and Dutch populations in the novel range than 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> populations from the core distribution in Hungary or Romania (Macel M. et al., unpublished data). All plants were checked for ploidy levels with flow cytometry, and were confirmed to be diploid with genome size corresponding to 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic>. Potential hybrids between 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> and other 
 <italic class="italic">Rorippa</italic> species would have been polyploid (Bleeker and Matthies 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2005</xref>). All field-collected plants were first grown in the same soil, 1:1 mixture of potting soil and sand, in 3 L pots in a common garden in Tübingen (Germany) for 7 months. Each plant was then propagated via root cuttings at the end of April 2012. Six root pieces of 3 mm diameter × 5 cm length were cut off per plant. Two root cuttings of each plant were sent by mail to the Czech Republic and two cuttings per plant to the Netherlands.
