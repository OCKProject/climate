<p id="Par8" class="p">During the growing season, plant performance was measured twice, once in middle of the season (end of June) and once at the end of August. Herbivore damage, plant size and number of flowers were recorded. Height of the longest shoot was measured and the number of side shoots and flowering shoots counted. Percentage total herbivore damage was estimated on a standardized subset of seven leaves of each plant; the youngest and oldest fully grown leaves and five randomly chosen in between, and the average of these seven leaves was used in the analyses. Additionally, at the Czech site the percentage leaf area infected with spider mites (leaf area covered with spider mite webs) was estimated on the same seven leaves. The other type of leaf damage was roughly estimated as fraction of total damage (spider mite infection excluded) in three types: (1) shot holes caused by adult flea beetles (Chrysomelidae), (2) leaf mining caused by flea beetle larvae (
 <italic class="italic">Phyllotreta nemorum</italic>) and leaf mining flies and (3) leaf removal caused by chewing herbivores such as caterpillars, grasshoppers and slugs (e.g., 80% shot holes, 20% chewing). The herbivores that were spotted on the plants were identified where possible to species level or to genus/family level. In total, the experiment ran for four months, and was ended when the first plants completely filled up the cages. This was done to avoid that with time plant growth would be limited by cage size (a ‘cage saturation’ effect). The aboveground biomass was harvested, dried at 60 °C for 4 days and weighed.
