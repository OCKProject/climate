<p id="Par7" class="p">Three experimental common gardens were set up in May 2012: Wageningen (The Netherlands) 51°58′N 5°40′E, Tübingen (Germany) 48°31′N 9°03′E, and Průhonice (Czech Republic) 50°0′N 14°56′E (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Average temperatures in the regions during the course of the experiment were 16.3° C (Wageningen), 17.9° C (Tübingen) and 17.6° C (Průhonice). Average monthly precipitation was 87 mm (Wageningen), 66 mm (Tübingen) and 74 mm (Průhonice) (sources:

These experimental sites were in each of the three regions of plant origin, and distances between the regional populations used in the experiment and the experimental sites were: Wageningen 4–99 km, Tübingen 71–75 km, Průhonice 11–139 km. In each experimental site, two clones (two root cuttings) of each plant were grown, in total 240 plants per site (12 populations × 10 plants × 2 clones). Each root cutting was planted in a 3 L pot with 1:1 sand—potting soil mixture. Pots were placed 75 cm apart in a 12 × 15 m fenced-off plot in a completely randomized design. The plot was covered with root foil (polypropylene) to suppress the growth of other plants in the plot. The pots were watered when needed in the beginning of the experiment (first month) to enable good establishment of the plants. All plants were covered with mesh bags (polyamide, 0.75 m width × 1.20 m length, 0.7 mm × 0.8 mm mesh size), but for half of the plants (one of the two clones) the mesh bags were opened on one vertical side. The mesh bags on the other half of the plants were kept closed to exclude most insects and other herbivores. The mesh bags were held upright by bamboo and iron sticks.
