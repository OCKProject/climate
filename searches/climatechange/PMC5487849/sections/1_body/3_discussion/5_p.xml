<p id="Par26" class="p">Differentiation in herbivore resistance between native and exotic populations of introduced invasive plants is common (Doorduin and Vrieling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2011</xref>; Felker-Quinn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>), but evolution of resistance/defenses is not well documented for range expanding plants. In range expanding algae, resistance towards generalist herbivores was lower in core populations to populations in the extended range (Nylund et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2012</xref>). In contrast, resistance against a generalist caterpillar was higher in core populations of the range expanding plant 
 <italic class="italic">Bunias orientalis</italic> (Fortuna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2014</xref>). Interestingly, our results suggested that core edge Czech 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> were less resistant to herbivory than the German and Dutch populations of the novel range at the slug dominated north-western site. Differentiation in chemical defenses could play a role in this resistance. Slugs are known to be sensitive to glucosinolates (Lankau 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2007</xref>; Falk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2014</xref>; Moshgani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>). Specialist herbivores, on the other hand, can use glucosinolates as feeding and oviposition cues (Renwick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">1992</xref>). Overall levels of glucosinolates were similar between 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> from the core edge and the novel range, but glucohirsutin was higher in the core populations and neoglucobrassicin was higher in the populations of the novel range. Correlations between damage and these two compounds were opposite between the core Czech site and the Dutch site in the novel range. Therefore, these subtle differences in glucosinolate profiles between the 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> origins could indicate shifts in selection by herbivores for individual glucosinolates (Gols et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2008</xref>; ZÃ¼st et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). There was also a stronger induction of neoglucobrassicin in the genotypes from the novel range compared to the core genotypes. Upon attack plants can induce the levels of chemical defenses (Karban and Baldwin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">1997</xref>). Higher inducibility of defenses of exotic populations compared to native populations has received little attention thus far, but this could be an adaptation to lower or less predictable enemy attack in the introduced or extended range (Cipollini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2005</xref>; Cipollini and Lieurance 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2012</xref>; Gu et al.
