<p id="Par24" class="p">For invasive species, alternative explanations to enemy release and the EICA hypothesis for the increased vigor of exotic genotypes have been formulated (Colautti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2004</xref>). One possibility could be admixture whereby genotypes that were previously isolated in the native range hybridize in the new range which can lead to increased vigor of the offspring (hybrid vigor) (Ellstrand and Schierenbeck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2006</xref>; Verhoeven et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, hybridization and genetic introgression in the 
 <italic class="italic">Rorippa</italic> genus is common (Bleeker and Hurka 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2001</xref>). We excluded hybrids from our study but we cannot be completely sure that there was no genetic introgression in any of the 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> genotypes we tested. Another possibility could be that there is a trade-off between growth and another trait (not herbivore resistance). For example, in an additional experiment, the Dutch populations of the novel range showed no allelopathic effects while the core edge Czech populations had a negative allelopathic effect on a co-occurring grass species (Dostalek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>). Possibly, there is a trade-off between allelopathy and growth, and loss/lack of allelopathy is accompanied by increased growth in the populations of the novel range.
