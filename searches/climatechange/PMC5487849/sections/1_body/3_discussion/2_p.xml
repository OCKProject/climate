<p id="Par23" class="p">Increased size or vigor of exotic genotypes compared to genotypes of the native range has often been found in introduced invasive species (e.g., Willis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">1999</xref>; Torchin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2001</xref>; Jakobs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2004</xref>; Abela-Hofbauerova and Munzbergova 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2011</xref>; but see Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2006</xref>). One of the popular hypotheses that offers an evolutionary explanation for this is the Evolution of Increased Competitive Ability (EICA) hypothesis (Blossey and NÃ¶tzold 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">1995</xref>). In the introduced range plants that invest less in defense and more into growth can be favored through enemy release, which enables a shift in allocation from defense to growth. In our experiment, however, herbivory was more and not less severe at the two sites in the novel range compared to the core edge site. Release from enemies is thus not a likely explanation for the observed increased vigor of the populations of the novel range although we only tested one core site and one growing season. The increased vigor of 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> from the novel range was consistent with the results of other experiments using the same populations (Dostalek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016</xref>; J. Cross and M. Huberty, unpublished data). This increased vigor is also consistent with other findings from invasive 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic>: exotic North American 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> were also larger compared to native populations but herbivore resistance (to slugs) was the same between the European and North American origins (Buschmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2005</xref>). These results suggest that other mechanisms are responsible for the increased plant growth of 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> in its introduced or expanding range.
