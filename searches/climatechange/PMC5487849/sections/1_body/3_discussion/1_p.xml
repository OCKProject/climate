<p id="Par22" class="p">Here, we tested whether a range expanding plant has rapidly adapted to the regional conditions in its novel range and if so, whether such adaptation was driven by interactions with herbivores. Our results indicate that there is no regional adaptation to abiotic conditions such as climate, although we did not test adaptation to local soil types and only examined a relatively short window of the entire life span of this perennial plant. Interestingly, herbivore damage was not lowest but highest at the sites in the new range, and our data suggest that plants from the novel range have evolved increased herbivore resistance and increased vigor. Plants originating from the newly colonized regions in the Netherlands and Germany were larger than the core edge Czech plants at all sites. Most plants were negatively affected by herbivory but also under herbivory plants from the novel range grew larger than the core edge plants at all sites. This indicates genetic differentiation in size between plants from the novel range and core plants which is independent of environmental factors. There was also a plastic response to the different environmental conditions at the three sites, as plants grew overall biggest at the German site and were smallest at the most northern site in the Netherlands.</p>
