<p id="Par25" class="p">Range expanding plants have been shown to lose a part of their specialist enemies from the core range (Lakeman-Fraser and Ewers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>), but similar to introduced invasive species they are also likely to encounter new generalist herbivores which can provide biotic resistance of the native communities towards invading exotic species (Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2006</xref>; Brown and Vellend 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2014</xref>; Alofs and Jackson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2015</xref>). Strikingly, herbivores had a higher impact on 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> performance in the novel range compared to the core edge in our experiment. Our most Northern site in the novel range (Wageningen, The Netherlands) with most herbivore damage (up to 67%) was dominated by generalist slug herbivory. Slug herbivory is likely to be important for determining plant abundance in Northern European regions with high rainfall (Bruelheide and Scheidel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">1999</xref>). The South German site in the novel range had similar insect herbivore communities to core edge Czech site, but there was more damage earlier on in the season in Germany. The presence of Brassicaceae specialist insects was higher at these southern sites compared to the more northern Dutch site. However, most, if not all, insect species listed at the German and Czech sites in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> are also currently present in the Netherlands, although not on 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> at our Dutch experimental site (

Thus, even though our results could be due to a local site effect, it also shows that damage from generalist herbivores can be severe in the northern new range. Similar patterns of more herbivory in the extended range were found for range expanding algae (Nylund et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2012</xref>). Experiments with replicated sites at each latitude would indicate whether the herbivory pattern that we found here is a general latitudinal pattern.
