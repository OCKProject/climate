<p id="Par27" class="p">Species that are expanding their range to higher latitudes can include potential invaders that are less affected by herbivores compared to native species (Engelkes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2008</xref>). Here, we showed that these range expanders can also have increased vigor in the extended range compared to core populations, a trait often found in invasive species. This increased growth was accompanied by subtle shifts in defenses and higher inducibility of a particular defense compound. Mechanisms behind this differentiation of the novel populations remain to be elucidated. 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> can be abundant in riverine areas in its novel range (Bleeker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2003</xref>) and is considered a weed in agriculture in its core distribution. From a biological conservation perspective, it is desirable that species are able to shift their ranges in response to climate change, because it is one of the ways for species to possibly avoid extinction (Berg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2010</xref>). However, these range expanding species may include potential invaders or could evolve invasive traits in their novel range. Theories that have been applied to explain invasive success of exotic species from other continents could perhaps (partly) also be applied to the successful spread and abundance of these range expanders, a process about which we still know very little (Moran and Alexander 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2014</xref>).
