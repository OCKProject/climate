 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2003</xref>; Gonzalez-Megias et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2008</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2011</xref>). For example, global warming is shifting species distribution limits towards the poles (Hickling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2006</xref>). Not all speciesâ€™ distributions will change at the same speed, if they can change at all (Berg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, current range expansions or range shifts may lead to shifts in biotic interactions because interacting organisms may not move all at the same pace (Van der Putten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2010</xref>). Range expanding species are thus likely to encounter different abiotic as well as biotic environments in their new range. These novel selection pressures during range expansion could lead to rapid adaptive evolution of the species in the new range (Buckley and Bridle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014</xref>). Understanding how species respond to these new abiotic and biotic environments is crucial to our knowledge about the biological effects of global warming.
