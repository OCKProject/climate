<p id="Par3" class="p">Evolutionary processes can differ between the core and edge populations of a species’ range (Kirkpatrick and Barton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">1997</xref>). As an example, evolution in range edge populations is thought to be affected by the level of gene flow from core populations, where adaptation in the range edge can be constrained by too little gene flow (providing insufficient variation for adaptive responses to selection) or too much gene flow (swamping incipient adaptation). For currently range expanding species, both evolutionary and ecological processes in the populations in the new extended range may, therefore, be different compared to the native range (Sexton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2009</xref>). Shifts in selection on species traits by the new abiotic and biotic environments may be strong enough to lead to adaptive differentiation between the new range edge and the native range. For example, plant–herbivore interactions can change, causing novel and strong selection on plant traits such as defenses (Nylund et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2012</xref>). Loss or partial loss of natural enemies can occur during range expansion, which can further promote successful range expansion (Menendez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lakeman-Fraser and Ewers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>). In addition, some insects are moving to novel host plants in their extended range and have adapted to these new host species (Buckley and Bridle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014</xref>). Multiple examples from invasion biology illustrate that altered plant–herbivore interactions can cause a shift in chemical defenses as well as plant growth (e.g., Blossey and Nötzold 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">1995</xref>; Joshi and Vrieling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2005</xref>). For instance, recent studies showed that rapid evolution of invasive plant populations led to higher resistance to belowground herbivores and higher toxin levels (Zheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2015</xref>) or better defense against aboveground generalist herbivores but greater susceptibility to specialists compared to native genotypes (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2016</xref>).
