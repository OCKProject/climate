<p id="Par4" class="p">Thus far, little is known about (adaptive) evolution of plants that are currently expanding their range due to global warming. Adaptation of plants to their local environments can be tested using reciprocal transplant approaches. Higher performance of genotypes in their home environment compared to foreign environments and/or higher performance of the local genotypes compared to the foreign genotypes within a site would indicate local adaptation (e.g., Joshi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2001</xref>; Kawecki and Ebert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2004</xref>). Using such comparisons, the contribution of environmental and genetic factors to species performance can be assessed. Such approaches can also be used to test the performance of plants outside of their present range by including an experimental transplant site that is located in the future predicted range (Marsico and Hellmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2009</xref>; Lakeman-Fraser and Ewers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2013</xref>). Although there have been many transplant studies on plant local adaptation (reviewed in Leimu and Fischer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2008</xref>), not many of these field studies have experimentally assessed specific biotic or abiotic factors driving local adaptation in plants (but see Macel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2007</xref>; Bischoff and Hurault 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pankova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2014</xref>). Here, we used a reciprocal transplant approach with herbivore manipulation to test whether a range expanding plant species has rapidly adapted to the environment in its novel range, and whether such adaptation is driven mainly by interactions with herbivores or by other factors such as abiotic conditions.
