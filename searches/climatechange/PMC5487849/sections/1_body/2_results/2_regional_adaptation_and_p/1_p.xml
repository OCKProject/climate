<p id="Par13" class="p">Experimental site had a significant effect on all measured plant traits (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Overall, plants were the smallest at the Dutch experimental site and the largest at the German site, which was reflected throughout the growing season in plant height, shoot number, number of flower stalks and final shoot biomass (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, Fig S1). Region of plant origin (Czech Republic, Netherlands, Germany) also had a significant overall effect on most of the plant traits, except on herbivore damage (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). At all sites, the Czech plants from the core edge were smaller than the plants from the novel range (German and Dutch origins) which were equally big (Table
