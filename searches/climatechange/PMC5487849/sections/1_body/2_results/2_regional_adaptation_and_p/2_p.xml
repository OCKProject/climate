<p id="Par14" class="p">A significant interaction between environment and genotype can be an indication for adaptation to local environments. Here, the interaction between experimental site x region of plant origin was not significant for any of the measured traits (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), except for number of flower stalks in June. This general lack of significant site x plant origin interaction indicates no local advantage and thus no regional adaptation of the 
 <italic class="italic">R. austriaca</italic> populations. As for flower production in June, no flowers were produced at the Dutch site then. At German site at that time, number of flower stalks did not differ among plants from the different regions (post hoc Tukey, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). At the Czech site in the core edge, the Czech plants produced less flower stalks than the Dutch plants in June (post hoc Tukey 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.007). In August, the Czech plants produced less flower stalks than the Dutch and German plants at the Czech and German sites (post hoc Tukey tests 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Although the interaction between experimental site × region of plant origin was significant for this trait in June, the results do not indicate a local 
 <italic class="italic">vs.</italic> foreign advantage, but rather a local disadvantage.
