<p id="Par20" class="p">The analyses of the chemical defenses, the glucosinolates, showed small differences between the plant origins, particularly among plants in the herbivory treatment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Table S3). Dutch populations from the novel range had overall higher amounts of the indole glucosinolate neoglucobrassicin (NEO) and lower levels of glucohirsutin (HIR) compared to the core edge Czech plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Table S3, Fig S2). Neoglucobrassicin was induced by the herbivory treatment, especially in the plants from the novel range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>; Table S3 significant herbivory treatment × plant origin interaction, Fig. S2). Total glucosinolate concentrations did not differ between the plant origins. Site had a significant effect on the concentrations of most glucosinolates. Concentrations were higher at the Dutch site (Table S3; Fig S2).
