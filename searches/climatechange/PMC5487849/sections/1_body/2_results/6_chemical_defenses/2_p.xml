<p id="Par21" class="p">Using average estimates of traits (glucosinolates, biomass) for each population (12 populations in total), there were no significant correlations between total glucosinolate concentrations and plant biomass for any of the experimental site x treatment combinations. Within the herbivory treatment, at the core edge Czech site damage was positively correlated with total glucosinolate levels (
