<p id="Par16" class="p">The experimental site × herbivory treatment interaction was significant for most plant traits, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. This was due to the lower impact of herbivory on plant performance at the core edge Czech site compared to the other sites. However, there was no significant interaction between region of plant origin and herbivory treatment for any measured trait (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). There was no significant three-way interaction between experimental site, plant origin and herbivory treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The pattern that the core edge plants were smaller than the plants from the novel range remained the same with and without herbivory at all sites.
