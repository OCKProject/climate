<p id="Par26" class="p">Studies typically kept air pollution or anthropogenic emissions constant or projected future emissions. Where future emissions were projected to decrease, significant decreases in pollution levels were expected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. However, even under these conditions, studies did not project such a big decrease for Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] and in some areas, climate change might increase the air pollution-related health burdens due to aging population which increases the proportion of vulnerable persons and/or migration, even as air pollution emissions decrease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>â€¢, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Additionally, decreases in future emission can be lower than those that the earlier studies projected because currently there have been disagreements between current emission inventory estimates and earlier projections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. For example, under the SSP3 and SSP4 (shared socioeconomic pathway) scenarios, economic, institutional and technological limitations slow air quality improvements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>] such that projected global pollutant emissions over the twenty-first century may be comparable to current levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Nevertheless, the air pollution models are highly sensitive to the input emission data and if the real future emission would not follow the projected trends, the hereafter conclusions could be significantly different.
