<p id="Par28" class="p">The choice of the climate change model used in the projections could be significant, with increasing or even decreasing effects expected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. This means that models could under- or overestimate the actual effects. The main uncertainties could rise from model parameters and/or interactions between climate and air quality, often characteristic to a certain region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. To address these uncertainties, an ensemble of models and a downscaling technique should be applied. But as was shown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>] and in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, often, a single global climate projection was used, probably due to the accessibility and capacity of computational resources.
