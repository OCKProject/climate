<p id="Par27" class="p">The majority of studies applied different air chemistry–transport models. Two studies also applied statistical models. Alexeeff et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] applied Bayesian modelling and Wilson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] spatial monotone modelling. The spatial coverage of chemistry–transport is in general better, but still rather crude, often 0.5°, due to large computational resources needed. In general, the magnitude of effects in chemistry–transport and statistical models is similar, but different climate change projections, time periods and baseline data were applied, meaning it is very difficult to compare the results in detail.
