<p id="Par30" class="p">Using the current CRFs, mortality rates and exposed population at baseline could also introduce errors into the projected air pollution-related health impacts of climate change because of demographic changes, socioeconomic development and other factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>]. Several studies used future populations in future assessments, which provide more confidence in the projected risks (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For instance, Wilson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] projected significantly higher (39.8 vs 7.7) percent change in excess mortality attributable to ozone concentrations above 40Â ppb if population changes by 2030 were taken into account. Not all studies used these projected estimates, however. Similarly, another source of uncertainty pertains to the timing of the mortality rates used given an overall decreasing trend in age-standardized death rate over recent decades, although the rate of decrease appears to have slowed for cardiovascular and other air pollution-related diseases during the last years in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]. Therefore, careful consideration should be made regarding the mortality rates adopted as following the earlier trends could overestimate future effects.
