<p id="Par5" class="p">Several studies indicate that climate change has already affected air quality. For instance, Fang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] simulated that from pre-industrial (1860) to present (2000), the global population-weighted fine particle (PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>) concentrations increased by 5% and near-surface ozone concentrations by 2% due to climate change. According to Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>•], the change from pre-industrial resulted in up to 111,000 and 21,400 additional premature fine particle- and ozone-related deaths due to climate change, respectively. Over the last two decades, roughly every degree of warming (°F) in the observed data was associated with an increase of 1.2 ppb in ozone concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. As the climate continues to change, these impacts are projected to continue in the future.
