<p id="Par34" class="p">Since the future health burdens of air pollutants, particularly PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> and ozone, will depend on actions taken to reduce the responsible emissions, better understanding is needed of the emissions of air pollutants under multiple development pathways. Therefore, increased investment in understanding the range of possible future health risks of changes in air pollution under a range of future possible climates and emissions is critical to inform regulations. Because current emissions have exceeded the projected trends [
