<p id="Par33" class="p">Another key research need for future studies is to compare the health burdens of future air quality under a changing climate with alterations in other risk factors due to climate change. For example, only one study jointly compared the effects of air pollution and temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>â€¢]. Even if air pollution health risks might decrease because of emission reductions, ambient temperatures and heat waves are still expected to increase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. Further understanding is needed because exposure to higher temperatures and higher concentrations of air pollutants may have synergistic effects, especially on cardiovascular disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>], causing even higher health burdens than exposure to each individually. Understanding where this could occur would inform regulations of emissions to help reduce future health burdens. Similarly, indoor air quality will likely be impacted by climate change via mechanisms like mould growth as climate change increases the probability of storms and flooding that can impact health [
