<p id="Par10" class="p">Near-surface ozone is another secondary pollutant formed from the interaction of precursor compounds with sunlight, including UV radiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The rate of formation is temperature-dependent. Because of this, sunny and cloudless days and higher temperatures are more conducive to higher ozone concentrations. Wind can control ozone levels by dispersing precursor species, thus reducing ozone formation. Dry deposition (to vegetation, surfaces) also removes ground-level ozone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The formation of near-surface ozone is the result of chemical reactions that depend on ozone precursor emissions from natural and anthropogenic sources. The main precursors include several primary and other secondary pollutants such as VOCs, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and CO that react with hydroxyl radical (OH) to ultimately produce ground-level ozone (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Increasing temperatures due to climate change generally lead to increased natural VOC emissions that affect ozone concentrations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Further, hydroxyl radical formation is associated with methane, another greenhouse gas [
