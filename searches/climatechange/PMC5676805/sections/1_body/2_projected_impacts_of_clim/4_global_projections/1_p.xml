<p id="Par16" class="p">Three studies over the last 5 years projected globally how climate change could affect mortality; all included analyses of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>- and ozone-related mortalities (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). One study conducted by Likhvar et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>] included all of the world in current climate assessment, but included future climate projections only for France and for all of Europe, with global emission change taken into account. Fang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>•] also analysed one climate change projection, while Silva et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] used four. Using more than one projection of climate change provides insights into the range of uncertainties about future air quality and associated health impacts. Overall, climate is expected to increase PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>- and ozone-related mortalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>•], peaking in 2030 and 2050, respectively, followed by a decrease due to reductions in emissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] that outweigh the effects of climate change. The measures reducing emissions include adopting and enforcing next-generation standards and policies (more stringent than Euro 6/VI) that could reduce significantly premature mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Larger climate change effects are expected globally (especially in Asia) due to projected increases in PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>, with less impact of climate change on ozone-related mortality; Fang et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>•] projected a 4 and 0.9% increase in mortality associated with these pollutants by the end of the century, respectively.
