 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. In addition, in one global study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>], Europe was one of the included regions; however, the effects of climate change were combined with effects from emission change (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In their projections, Orru et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] projected climate effects only on ozone-related mortality, keeping all other factors constant. Larger effects were observed with higher greenhouse gas emissions (the A2 scenario) compared to lower greenhouse gas emissions (A1B), with much larger effects expected by the middle of the century compared to today. The A2 scenario represents a very heterogeneous world with high population growth and relatively rapid economic development based on fossil fuels, whereas A1B reflects introductions of new and more efficient technologies after rapid economic growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. There also were large regional differences under these two scenarios: a large increase was projected in central and southern Europe, whereas decreasing effects are expected in northern Europe. Geels et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] also included changes in emissions, population and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> infiltration (future tighter buildings) in their modelled scenarios and assessments. Their projections suggested up to two times larger effects of climate at the end of the century compared to the 2050s. Changes in emissions would outweigh the effects, with large decreases (36â€“84%) projected in ozone- and PM
