<p id="Par19" class="p">Five studies recently projected health risks for the entire USA; one study included a large number of US urban areas and one the Atlanta metropolitan area only (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Five studies focused on ozone and two on ozone and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>. In general, all studies projected increases in ozone- and PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub>-related mortalities due to climate change. Among the studies, Garcia-Menendez et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] was different because two policy scenarios were compared, and both projections indicated a large number of avoided deaths compared to a no-policy scenario. The number of avoided deaths increased with a stricter greenhouse gas scenario (3.7 vs 4.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). Other studies frequently used the A2 emission scenario, similar to the currently more widely applied representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, finding larger health risks of climate change than under lower emission scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). RCPs are four greenhouse gas emission trajectories resulting in specific levels of radiative forcing in 2100; these reflect the possible range of radiative forcing values in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values (+ 2.6, + 4.5, + 6.0 and +8.5 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. IPCC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] has defined radiative forcing as the change in net (down minus up) irradiance (solar plus longwave; in W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) at the tropopause after allowing for stratospheric temperatures to readjust to radiative equilibrium, but with surface and tropospheric temperatures and states held fixed at the unperturbed values.
