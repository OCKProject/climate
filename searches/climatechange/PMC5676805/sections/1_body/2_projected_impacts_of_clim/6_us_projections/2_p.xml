<p id="Par20" class="p">In other studies, Fann et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] have projected the health risks until the 2030s to be smaller than those projected to be experienced in the middle of the century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>], with even larger risks by the end of the century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Climate change will increase exposures to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone; the magnitude of risks will depend on the threshold assumed (e.g. if we expect ozone health effects starting at 70 ppb as the National Ambient Air Quality Standard in the USA compared with the 35 ppb that has been often used in health impact assessments) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. As with projections from Europe, the effects of emission change are expected to outweigh the effects of climate change, resulting in smaller air pollution-related health burdens in the future [
