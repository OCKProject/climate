<p class="p">Twenty years ago the association between health and climate change was the concern of a small number of scientists. Now climate change is recognized by the world’s international agencies as an unprecedented threat to human health and well-being. In his opening address to the first World Health Organization Conference on Climate Change and Health, held in Geneva in August 2014, Jim Yong Kim – President of the World Bank – acknowledged that climate change, health and international development are inseparable. Although recognition of this kind is a significant sign of progress on the climate change and health agenda, substantial action on climate change is likely to be achieved only with major changes to the world’s economy.
