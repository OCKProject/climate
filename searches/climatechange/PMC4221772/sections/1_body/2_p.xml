<p class="p">We now have some idea of where the largest risks lie – i.e. the risks posed by the high-end climate scenarios in which the mean global temperature rises to about 4 °C above its pre-industrial values by 2100. The IPCC’s fifth assessment report

  <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 </xref> argues that we should take such risks seriously for three main reasons. First, emissions of greenhouse gases show annual growth that approximates the result of the IPCC’s worst scenario model. Second, in the same scenario, the climate does not stabilize in 2100 but carries on warming until the global mean temperature exceeds its pre-industrial levels by about 10–12 °C.

For example, an exponential rise in the risk of catastrophic weather events, exposure of essential food crops to lethal temperatures, and unprecedented periods of high temperatures and high humidity would overwhelm human adaptive capacity.
