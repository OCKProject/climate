<p class="p">Most relevant research in the 1990s and 2000s focused on the effects of climate change on health, without any detailed assessment of the effects of changes in other important drivers of health. However, we now have studies that model the effects of climate change and possible future social, demographic and economic trends. We therefore have a much more detailed and policy-relevant picture of future risks and vulnerabilities. For example, a recent risk assessment of the effects of climate change on selected causes of mortality, cites several such studies that focused on undernutrition.
