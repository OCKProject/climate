<p class="p">In general, single climatic factor (temperature/precipitation) change will have an obvious effect on the TN and TP loads in the LRB. The underlying surface change will also affect the surface water quality in the basin. The greater the reduction of natural land use, the greater the increase of pollution load in the basin. The incidence of TN and TP pollution is more sensitive to LUCC than single climatic factor change. The incidence of TN pollution will augment in the future, while it will decrease with TP pollution. The evolution characteristics of surface water quality in this paper can provide references for climate change and LUCC change study, and also can support the effect and adaptation-strategies study. Certainly, there are various uncertainties of the impact of climate change and underlying surface change on surface water quality, and following research should focus on basin water quality models, climate models, extreme events, and LUCC causes. TN and TP loads are influenced not only by LUCC, but also by point-source pollution, WWTP efficiencies, “good practice” in agriculture, and so on. The further study can focus on the comprehensive effects of mentioned factors on the TN and TP loads.</p>
