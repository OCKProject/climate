   <p class="p">In the past 55 years (from 1963 to 2017), the average annual temperature increased 0.69 °C/10 years. The average daily precipitation varied alternately between 0.5 and 1.6 mm. In the next 30 years (from 2020 to 2050), the average annual temperature will increase by above 0.58 °C/10 years compared with the reference period (from 1963 to 2017). The increase rate of precipitation will be different in the middle and lower reaches of the basin (5% to 10%). The climate in the LRB has been getting warmer and more humid. From 1985 to 2014, the natural land use decreased, the human activities land use increased, while the change rate slowed down.</p>

   <p class="p">The TN and TP load was basically inversely proportional to temperature change (except for winter), while it was significantly proportional to precipitation change. Especially in summer, the TN and TP load increased more obviously as precipitation was much higher. Based on the extreme value proportion statistics, the more the temperature or the precipitation changes, the greater the occurrence probability of extreme water pollution events. It can be found that the incidence of TN pollution is sensitive to temperature increase with positive correlation, while it shows a basically negative correlation with TP. Meanwhile, the incidence of TN and TP pollution has no obvious relation with precipitation change.</p>

   <p class="p">Through the Future Climate Change scenario simulation, it can be learned that the mean annual TN and TP loads from 2020 to 2050 is likely slightly lower than those in the reference period (from 1963 to 2017). The load might increase according to the following order: RCP2.6 &lt; RCP4.5 &lt; RCP8.5 &lt; reference period. From the point of view of climate change, the temperature rising effect on the TN and TP loads seems to be more obvious than the precipitation increase effect. Additionally, the incidence of TN pollution is potentially sensitive to the future climate change.</p>

   <p class="p">The TN and TP loads were different under the land use of 1985, 2000 and 2014. The loads and the incidence of water pollution generally show a trend of 1985 &lt; 2014 &lt; 2000, which is in contrast with the natural land use change (2000 &lt; 2014 &lt; 1985). When the natural land use decreases and the human activities land use increases, the TN and TP loads of the basin will increase as well, and the surface water quality of the basin will deteriorate.</p>
