<p class="p">The percentage above (including equal to) the three benchmarks was calculated (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Under the land use dataset of 2014, the extreme value proportions of TN load above the three benchmarks were 19.6% to 22.6%, 7.5% to 11.8%, and 3.9% to 8.0%, respectively; the extreme value proportion of TP loads were 17.3% to 21.6%, 8.0% to 11.6%, and 4.6% to 9.0%, respectively. As the temperature increases (decreases), the proportions of the three types of extreme values decrease (increase). The greater the absolute change value of the temperature, the larger the proportion change of the extreme value.
