<p class="p">Under the Temperature Change scenario, the incidence of TN and TP pollution shows different variation trends (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The incidence of TN pollution shows a positive correlation with temperature change. The greater the absolute change value of the temperature, the larger the change of the incidence. However, there is basically a negative correlation between temperature change and variation of incidence of TP pollution. The TN pollution is more serious than TP pollution in the LRB.
