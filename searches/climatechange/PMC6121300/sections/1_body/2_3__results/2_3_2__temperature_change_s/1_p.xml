Under the land use dataset of 2014, when temperature increased 1 °C, 2 °C, −1 °C or −2 °C compared with the reference period (from 1963 to 2017), the monthly TN load increased by −23.6% to 27.3%, −46.0% to 38.9%, −36.6% to 21.5%, and −66.5% to 42.8%, respectively; the monthly TP load increased by −24.5% to 22.9%, −45.5% to 47.7%, −13.5% to 29.8%, and −35.3% to 80.6%, respectively; the mean annual TN load increased by −12.4%, −23.6%, 13.3% and 27.4%, respectively; and the average annual TP increased by −14.0%, −21.8%, 17.9% and 36.9%, respectively.
