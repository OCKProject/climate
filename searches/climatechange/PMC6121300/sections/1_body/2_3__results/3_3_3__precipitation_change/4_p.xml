<p class="p">TN and TP pollution showed no obvious variation trend under different Precipitation Change scenarios (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t008" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 8</xref>). Among most Precipitation Change scenarios, the incidence of TN and TP pollution will be reduced slightly compared with the reference period. When precipitation increases by 20%, the incidence of TN and TP pollution decreases the most. Also, the TN pollution is more serious than TP pollution in the LRB.
