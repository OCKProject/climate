<p class="p">As can been seen in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>, under the land use of 2014, the extreme value proportions of TN load above the three benchmarks were 12.4% to 27.5%, 5.6% to 15.0%, and 2.3% to 10.1%, respectively; the extreme value proportions of TP load were 11.8% to 24.0%, 5.9% to 14.4%, and 2.8% to 9.8%, respectively. As the precipitation increases, the proportions of the three types of extreme values increase, and vice versa. The greater the absolute change value of the precipitation, the larger the proportion change of the extreme value.
