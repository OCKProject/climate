<p class="p">As for the future climate prediction scenario model, the prediction results showed that the annual precipitation presented an increasing trend in the LRB from 2020 to 2050, with significant alternation of wet and dry. The precipitation changes were basically the same in the RCP2.6 and RCP4.5. Significant increase presented in the downstream plain area (more than 10% in both RCP2.6 and RCP4.5) and in the upper reaches (more than 10% in RCP2.6 and more than 5% in RCP4.5), while in the RCP8.5, the areas with large precipitation increases were located in the source of the river, and the upper and middle reaches (more than 10%). The mean annual temperature will keep increasing in the LRB. The annual temperature change was in accordance with the historical period, while the monthly temperature had remarkable increases in late spring, early autumn and winter. The average annual temperature would increase above 1.75 Â°C in 2050 compared with the reference period in the whole LRB, with much more rapid increase in the upper plateau and the lower plain. However, the average annual temperature in the RCP8.5 was significantly higher than that in RCP2.6 and RCP4.5.</p>
