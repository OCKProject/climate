The proportion of extreme values in RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 was slightly lower than that in the reference period. The variations of extreme proportion presented a non-unified law. The proportion of extreme values based on three benchmarks—annual mean, three-times annual mean and five-times annual mean—presented in the following orders: RCP4.5 &gt; RCP2.6 &gt; RCP8.5, RCP8.5 &gt; RCP4.5 &gt; RCP2.6, and RCP2.6 &gt; RCP8.5 &gt; RCP4.5, respectively.
