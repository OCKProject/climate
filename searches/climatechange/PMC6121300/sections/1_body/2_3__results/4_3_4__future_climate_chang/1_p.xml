<p class="p">The monthly load of TN and TP simulated by RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 varied differently in the future period. However, the variation trends of TN and TP were roughly the same in each scenario model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-01724-f009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref>). From the perspective of monthly mean, the TN and TP load in three future climate scenario models generally showed decreasing trends from March to August and increasing trends from September to February. The monthly load in RCP2.6 was relatively higher in August. The monthly load in RCP4.5 was significantly higher in late spring, early summer (June), autumn and winter. The monthly load in RCP8.5 was more remarkable in summer, while for annual mean, the TN and TP load was slightly lower than that in the reference period. The load increased according to the following order: RCP 2.6 &lt; RCP 4.5 &lt; RCP 8.5.
