 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t010" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 10</xref> presents the incidence of TN and TP pollution under the Future Climate Change scenario. The incidence of TN pollution increased in three different RCPs, with increasing order of reference period &lt; RCP8.5 &lt; RCP2.6 &lt; RCP4.5. The incidence of TN pollution augmented about 6% to 8% in three RCPs compared with the reference period. Meanwhile, the incidence of TP pollution decreased. In RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, there is no pollution possibility in the future. Obviously, the TN pollution is more serious than TP pollution.
