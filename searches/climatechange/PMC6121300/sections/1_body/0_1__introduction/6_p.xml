<p class="p">In the past 50 years, both the annual precipitation and natural runoff in the Luanhe River Basin (LRB) had a decreasing trend. However, the demand for water resources has been increasing with the socioeconomic development. Therefore, the drought situation in the river basin has become increasingly severe, and also the water quality and hydrology conditions continue to deteriorate. According to the statistical analysis of water quality in the recent 10 years, the polluted rivers (Class IV and below) accounted for 43.2% of all evaluated rivers [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The monitoring results showed that the main pollution indicators of surface water in the LRB were ammonia nitrogen, total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The dissolved oxygen (DO) and ammonia nitrogen in the upper reaches of the Luanhe River changed obviously; the comprehensive pollution index of water quality in the midstream fluctuated basically between 0.2 and 0.4, and presented a downward trend in the downstream [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. As nitrogen and phosphorus are the main pollutants contributing to the deterioration of water quality in the Luanhe River, they were chosen as influence factors of water quality for analysis.
