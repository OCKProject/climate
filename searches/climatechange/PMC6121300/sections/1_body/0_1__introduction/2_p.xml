 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]; especially the LUCC (land use and land cover change), which is the main factor affecting non-point-source pollution [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Also, the change of climatic conditions in the future may lead to some uncertainties in water environment quality improvement, risk prevention and control effectiveness. In particular, under climate change, the intensity and frequency of extreme climate events such as heavy rainfalls, floods and droughts will increase, which increases the possibility of pollution incidents, and also augments the difficulty of water-environment risk prevention [

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Hence, climate change and LUCC are the key driving forces for surface water quality evolution.
