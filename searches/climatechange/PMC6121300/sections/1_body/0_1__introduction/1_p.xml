<p class="p">With the economic development and population increase, the global shortage of water resources is grim [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] and water pollution is also exacerbated [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]; surface freshwater pollution has become a major public hazard [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. At present, 40% of the rivers in the world have been polluted to varying degrees, and this statistic shows an upward trend [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Most basins in China have also been polluted to different degrees, and the water environment quality has been deteriorating day by day [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. The water pollution presents an increasing trend with extension from tributaries to mainstream, diffusion from region to basin, penetration from surface to underground, and spreading from urban to rural areas [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. According to the “2016 State of the Environment”, among the 1940 assessment sections of surface water, water quality in Class I, II, III, IV, V and inferior V accounted for 2.4%, 37.5%, 27.9%, 16.8%, 6.9% and 8.6%, respectively [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The detailed information about water quality parameters in different levels can be found in “Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water’’ [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The surface water quality has been improved compared with the previous years, however, the water pollution in the Haihe River Basin (including the Luanhe River) is more serious. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the surface water quality of the Luan River.
