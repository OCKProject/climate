<p class="p">The main objectives of our study were to: (i) analyze the load change of TN and TP flowing into the Luanhe River under the influence of temperature and precipitation change; (ii) predict the pollution incidence of TN and TP under future climate change; and (iii) investigate the evolution characteristics of TN and TP under land use change along the Luanhe River. Under four different scenario simulations (3 of climate change, 1 of LUCC), the evolution characteristics of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) load were investigated, which were based on the calibration and validation of hydrological process and water quality of the SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) model. To explore the evolution characteristics in each scenario, the main evaluation index contains four parts: TN and TP load, extreme values of TN and TP load, sensibility of TN and TP load, incidence of TN and TP pollution (

The broad implication of the present research is to better understand the historical evolution characteristics of surface water quality under climate change and LUCC, and also to predict the future evolution trends. The impact analysis of surface water quality under climate change can guide the adaptation strategies to the changed environment. The evolution mechanism of surface water quality under LUCC would provide references for the future planning of agricultural development, soil and water conservation, and so on.
