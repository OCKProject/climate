<p class="p">The impact of climate change on the natural environment, living creatures and others cannot be underestimated [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. There are relatively much more research results of the climate change impact on the amount of water resources, but the response of water quality to climate change needs to be further studied [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The drastic changes of temperature and precipitation will result in water pollution [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], which directly or indirectly affects the water quality in the basin. Water temperature changes will affect the water density, surface tension, viscosity and other aspects, and dissolved oxygen content will also change, thus breaking the normal aquatic ecological balance [

 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Temperature change will also affect the photosynthesis, the chemical reaction rate, the toxicity changes of various pollutants, and the microbial degradation ability of aquatic organisms [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Precipitation change will affect the occurrence of droughts and floods, and also will exert a subtle influence on the basin water quality. Precipitation decrease will prompt the exploitation of groundwater, then cause groundwater pollution; precipitation increase will aggravate atmospheric deposition and surface erosion, thus more pollutants will be brought into water [
