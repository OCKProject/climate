<p class="p">In the Precipitation Change scenario, the TN and TP loads (water pollution extreme events) were significantly proportional to the precipitation change. When the precipitation increased (decreased) by 10%, the load increased (decreased) by 23% to 30%, and the occurrence probability of extreme events increased (decreased) by 3% to 4%. The reasonable explanation is that when the precipitation increases, the basin runoff increases and the pollutant degradation coefficient of the water body increases [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], thus the pollution into the river decreases. There is no obvious variation trend of TN and TP pollution under different Precipitation Change scenarios. Maybe the incidence of TN and TP pollution is not sensitive to the precipitation change.
