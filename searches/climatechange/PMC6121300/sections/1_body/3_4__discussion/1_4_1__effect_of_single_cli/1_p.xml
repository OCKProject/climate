<p class="p">In the Temperature Change scenario, the TN and TP loads (water pollution extreme events) were basically inversely proportional to the temperature change (excluding winter). When the temperature increased (decreased) 1 Â°C, the load decreased (increased) by 12% to 19%, and the occurrence probability of extreme events decreased (increased) by 1% to 2%. The trend can be interpreted as follows. When the temperature increases, the evaporation increases, the basin runoff decreases and the pollutant degradation coefficient of the water body increases [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], thus the pollution into the river decreases. In addition, the load of TN and TP in the LRB was remarkably high from June to September but lower in winter. This trend is the combined effects of growing season, leaf litter, water temperature and other contributing factors. In summer, the synthesis rate of water pollutants is greater than the decomposition rate; the scouring effect is obvious with large runoff. In winter, farming areas reduce as the runoff and the temperature are relatively low. The incidence of TN pollution shows a positive correlation with temperature change, while there is no obvious correlation between temperature change and variation of incidence of TP pollution. It can be inferred that the TN production speed is faster than its composition speed when temperature increases, while no remarkable rule is found with TP.
