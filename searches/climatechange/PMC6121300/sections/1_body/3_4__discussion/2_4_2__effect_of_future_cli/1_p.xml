<p class="p">According to the IPCC report, the global average surface temperature in the mid-21st century will change by 1 to 2 Â°C compared with the historical period from 1986 to 2005, thus the simulation results of the Future Climate Change scenario were reasonable. Much research has been done on water quantity changes in the future [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], this study further analyzed the water quality. The simulation results of the LRB show that from 2020 to 2050, the annual mean of TN and TP load presented a trend of RCP2.6 &lt; RCP4.5 &lt; RCP8.5 &lt; reference period, and the occurrence probability of extreme water pollution events showed a trend of RCP4.5 &gt; reference period &gt; RCP2.6 &gt; RCP8.5. The precipitation-increasing patterns in the three scenarios were similar, but the temperature increased more in spring and summer. As the pollutant decomposition accelerated with temperature rising, the TN and TP load in spring and summer was lower than that in the reference period. The large base load in summer has a significant impact on the mean load, that is why the average annual loads in the three future climate scenario models were slightly lower than that in the reference period. It can be learned that the future temperature-increasing effect is more obvious than the future precipitation-increasing effect on the TN and TP load decreasing. The incidence of TN pollution will increase under all three RCPs, while the incidence of TP pollution will decrease. It can be concluded that the TN load is more sensitive to the future climate change than the TP load.
