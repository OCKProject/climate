<p class="p">Compared with land use of 1985, under the land use in 2000 and 2014, the natural land use decreased by 2.88% and 2.46%, respectively; the human activities land use increased by 1.59% and 2.07%, respectively; and the undeveloped land use increased by 1.29% and 0.38%, respectively. The analysis results in the LUCC scenario demonstrate that the TN and TP load increased correspondingly with the decrease of natural land use, the increase of human activities land use and undeveloped land use. The impact of different types of land use on water quality in the LRB shows generally the same trend with other basins [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-01724" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The effect of natural land use decrease on TN and TP load increase was significantly obvious. The more intense human activities, the more damage to natural land, thus the occurrence possibility of water pollution extreme events becomes greater. The data show that the underlying surface change has a significant impact on TN and TP load, as well as the incidence of TN and TP pollution.
