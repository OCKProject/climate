<p class="p">Based on the output results in SWAT, the average monthly load and average annual load of TN and TP under different scenarios were analyzed. To better understand the monthly variation trends of TN and TP load, the extreme values were further screened. The annual mean, three-times annual mean and five-times annual mean of TN and TP load from 1963 to 2017 were chosen as three benchmarks. The percentages above (including equal to) the three benchmarks in different scenarios were calculated. Meanwhile, the sensibility of the water quality index in different scenarios was considered.</p>
