<p class="p">This study used the SWAT model to simulate the TN and TP load in the basin. The input data of the SWAT model contains six major types, that is, topography, soil, land use, meteorology, hydrology and surface water quality (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01724-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Future meteorological data is based on the simulation results of the future climate prediction scenario model. The surface water quality data from 2015 to 2017 was based on monthly measurements in the downstream water quality monitoring site (Luanxian Station). The samples were analyzed on the basis of the Environmental Quality Standards for Surface Water (GB3838-2002) [
