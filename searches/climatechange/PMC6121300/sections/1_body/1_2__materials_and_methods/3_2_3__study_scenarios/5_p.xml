<p class="p">LUCC scenario. The evolution differences of TN and TP in the basin with the land use datasets of 1985, 2000 and 2014 were compared to reveal the impact of the underlying surface change. Various types of land use were broadly divided into three categories, that is, natural land use, human activities land use and undeveloped land use. The proportion changes of each category in 1985, 2000 and 2014 were identified (

This analysis applied different land use datasets, while the other factors that can influence TN and TP loads, such as WWTP (wastewater treatment plants) efficiencies, “good practice” in agriculture, and so on, were kept unchanged.
