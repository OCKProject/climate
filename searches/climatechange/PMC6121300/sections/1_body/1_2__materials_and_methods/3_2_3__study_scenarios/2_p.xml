<p class="p">Temperature Change scenario. The variation laws of TN and TP in the basin under single temperature change were investigated on the basis of the historical meteorological data from 1963 to 2017. The single temperature change means that the temperature was set increasing/decreasing by 1 °C and 2 °C, and the other meteorological factors were kept unchanged. The land use datasets of 1985, 2000 and 2014 were used to verify the universality of the variation laws.</p>
