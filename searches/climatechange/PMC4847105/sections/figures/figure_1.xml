  <p class="p">The relationship between risks from climate change, temperature increase and carbon dioxide emissions, and changes in annual greenhouse gas emissions. Reproduced from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report [
   <xref rid="B18-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) shows the level of additional risk due to climate change for five different threats. The risk per threat is scaled from “Very high” to “Undetectable” (see color legend below (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>)) for each increase in global mean temperature; (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) shows the relationship between cumulative greenhouse gas emissions (in GtCO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and changes in global mean temperature. The ellipses represent CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions under the different IPCC scenario categories; (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) links cumulative CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions to changes in annual greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
