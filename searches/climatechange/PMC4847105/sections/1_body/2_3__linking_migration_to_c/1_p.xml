<p class="p">As we have seen, the link between climate and migration is difficult to isolate. We must turn a similarly critical eye to the second pathwayâ€”the potential for migration to increase the risk of conflict. Current literature surrounding migration and conflict increasingly suggests that climate change and climate-related migration will not

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. While it is agreed that climate change will not alone cause conflict, it is also acknowledged almost universally that it has the potential to exacerbate or catalyze conflict in conjunction with other factors. However, how important a factor migration may be in terms of causing conflict is open to debate [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. This section will discuss first the evidence that links climate-migration to increased risk of conflict, and second the counter arguments that suggest that this pathway oversimplifies the relationship between climate-migration and conflict.
