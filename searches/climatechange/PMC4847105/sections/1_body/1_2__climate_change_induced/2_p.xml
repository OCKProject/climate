<p class="p">Because climate change is by definition a long-term process, and due to the uncertain attribution of extreme events to climate change, we lack the data and tools to directly document impacts of climate change per se on migration. Instead, most work in this area examines impacts of shorter-term climate variability (
 <italic class="italic">i.e.</italic>, extremes) to inform our understanding of how longer-term climate change may impact population health (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>., flooding as a proxy for sea-level rise). This assumption is implicit in most climate change and migration literature. It has been argued that if we wait for climate-change induced impacts to be clearly evident, it may be far too late to take action to prevent them [
