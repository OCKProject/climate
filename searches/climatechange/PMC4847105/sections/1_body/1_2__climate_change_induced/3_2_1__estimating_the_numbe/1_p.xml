<p class="p">Migration includes both short-term and long-term movements [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Published estimates of the numbers of people who may be displaced by climate change related phenomena by 2050 range from 50 million to 1 billion people [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Jacobson put forward the low end of the range (50 million environmental refugees) as an estimate of populations “at-risk” of a 1 m sea level rise [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. The most commonly cited number, 200 million, is based on projections conducted by Norman Myers in 1995 and 2000 [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This projection has not been rigorously tested, but is generally agreed upon as consistent with conservative estimates of climate impacts [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, Myers himself has admitted to uncertainty in his estimate and that necessary extrapolations were made due to a lack of available data [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The high-end estimate, 1 billion people displaced by 2050, comes from a Christian Aid report [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. This report breaks the estimate into 250 million people displaced by climate change related events, 50 million people displaced by natural disasters, 50 million people displaced by conflict, 5 million people fleeing their countries and being accepted as refugees, and the majority, 645 million people displaced by development projects [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Use of this number by the media and in academic literature is sometimes considered alarmist [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The large range in these estimates illustrates the enormous uncertainty surrounding the causal impacts of climate change on migration.
