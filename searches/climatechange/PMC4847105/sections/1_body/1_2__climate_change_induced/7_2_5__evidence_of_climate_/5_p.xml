<p class="p">Most of the literature to-date on climate and migration has focused on droughts and flooding. Much less research has examined the influence of temperature or fire extremes as migration drivers. In rural Pakistan, heat stress is associated with greater increases in long-term migration than flooding [

 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Forest fires have also been linked to an increased intention to migrate [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Most migration after fires is temporary, much like migration after other natural disasters; however, unlike after floods and droughts, researchers have found no difference in intention to migrate between socioeconomic groups after fires [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Despite these intriguing results, there is little to no available research on the specific mechanisms by which these extremes might impact migration in the context of climate change.
