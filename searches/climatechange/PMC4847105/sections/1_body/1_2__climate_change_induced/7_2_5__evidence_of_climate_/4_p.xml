<p class="p">Flooding, often caused by extreme storm events, of a driver migration. Mallick and Vogt found that migration rates were much higher in lower socioeconomic segments of Bangladeshi society after Cyclone Aila [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This was largely due to a need to diversify income and the inability to rebuild lost or damaged property [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. This mirrors findings in drought literature that income can be a determining factor in migration during or after periods of environmental stress. However, a review of migration in response to natural disasters that occurred in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s found that flood events were not associated with increases in out-migration [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. This may be due in part to public efforts at disaster mitigation, including rebuilding after storms and increasing protection in flood-prone areas [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. This suggests that perhaps governmental support has the capacity to outweigh other factors that might influence migration. Similarly, overall migration was relatively limited after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. This suggests very low levels of long-term migration, due in part to government and donor support for rebuilding [
