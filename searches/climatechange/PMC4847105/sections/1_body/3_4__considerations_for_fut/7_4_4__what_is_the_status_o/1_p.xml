<p class="p">Gleditsch stressed the importance of creating better indicators to measure the role of political institutions in conflict research almost 20 years ago [
 <xref rid="B85-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. However, there are limited studies that successfully incorporate these stabilizing forces. One notable exception is Hummelâ€™s (2015) thorough review of climate change and migration in Mali and Senegal, which placed particular emphasis on political and legal frameworks that influence migration [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Hummel found that in the West African Sahel, while environmental stressors can influence mobility, the environment is not usually the most important factor that causes people to migrate [
 <xref rid="B86-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Additionally, Hummel suggests that because of the cultural history of migration of the people of West Africa, political strategies should not attempt to limit migration, but instead should try to harness it as a tool for adaptation. This demonstrates the capacity of political institutions to facilitate adaption and reduce vulnerability. This can also be done through the development of infrastructure to help populations withstand extreme events [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. Physical infrastructure, such as irrigation systems, well-maintained buildings and roads, as well as healthcare infrastructure can greatly reduce susceptibility [
 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. In contrast, vulnerability is increased in regions with political insecurity and in those that lack adequate infrastructure and services provided by the government [
