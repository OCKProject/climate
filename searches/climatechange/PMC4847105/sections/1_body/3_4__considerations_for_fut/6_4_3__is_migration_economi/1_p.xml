<p class="p">Economic development can both contribute to and limit migration. In poorer regions, migration can be used to diversify income, and may be a necessary strategy for survival after extreme events. Alternatively, severe poverty, which is associated with limited resources, may limit capacity for migration [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Income, which is often used as a proxy for poverty, has been found to have different impacts on migration choice after natural disasters: some research has found an inverted U-shaped pattern where the middle incomes migrate more frequently and the low and high incomes more often stay [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. However, others have not been able to replicate this migration pattern [
 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Again, this factor cannot be isolated from its lateral counterparts. As Massey reminds us, the source of income is of particular importance [
