<p class="p">Climate change will restrict resource availability in many areas of the world [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. In some regions, stabilizing factors such as governments with adaption plans or economic safety nets will be able to reduce the potential for conflict. However, in certain areas, resource scarcity may be too severe to overcome without negative consequences. The Middle East and North Africa, described as the most “water-scarce region of the world”, have seen significant increases in droughts over the last two decades [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In this area, decreased water availability has significant consequences as some Arab countries are dropping below levels of absolute scarcity per capita [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. In these contexts, it is possible that increased water scarcity is more likely to cause conflict than in moister regions. Furthermore, it is important to note that resource scarcity is not isolated from political stability. Regions that have historically been dealing with issues of resource scarcity may have weaker or less developed governments and institutions [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-13-00443" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Thus, regions already experiencing resource scarcity may be doubly vulnerable to conflict as a result of climate-migration because of a pre-existing lack of resources, but also because of a potential lack of mediating forces such as political stability.
