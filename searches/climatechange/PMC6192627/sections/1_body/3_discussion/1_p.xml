<p class="p">This study analyzed data from 1981 to 2015 to assess the global impacts of climate change. However, comparison of two decades (1981–1990 versus 2006–2015) may be affected by specific factors influencing wheat production. In North America, the 1980s witnessed below long-term precipitation, while 2010–2015 had above average precipitation. Precipitation increases in the 2000s may therefore indicate cyclical change rather than long-term climate change. In Eurasia, wheat production and agriculture underwent the introduction of intensive technologies in the 1980s. The collapse of the Soviet Union and economic crisis that followed greatly affected farming, which experienced a sharp decline and did not recover until the mid-2000s. Other drivers such as wheat prices, biotic and abiotic challenges, government policies, etc. may have also affected wheat production. However, comparing these two decades is still relevant as it considers two different climate scenarios. It is also reinforced by the regression analysis of 35 years of data for key weather and agronomic parameters.</p>
