<p class="p">Two regions of spring wheat cultivation evaluated in this study represent very distinct environments, even though both are high latitude with a continental climate. Eurasian spring wheat zone is situated 5° (more than 500 km) further north than the North American region. It is subject to a more continental climate with colder winters, hotter summers, and less precipitation. The Tmin change occurring since 1981 during the wheat cycle (April-August), increasing by 0.25°C in Eurasia and 0.22°C in North America was not significant.</p>
