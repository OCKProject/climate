<p class="p">One important difference between North America and Eurasia was air temperature during the growing season. Daily Tmax values represent the highest daytime temperature, which defines the rate of plant growth and development. High Tmax values negatively affects the wheat crop. Daily values of Tmin represent night temperature and are an important indicator of wheat adaptation and grain yield. In Mexico’s Yaqui Valley, historical yields are strongly correlated with Tmin but not Tmax [

Trends in recent temperature observations are characterized by greater warming of daily minimum relative to maximum temperatures. The Eurasian breeding sites demonstrated Tmin during April-August at least 1.6°C higher compared to North America, while Tmax was similar in both regions. In this study, the effect of Tmax on grain yield at the breeding sites was much more pronounced than Tmin. However, higher values of Tmin in Eurasia may be one additional factor limiting yield, along with low yearly and seasonal precipitation.
