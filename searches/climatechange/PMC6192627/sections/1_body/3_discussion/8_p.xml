<p class="p">On a global scale, the North American and Eurasian spring wheat production regions are complementary for stable grain production and food security. Higher yields in one region were normally associated with lower yields in the other. The whole high latitude continental climate spring wheat area certainly represents huge potential for global wheat production. Grise and Kulshreshtha [

Unfortunately, their model did not project additional northern land coming into production as the climate improves for annual crops. In North America, the pace of production gain can be easily sustained, driven by increasing wheat grain demand, especially from wheat importing regions. In Eurasia, yields are so low that they could potentially be doubled or tripled by using modern varieties, technologies, and economic incentives. Spring wheat research and breeding programs in the two regions will benefit tremendously from germplasm exchange and cooperation with emphasis on the climate change challenges and opportunities presented in this paper.
