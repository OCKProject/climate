<p class="p">This study was based on data from breeding trials conducted over 35 years, without considering the genetic gains achieved during this period. Several studies have addressed the issue of genetic gains using historical sets of Canadian Western Red Spring Wheat cultivars [

 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The breeding progress in these experiments varied from 0.7 to 1.3% per year and was comparable between the programs. However, there is an important difference in the adaptation pattern of spring wheat varieties from North America and Siberia. Trethowan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] compared the performance of high latitude Canadian, North American, Kazakh, Siberian, Chinese, and Mexican germplasm through a multi-locational trial in these countries. North American germplasm evolved more towards shorter plant stature and day-length insensitivity, compared to Kazakh and Siberian varieties. However, yields of the Kazakh and Siberian germplasm were relatively high, not only in Siberia but also competitive with the Canadian varieties in Canada. The tall stature and day length sensitivity of Siberian germplasm clearly played an important role in adaptating the germplasm to local conditions.
