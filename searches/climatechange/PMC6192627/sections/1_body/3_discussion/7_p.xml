<p class="p">The climatic changes since 1981 and spring wheat responses to variation in air temperature and precipitation suggest several implications for breeding. Gradual warming extends the wheat growing season and new varieties need to match this to utilize their environmental potential. Higher rainfall during the wheat season, especially in North America, will require varieties with higher yield potential responding to moisture availability. June is a critical month for spring wheat in both regions due to the significant negative correlation of grain yield with Tmax and positive correlation with precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. June coincides with stem elongation, booting stage, and heading, therefore, heat shock, especially in June and early July can have a detrimental effect on grain yield [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Heat shock can also inhibit pollen growth, cause sterility and grain abortion, trigger premature senescence, inhibit kernel development, and cause significant grain yield reductions [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Breeding for adaptation to higher temperatures during this period is an important strategy to increase yield. Though the effect of Tmin on grain yield is less pronounced compared to Tmax, the study of its effect on spring wheat yield is well justified. Due to overall low precipitation in Eurasia drought tolerance breeding remains an important objective for the breeding programs.
