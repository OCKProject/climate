<p class="p">In Eurasia, the wheat cycle Tmax increased by 0.54°C while seasonal and yearly precipitation were essentially unchanged. Planting and harvesting dates both shifted later by 2–3 days, leaving crop cycle duration largely unchanged. However, there are significant regional variations in this respect. At individual research and breeding sites, spring wheat seasons with longer duration and later harvesting dates resulted in higher grain yields. Generally, crop productivity was negatively associated with Tmax in June, July, and April-August, and positively with rainfall in June.</p>
