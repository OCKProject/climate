Global wheat area was estimated to be 225 million ha and can be classified into several environments depending on the growth habit, temperature, and moisture availability: spring wheat irrigated/high rainfall, hot and humid; winter wheat irrigated/high rainfall, semi-arid and low rainfall winter and spring wheat [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Low rainfall spring wheat is largely produced in high latitude regions of Canada, USA, Kazakhstan, and Russia (above 45° north) with a continental climate. It is a short season crop, growing for approximately 100 days from May to September. Yields are relatively low (1.5–3.0 t/ha) due to the limited growing season, moisture availability, and the impact of abiotic and biotic stresses. Nevertheless, this production environment plays an important role in global food security and wheat prices since most of the grain is traded. The World Wheat Book provides detailed description of spring wheat production and breeding systems in Canada [

 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Spring wheat production systems of North America and Eurasia are defined by their ecology, climate, technologies, crop varieties, and marketing systems. The hard red spring wheat region in Canada and the USA is situated at slightly lower latitudes than the Eurasian regions of western Siberia and northern Kazakhstan. The North American region is also slightly warmer and receives higher precipitation. Spring wheat varieties in Canada are developed, grown, and traded in eight market classes [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. These market classes are segregated based on gluten strength, protein content, kernel hardness, and seed color to fit end-user specifications, domestically and internationally. The market classes for spring wheat in Eurasia are very similar to North America and utilize the same criteria. However, production is mainly limited to hard red spring bread wheat. An important difference in the two production systems is a much wider application of zero tillage and conservation agriculture in North America compared to Eurasia. During 1975–2007, the share of wheat in the crop rotation declined while the share of legumes and oil crops increased substantially, and summer fallow acres declined in North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Zero tillage is gaining popularity in Eurasia where on-farm trials have revealed that it can be a successful dryland cropping method under climate change [
