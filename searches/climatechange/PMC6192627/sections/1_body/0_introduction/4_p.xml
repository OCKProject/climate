<p class="p">Weather data and agronomic performance of experimental lines and a check variety Thatcher were compiled for six sites in Montana for 1950 to 2007 [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Mean annual and March temperature increased significantly at all sites. The planting date has become significantly earlier at a rate of 0.24 d/year. July temperatures increased significantly at two sites and showed negative correlation with grain yield at three sites. Earlier planting due to warmer springs has helped to alleviate negative effects of high temperatures during grain filling period.
