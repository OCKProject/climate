<p class="p">Long-term wheat trials have been successfully utilized to evaluate the effect of weather and climate on adaptation, yield, and related traits. The analysis of spring wheat trials from 1981 till 2002 in Alberta province, Canada, demonstrated that genotype x environment patterns were inconsistent because of complex, highly variable and unpredictable year x location effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. High-yielding and stable varieties were repeatedly selected over years and were popular varieties grown by farmers. The effect of breeding on yield and other important traits of 100 wheat cultivars released in Canada from 1885 to 2012 was studied in seven environments during 2007â€“2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Grain yield was positively correlated with days to maturity and kernel weight but negatively with plant height, lodging, and grain protein content. Days to maturity increased for the Canada Western Red Spring (high protein concentration, strong gluten, high milling yield,) market class. Predominant varieties since about 1997 (AC Barrie, Carberry, and AAC Brandon) have become progressively later maturing than the original standards Neepawa and Katepwa. Increased time to maturity was combined with improved grain yield and shifted the negatively related protein concentration. Variety AC Barrie yields 4.5% more grain combined with 0.4 units more protein, while only being 2.3 days later than Katepwa [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Carberry yielded 14% more grain, had 0.3 units more protein concentration, and was 3.5 days later than Katepwa [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. AAC Brandon yielded 12% more at equal protein concentration while being 3.6 days later than Katepwa [
