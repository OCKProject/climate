 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204932.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) that represent the diversity of high latitude spring wheat production environments in North America and Eurasia. For all 19 sites, three important weather parameters–monthly average daily minimum temperature (Tmin), monthly average daily maximum temperature (Tmax), and average monthly precipitation–were extracted from the CRU TS3.1 dataset (

Weather data used in the study are not the actual physical data but approximations based on recordings from nearby weather stations. Evidence of climate change was evaluated for each site by comparing the mean weather parameters values for 1981–1990 versus 2006–2015, and by calculating coefficients of determination (r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of Tmin and Tmax on years during 1981–2015. We assumed that significance of r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> indicated significance of weather change over time and thus, evidence for changing climate. The direction of the change was estimated by calculating the regression slope. A similar approach was previously used by Morgounov et al. [
