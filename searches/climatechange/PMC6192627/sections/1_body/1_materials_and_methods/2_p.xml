<p class="p">Spring wheat is normally grown from May until September in Eurasia and from mid-April to late August in North America. Several critical phases of development define a cropâ€™s success or failure: a) crop establishment after planting, which requires moisture and warm temperature (May); b) tillering, stem elongation, and booting (June); c) heading-anthesis (mid-July); and d) grain filling-maturity (July-August). This study focused on weather conditions during these critical phases.</p>
