 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204932.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>. Tmin tended to increase over the 35 year period analyzed. Significant changes took place in Lethbridge (cooling), St. Paul (warming), and Samara (warming) (
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Tmin increased significantly in St. Paul for the months of June, July, and August, resulting in an increased growing season temperature (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204932.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>). Tmin also decreased significantly in Lethbridge during April, May, June, and August, but in Swift Current there was only significant Tmin change in July. For Tmax, significant warming during the whole wheat season was observed only in Samara (
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Tmax increased significantly in April in Barnaul, Astana, and Novosibirsk, while Tmax increased significantly in May at Kostanay and during the year in Astana (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204932.s004" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). Interestingly, the average Tmin for all North American and Eurasian sites for April-August increased by 0.22–0.25°C in 2006–2015 compared to 1981–1990 (
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). During the same period, average Tmax at North American sites reduced by 0.32°C, while it increased by 0.54°C across Eurasian sites.
