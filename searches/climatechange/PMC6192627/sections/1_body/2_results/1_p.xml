These regions are extremely important for food security because most of the wheat produced is then traded. In 2017, wheat yields in North America were 2–3 times higher than in Eurasia, despite record overall wheat production in Russia. There are several reasons for this difference including environment, overall economic situation, production technologies, and input applications, as well as climate change. 
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> compares average wheat yields from 1981–1990 and 2006–2015 for both on-station trials and the regional/provincial average. On-station yields in North America demonstrated good progress, increasing by 6.9–69.7% across sites. Farmers production yield in 2006–2015 compared to 1981–1990 demonstrated high yield gain across provinces and states varying from 31 to 65%. Significant yield gain in 35 years was also reflected by significant r

America indicating that farmers yield grew faster compared to stations. In Eurasia, by contrast, on-station yields increased by a maximum of 23% at individual sites, and even decreased at two sites. No significant yield gain in production fields was recorded with exception of Saratov. The yield gap in the recent time even widened compared to the 1980s. Overall, both on-farm and on-station historical yield performance in Eurasia was much poorer compared to N. America.
