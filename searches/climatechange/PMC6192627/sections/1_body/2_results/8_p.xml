<p class="p">For each site, coefficients of correlation were calculated between planting date, harvesting date, and planting-harvesting duration on one hand and grain yield on the other (
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). In general, for most sites, later harvesting date as well as increase in planting-harvesting duration was positively and significantly associated with grain yield. Similar results were obtained by Hua et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] for Western Canada. The exceptions were Glenlea, Langdon, Omsk, and Kostanay where no significant correlation with yield was observed. The effect of planting date on grain yield was much less pronounced; only at Brookings did years with later planting result in lower yields due to exposure to high temperatures at maturity. The positive effect of crop cycle duration on grain yield were further supported by plotting changes in planting-harvest period in 2006–2015 versus 1981–1990 against grain yield changes for the same time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0204932.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Sites where planting-harvesting period increased by 3–8 days in 2006–2015 compared to 1981–1990 demonstrated higher yield gains.
