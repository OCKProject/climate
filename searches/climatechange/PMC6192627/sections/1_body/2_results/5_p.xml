<p class="p">To evaluate dependence of spring wheat grain yield on temperature and precipitation, coefficients of correlations were calculated for the means of on-station grain yield and weather parameters in June, July, and April-August (
 <xref rid="pone.0204932.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The month of June demonstrated the highest correlation with yield for all three weather parameters. The most critical factor determining grain yield was Tmax in the month of June, with 12 of the 19 sites having significant negative correlation. The April-August period was the second most correlated for all three weather variables, followed by July. Increases in Tmin and Tmax negatively affected yield at two Manitoba sites, Selby (S. Dakota), Samara, Saratov, Kostanay, Astana, and Novosibirsk. Yields in Saskatoon, Swift Current, and Carrington reacted significantly negatively only to increases in Tmax. The yield at two sites in Minnesota, Langdon (N. Dakota), Brookings (S. Dakota), Barnaul and Omsk did not show any significant correlation with temperature or precipitation.
