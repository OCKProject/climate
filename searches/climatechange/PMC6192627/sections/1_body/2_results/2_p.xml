<p class="p">Year to year variation in farmersâ€™ yields in Canadian provinces and USA states were strongly correlated (coefficients of correlation &gt; 0.6) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0204932.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). High or low yields in one state or province were normally accompanied by high or low yields across North America. The lowest correlation was between the grain yield in Alberta on one hand and in Minnesota and North Dakota on the other hand, respectively 0.47 and 0.56. Yearly yield variation in North American sites did not correspond with most of Eurasian sites. This offers opportunity for stable grain production and mutual compensation when one continent has lower yield while the other produces more. Eurasian sites did not show high and consistent correlation among themselves with the exception of neighboring regions: Samara-Saratov, Kostanay-Astana; Omsk-Novosibirsk, Novosibirsk-Barnaul.
