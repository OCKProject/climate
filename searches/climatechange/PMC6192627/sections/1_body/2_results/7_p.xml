<p class="p">Vegetative period duration plays a very important role for a short-season crop like spring wheat. Climate change and yearly weather variations certainly affected the planting and harvesting times throughout the 35 years of this study. All breeding sites in Canada, classify maturity as physiological maturity which occurs when 50% of the spikes have kernels at approximately 30% moisture on a wet weight basis. Actual date of harvest is a function of the passive dry-down weather conditions. Only one location (Samara) demonstrated substantial reduction in planting to harvesting duration from 1981–1990 (102.8 days) to 2006–2015 (93.3 days) (

At Swift Current, Barnaul, and Omsk planting moved to earlier dates and harvesting to later dates. He et al. [

At Langdon, Carrington, and Crookston the planting date did not change but harvesting took place 4–7 days later. At Novosibirsk, Glenlea, Saratov, and St. Paul both planting and harvesting changed by 5–10 days later without change in the duration of growing period. Two locations (Astana and Brandon) demonstrated no change.
