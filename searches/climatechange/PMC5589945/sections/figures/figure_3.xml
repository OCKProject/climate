Letters represent field sites Beaufort West (B), Cradock (C), Nieu Bethesda (N), Gariep Dam (G). Proximal represents the entire foredeep in this diagram and distal is the back bulge. The Cape Fold Belt (CFB) represents the source of sediment and tectonic activity south of the basin. Numbered 1â€“4, the basin schematics depict changes in orogenic loading and unloading and the effect this had creation of accommodation in the Karoo foreland basin.
