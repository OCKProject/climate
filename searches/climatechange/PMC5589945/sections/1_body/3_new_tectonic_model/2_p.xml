<p id="Par9" class="p">It is interesting to note that although out-of-phase, the western and eastern basin (Teekloof and Balfour formations) show similar lithostratigraphic sequences and it is clear they were influenced by similar tectonic and climatic events in the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The western and eastern sectors of the Karoo Basin could represent two distinct Distributive Fluvial Systems (DFS)

 </sup>, which is interpreted as a palaeotopographic high, was present between these two parts of the basin. This may explain some differences between the two parts of the basin but essentially, they are reflecting similar tectonic events in the foreland system defined by fairly repetitive, and roughly synchronous, depositional cycles

 </sup>. This also entertains the possibility of alternative controls on subsidence that caused the basin to contain down-warped depressions and upward arches formed by the interplay of the foreland compressional tectonics and local rheology and structural integrity of the basement rocks. The Kaapvaal Craton situated below the distal basin would have been more rigid and buoyant than the Namaqua-Natal Metamorphic Belt which comprises the basement rocks of the proximal foredeep and back bulge. Structural anomalies could have controlled tectonics locally

 </sup>, and may have contributed to the out-of-phase deposition created by flexural tectonics of the foreland system. This study’s basin model has four stages which explain the inferred tectonic setting of the Late Permian Karoo Basin (Fig.
