<p id="Par12" class="p">Stage 3 is an unloading phase resulting in distal progradation of sediment when accommodation became available in the distal foredeep. This explains the attenuated but similar stratigraphy. The third-order sequence began to fine upwards, terminating in the argillaceous Elandsberg and Palingkloof members (FigsÂ
