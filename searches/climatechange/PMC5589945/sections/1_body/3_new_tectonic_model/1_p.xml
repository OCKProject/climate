<p id="Par8" class="p">All evidence collected indicates that cyclic, out-of-phase sedimentation in the Karoo Basin during the Late Permian resulted from a strong tectonic influence south of the basin which was also the source of clastic material. Our depositional model refines third-order detail in addition to the mostly first and second-order framework of the Karoo Basin sedimentary fill
