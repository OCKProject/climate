<p id="Par10" class="p">Stage 1 Follows orogenic uplift in the Gondwanide Mobile Belt with the onset of sedimentation of the Balfour in the southeast and upper Teekloof formations in the southwest of the basin which began at the base of the first second-order SU and represents the beginning of a fining-upward cycle deposited by low sinuosity rivers (the eastern Oudeberg and western Oukloof members). Distally, there was non-deposition as no lithostratigraphic equivalent is documented close to the forebulge. Once sediment supply became less than available accommodation, the sequence began to fine-upward, depositing argillaceous material by high sinuosity rivers (the eastern Daggaboersnek and western Steenkampsvlakte members).</p>
