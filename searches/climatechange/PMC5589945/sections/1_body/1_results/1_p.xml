<p id="Par6" class="p">Composite sections of the four field sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and a suggested basin model for the Late Permian Karoo Basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) present the results. The composite sections document two fining-upward sequences in the Balfour and upper Teekloof formations. Our study also identifies three subaerial unconformities (SU) using the criteria outlined previously (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Two second-order SUs are present at the base and top of the Balfour Formation
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup> and one third-order SU is noted in the middle of the Balfour Formation, which only attains a maximum thickness of 513 m. This contradicts previous observations on the sequence stratigraphy of the Balfour Formation, whose six third-order SU over a 2150 m stratigraphic interval

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup> are based only on estimated Late Permian lithostratigraphic thicknesses

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>
 </sup>. Our study extends the second-order SU at the base of the Balfour Formation west to the base of the Oukloof Member (upper Teekloof Formation) and northwards towards the basin’s forebulge (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and

 </sup> show the SU are diachronous. 
 <italic class="italic">Daptocephalus</italic> Assemblage Zone tetrapod fauna provide further evidence for out-of-phase sedimentation because they occur in different lithostratigraphic units in different parts of the foreland system. From absolute dates which constrain their stratigraphic distribution in the eastern basin, the conclusion can be made that the SU boundaries are older in the western part of the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
