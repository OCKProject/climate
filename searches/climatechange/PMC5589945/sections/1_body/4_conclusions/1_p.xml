<p id="Par13" class="p">Flexural tectonics imposed phases of orogenic loading and unloading during the Late Permian Karoo Basin. This was the major control on the distribution of accommodation in the foredeep of the Karoo Basin as demonstrated by northward thinning wedge-shaped deposition of strata and cyclic sedimentation bounded by two second-order, and one third-order subaerial unconformities (SU)

 </sup>. Foreland tectonics meant that progradation of sediment northwards (distal foredeep) during orogenic loading and unloading was not in phase with the south (proximal foredeep) which resulted in an incomplete and attenuated stratigraphic record to the north, and diachronous SU between the west and eastern parts of the basin.
