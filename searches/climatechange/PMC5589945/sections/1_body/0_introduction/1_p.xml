Despite disagreements, most workers recognize foreland basin tectonics with a north dipping subduction zone in the Karoo basin and it is only the timing of the onset of foreland tectonics that has been seriously disputed. It is now clear that by the time of deposition of the Dwyka Group, foreland tectonics were already operating
