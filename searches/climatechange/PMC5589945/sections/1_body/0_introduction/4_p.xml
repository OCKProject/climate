 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This study reviews the tectonic setting of the Late Permian Karoo Basin and uses sequence stratigraphy to provide an updated basin development model. It also discusses the implications of our increased understanding of Late Permian Karoo Basin dynamics and how to recognize the climatic overprint on foreland basin sequences.
