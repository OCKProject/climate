 </sup>. Orogenic loading and unloading in the GMB changed the forebulge and foredeepâ€™s positions, and this resulted in deposition in the proximal basin in the south during loading and distal regions of the Karoo Basin in the north during unloading. Where a time lag occurred between orogenic loading and basinal subsidence

 </sup> the upper and lower boundaries of lithostratigraphic units are diachronous, and have proximal and distal equivalents. Thus, many of the upper and lower boundaries of lithostratigraphic groups are diachronous or have proximal and distal equivalents
