<p id="Par4" class="p">Modern and ancient foreland basins like the Karoo Basin are bounded by tectonically active source areas. Episodic tectonic activity results in the rejuvenation of fluvial systems leading to deposition of coarser sediment, and cessation in tectonic activity results in an overall fining upward sequence
