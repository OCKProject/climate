 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Numerous fossils were collected and stratigraphically recorded. Vertical sections measured compiled four composite sections, one for each field site. This was done to investigate Late Permian Karoo Basin litho, bio, and sequence stratigraphy. This research also required referral to research conducted by previous workers to corroborate findings
