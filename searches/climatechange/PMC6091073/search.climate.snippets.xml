  <result pre="varied geographies, developing countries in Southeast Asia have broadly similar" exact="climate" post="change-related vulnerabilities due to a high and growing population"/>
  <result pre="and a reliance on agriculture for livelihoods [ 1]. The" exact="Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" post="(IPCC) [ 2] defines vulnerability as a function of"/>

  <result pre="Southeast Asia. Public health and climate change The literature on" exact="climate" post="change and health is evolving rapidly. For example, Hess"/>

  <result pre="in Southeast Asia Despite evidence of ROs focussing attention on" exact="climate" post="change and health (see e.g. [ 10, 13]), literature"/>
  <result pre="argued that there is a need for clear evidence of" exact="climate" post="and health links, and also a need for evidence"/>
  <result pre="a need for evidence that responses will be cost-effective. Supporting" exact="IPCC" post="and WHO assessments, Wahlqvist et al. [ 28] argued"/>

  <result pre="55]. Another weakness is that the project aim of reducing" exact="climate" post="change vulnerabilities of poor and marginalised populations is not"/>
  <result pre="objective of improving the coping capacity of governments to health-related" exact="climate" post="change impacts. It is possible that some of these"/>
  <result pre="organisations also report positively on outputs relating more directly to" exact="climate" post="and health. For example, in 2016 the APRF reported"/>
  <result pre="had produced a NEHAP, with nine of the 12 including" exact="climate" post="change as an environmental health issue [ 66]. Similarly,"/>

  <result pre="a strong possibility that any funds sought would be for" exact="climate" post="change and health because of the increasing global prioritisation"/>
