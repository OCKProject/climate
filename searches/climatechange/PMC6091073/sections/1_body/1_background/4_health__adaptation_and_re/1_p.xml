<p id="Par13" class="p">Despite evidence of ROs focussing attention on climate change and health (see e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]), literature focussing on ROs, CCA and health is scarce. In one paper, Thomson et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] argued that there is a need for clear evidence of climate and health links, and also a need for evidence that responses will be cost-effective. Supporting IPCC and WHO assessments, Wahlqvist et al. [
