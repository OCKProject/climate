<p id="Par15" class="p">This research qualitatively assesses ROs supporting CCA and health, and is built on modern organisation theory, with the researcher also influenced by resilience thinking. Resilience thinking links closely to sustainability ideals. It acknowledges a dynamic external environment that requires individuals and systems to continuously and iteratively adapt [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Modern organisation theory recognises the importance of different scales working together, with individuals working within broader systems and processes. It also recognises the importance of decision-making and communication processes and how these link with organisational goals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Scott ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>], p. 16) argued that identifying the “mutual dependency” between principle parts of the organisation is a key to understanding organisational dynamics. Adding resilience thinking supports explicit recognition of factors external to the organisation, such as climate change-related health impacts and other organisations. It also means recognising that changes are occurring, and that uncertainty is not an excuse for inaction [see for example Hallegatte’s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] description of strategies to cope with uncertainties associated with climate change]. It further recognises that system changes are possible without losing organisational identity [see for example Jacque’s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] description of Japan’s response to forced engagement with the West in the 1800s]. Resilience thinking and modern organisation theory both complement the researcher’s view that sustainability will be enhanced when ROs, and their support for CCA and health, are regularly reviewed to reflect both environmental and institutional changes at global and national levels.
