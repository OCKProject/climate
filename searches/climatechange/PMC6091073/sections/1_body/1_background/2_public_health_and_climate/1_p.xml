<p id="Par11" class="p">The literature on climate change and health is evolving rapidly. For example, Hess et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] reviewed the work of authors including Ebi and Burton [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>], Ebi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], Ebi and Semenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>], Ebi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>], concluding that while there is substantial literature on identifying climate change impacts on public health, little focusses on public health interventions. To reconcile evidence-based public health (EBPH) with CCA and health, Hess et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] modified Jones et al
 <italic class="italic">’s</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] EBPH framework to incorporate CCA concerns. Likewise, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention developed the standalone ‘Building Resilience Against Climate Effects’ (BRACE) framework, which Marinucci et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] described as suitable for assessing climate-related impacts on health as well as for prioritising interventions. While these authors focussed on the climate-health interface, the research presented here focusses on how effectively ROs are supporting health related CCA.
