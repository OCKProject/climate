<p id="Par6" class="p">Southeast Asia comprises 11 countries, ranging from archipelagos and an island-state, to landlocked Laos. Despite their varied geographies, developing countries in Southeast Asia have broadly similar climate change-related vulnerabilities due to a high and growing population and a reliance on agriculture for livelihoods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>] defines vulnerability as a function of several elements, including physical impact exposure (e.g. changing rainfall patterns) and adaptive capacity (e.g. ability to adjust one’s means of livelihood support). For example, Yusuf and Francisco [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] rated Cambodia’s climate change vulnerability as high because, despite relative insulation from physical climate change impacts, the country’s poor infrastructure, widespread poverty and lack of technology means it has low adaptive capacity. Similarly, McElwee [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] described the high vulnerability levels of the many people of the Mekong Delta whose poverty and poor education limit their capacity to maintain livelihoods in the face of climate-related shocks including rising sea-level induced salt-water intrusion into agricultural areas. Broadly similar regional vulnerabilities highlight the importance of regional organisations (ROs) supporting climate change adaptation (CCA) in Southeast Asia. Regional organisations are supra-national institutions with national governments as members, established to address shared problems and focussing their activities in a specific region.
