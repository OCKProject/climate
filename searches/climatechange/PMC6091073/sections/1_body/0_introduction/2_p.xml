 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>], p. 1758). For health, this includes more than climate-proofing treatment centres and preparing for more cases of climate-sensitive diseases, because health determinants include factors both inside and outside the direct control of health ministries, including “access to safe water and clean air, food security, strong and accessible health systems, and reductions in social and economic inequity” ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], p. 2). Missoni [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] argued that inequality, including health inequality, is exacerbated by a focus on economic growth and, further, that addressing health determinants ahead of time is less expensive and leads to longer-term sustainability. Similarly, improving health determinant access will increase adaptive capacities, emphasising the growing importance of interactions between health and CCA [
