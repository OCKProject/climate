<p id="Par16" class="p">Conceptually, organisational effectiveness is about an organisationâ€™s systems, procedures and resources providing it with the capacity to achieve outputs and outcomes, as well as about its actual success in achieving those goals. For example Scott [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>] premised effectiveness on goal achievement as well as resource acquisition ability, internal processes and stakeholder satisfaction. Despite its conceptual simplicity, there is a lack of agreement on suitable organisational effectiveness measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Including CCA and public health in organisational goals increases the challenge because both are future-focussed. Robinson and Gilfillan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] reviewed the organisational effectiveness literature for CCA-related effectiveness indicators, developing the Framework for Assessing Regional Organisations Coordinating Climate Change Adaptation (FAROCCCA) because of a lack of suitable existing assessment frameworks. FAROCCCA, as used for this research, is a tool comprising 63 specific indicators of organisational effectiveness relevant to CCA and health. The 63 indicators were developed by Robinson and Gilfillan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] based on previous work on organisational effectiveness across a variety of disciplines and literatures, such as private and public sector effectiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>], resource management (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]), and modern organisational theory (e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]). FAROCCCA includes elements of four main models of organisational effectiveness: 1) the goal oriented model, which focusses on immediate organisational outputs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], 2) the resource-oriented model, which is premised on an organisational need to acquire resources in order to function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>], 3) the process-oriented model, which considers how effectively those resources are used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>], and 4) the strategic constituency model, which concerns itself with relationships and linkages between an organisation and its primary stakeholders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The evidence gathered against a single FAROCCCA indicator provides one data point, but using the framework to systematically compile and analyse evidence can provide useful insights into organisational operations.
