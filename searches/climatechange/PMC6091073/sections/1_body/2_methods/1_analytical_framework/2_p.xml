<p id="Par17" class="p">The 63 FAROCCCA indicators are split between 18 sub-components, ranging from goals and governance to initiative design logic and collaboration, as shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> in the results section. The sub-components are further split between the following three FAROCCCA components:

   <p id="Par18" class="p">The organisation’s inputs, which are the characteristics that provide the organisations with its capacity to undertake adaptation- and health-related work. Following Sowa et al. [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>], the premise for assessing organisation inputs is that a well-managed and structured organisation has a higher chance of delivering quality initiatives and hence achieving its goals.

  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par19" class="p">The organisation’s initiatives. Initiatives are projects and other mechanisms by which organisations work towards their goals. For example, the ADB pursues its goal of assisting member countries to adapt to health-related climate change impacts through its Strengthening Resilience to Climate Change in the Health Sector in the Greater Mekong Subregion (SRCC) project.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par20" class="p">The organisation’s outputs. Outputs are the immediate results of an initiative, and are distinct from longer-term outcomes. For example, outputs include training courses and awareness raising sessions, but do not refer to intended or unintended behaviour changes that result from these.</p>
