<p id="Par25" class="p">Research data was reviewed to gather evidence against each of the modified FAROCCCA indicators. Each indicator was rated, following the ‘traffic light method’ and qualitative assessment protocols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. The ratings were used principally as a means to highlight points of interest and comparisons between the organisations and their models of support. Each rating reflected the indicator wording. For example, where an indicator specified ‘evidence of’, lack of evidence resulted in a negative rating, but where an indicator specified a particular characteristic, lack of evidence of this resulted in a ‘no evidence’ rating.
