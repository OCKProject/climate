<p id="Par40" class="p">Both organisations’ outputs rated well. For example, the evidence gathered relating to the FAROCCCA sub-component on collaboration and advocacy shows that both organisations do work with stakeholders, although their methodologies differ. In this regard, the ADB has some limitations in collaborating with government agencies in the region. For example, “our Vietnamese partner, it is the first time we’ve worked with them, and they don’t understand the ADB procedures, and so because we work basically in one way – we’re giving you money, and you have to do it this way” [#13], with [#14] making similar remarks regarding Myanmar. Comparatively the APRF shows a greater collaborative focus. For example, there was a substantial amount of “back and forth through the focal points in the [national] agencies” to revise APRF operations [#03]. Similarly, the APRF successfully considered “ways of facilitating additional countries to participate in the Fourth Regional Ministerial Forum” ([

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. Both organisations also report positively on outputs relating more directly to climate and health. For example, in 2016 the APRF reported that 12, of its then 14 member states, had produced a NEHAP, with nine of the 12 including climate change as an environmental health issue [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. Both organisations also received positive ratings for engaging with stakeholders in relation to CCA and health. For example, the APRF has organised presentations on climate change and health for relevant ministers and senior government officials from 34 Asia-Pacific nations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>], and the ADB ran stakeholder consultation workshops regarding the direction of its SRCC project [
