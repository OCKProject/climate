<p id="Par36" class="p">The two initiatives have some similarities. First, both include a capacity building focus. The SRCC project seeks to enhance the “capacity of participating countries and health agencies in climate change adaptation” ([

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]), both organisations recognise the importance of quantitative evidence to build momentum on climate change and health concerns. The ADB’s SRCC project recommended the development of future plans “that include health impacts and evidence-based good practices on climate change and health for key sectors” ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>], Online), and the APRF has produced a 55-page synthesis report of members’ environment and health country profiles (EHCPs), including a five page chapter on climate change impacts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>]. Third, there is evidence that both initiatives fill an adaptation need. The CCTWG, because strengthening human resource capacity is considered as a priority issue for CCA and health (see e.g. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>]), and the ADB SRCC project documents include detailed information about climate change health impacts, including differentiation of causes between the three target countries.
