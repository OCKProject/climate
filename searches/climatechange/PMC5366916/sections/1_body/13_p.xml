<p class="p">The next step in the analysis involves projecting the QRA fingerprint (i.e. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>) onto the CMIP5 zonal mean temperature profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) using linear regression (see Methods). Examining both the full CMIP5 all-forcing simulations, (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>) and anthropogenic-only simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3b</xref>), we observe a large amount of variability among the individual realizations of the multimodel ensemble, again emphasizing the significant role of internal variability. A positive long-term trend is nonetheless evident in most realizations, and is clearly evident in the ensemble means (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). This trend is formally independent of global warming, since it reflects a change over time in a relative latitudinal pattern of temperature variation rather than any change in mean hemispheric or global warmth. Comparing the ensemble mean fingerprint series to the ensemble mean extratropical (25â€“75N) mean temperature for the all-forcing simulations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3c</xref>) nonetheless reveals a similar long-term increase consistent with polar amplification from anthropogenic warming.
