 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> demonstrated that Rossby waves within a certain wavenumber range can become effectively trapped in a latitudinal waveguide depending on the structure of the mid-latitude westerlies. Petoukhov 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> showed that if these waves have similar length-scales to those imposed by orographic and thermal forcing, a pronounced amplification of waves can occur due to resonance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The shape of the North-South profile of the zonal-mean westerlies influences the occurrence of this phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. This profile can change due to changes in the poleward temperature gradient and thus, to the Arctic amplification of greenhouse warming through the thermal wind equation. Tropical expansion can also affect the latitudinal position of the sharpest temperature gradients and latitudinal changes in the land-ocean temperature contrast might play a role as well.
