<p class="p">Using ERA interim reanalysis data and the QRA detection scheme presented in Kornhuber
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> (see Methods for details) we produced a composite of boreal summer (JJA) zonal mean near-surface (1000 mb) temperature profiles during QRA-favorable time intervals (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). Differencing the QRA-favorable and climatological mean profiles, we define an anomalous zonal mean temperature profile associated with QRA conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). We restrict the profile to the mid-latitude (25–75N) region of interest and center the profile on zero, yielding a “fingerprint” (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c</xref>) in the zonal mean temperature field associated with QRA-favorable conditions. The fingerprint exhibits negative values in the subtropics, increases to near-neutral values at 40N, a decline toward more negative values through 50N, and pronounced positive values again at higher sub-polar latitudes. While Arctic-amplified warming projects onto this latitudinal anomaly pattern, the fingerprint has considerably more latitudinal structure (including the contribution from an enhanced land/ocean contrast along the Arctic Ocean shore) than is characterized simply by polar amplification alone.
