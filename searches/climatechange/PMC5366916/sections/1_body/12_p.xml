<p class="p">The multimodel ensemble zonal mean surface temperatures for the relevant (JJA) season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) show the expected polar amplification of warming, with higher-latitude regions tending to warm more than lower-latitude regions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). This pattern is expected from the warm-season ice-albedo feedback associated with anthropogenic greenhouse warming, and it is considerably more pronounced in the anthropogenic-only forcing experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2b</xref>) where the complicating effects of volcanic forcing are absent. The full distribution of trends among the multimodel ensemble is shown for the mean extratropical (25â€“75N average) temperature series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). The series show considerable variability, emphasizing the potentially confounding role of internal variability in identifying clear trends in the zonal mean profiles in individual historical realizations (including the actual observed realization).
