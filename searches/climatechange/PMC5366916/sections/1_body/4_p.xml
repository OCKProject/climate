 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, the essence of the argument involves the relationship between changing zonal mean temperatures and the strength and position of maxima in the mid-latitude westerly jet. The main condition for resonance is the formation of a zonally-directed waveguide for a particular zonal wavenumber 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>, which depends only on the wavenumber and the shape of the zonal-mean zonal wind (
 <italic class="italic">U</italic>) profile. Such a waveguide is present when a mid-latitude region of positive squared meridional wavenumber 
 <italic class="italic">l</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is bounded by latitudes both north and south where 
 <italic class="italic">l</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> vanishes, inhibiting the dispersion of wave energy and trapping excited planetary waves in the upper troposphere (300–500 mb). This can occur for zonal wavenumbers
