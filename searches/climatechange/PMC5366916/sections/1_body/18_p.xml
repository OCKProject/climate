<p class="p">Finally, we apply the QRA fingerprint approach to observational surface temperature data available through 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). As with the CMIP5 historical simulations, we see the expected pattern of polar amplification of warming, regardless of which of three different surface temperature products (GISTEMP, HadCRUT4, and Cowtan &amp; Way) is used (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a,b,c</xref>). When we project the QRA fingerprint onto the zonal temperature profiles (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5d,e,f</xref>), we observe a significant trend in the QRA fingerprint during the post-1970 interval during which the CMIP5 simulations display a prominent trend. The trend is significant at the 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.05 level for all three instrumental temperature datasets (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). While the trends in the observational fingerprint series are modestly greater (0.016–0.022 units/year) than those for the CMIP5 multimodel mean series, both are in agreement taking into account respective one sigma ranges (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The QRA fingerprint series for one of the surface temperature datasets (GISTEMP) exhibits positive values during the early decades of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century that rival recent values. Examining 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a–c</xref>, it is apparent that high-latitude warmth substantially exceeds low-latitude warmth during these decades for GISTEMP, though this is not seen in the other datasets. We suspect that the GISTEMP approach of spatially-interpolating across the Arctic based on what data are available, becomes increasingly susceptible to large sampling uncertainties as data in this region become exceptionally sparse in earlier decades. That could lead to spurious amplification of high-latitude meridional temperature gradients that project substantially onto the QRA fingerprint.
