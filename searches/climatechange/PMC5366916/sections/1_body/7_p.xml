<p class="p">Our approach is conceptually similar
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> to statistical downscaling of climate model simulations: We utilize large-scale features of the climate model simulations considered reliable (in this case, meridional temperature gradients) and then exploit a robust empirical relationship that exists between that feature and the response of interest (planetary wave dynamics related to QRA). It is well-documented that climate models reasonably well capture changes in global patterns of surface temperature, which are primarily thermodynamically controlled. In contrast, there is much less confidence in circulation aspects of climate change, which are primarily controlled by dynamics

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>— an issue we will examine later– are still likely to get the QRA fingerprint right, allowing us to draw reliable real-world conclusions about how climate change may impact the phenomenon of QRA.
