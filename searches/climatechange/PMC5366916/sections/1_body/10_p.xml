<p class="p">The anomalous meridional temperature gradient associated with the fingerprint (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d</xref>) is characterized by a large positive peak in the mid-latitude zone of 50â€“65N, which, via thermal wind, implies a more-pronounced minimum in the zonal mean zonal wind and thus promotes the formation of a double jet. More poleward (i.e. beyond 65N) the reduction in the temperature gradient (and thus a stronger
