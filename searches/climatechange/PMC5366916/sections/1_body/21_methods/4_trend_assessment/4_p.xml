<p class="p">We also diagnosed trends for the full CMIP5 multimodel ensemble, assessing the +/−1 sigma range (or more precisely, the 16%ile and 84%ile of the distribution, which is slightly asymmetric with respect to the mean) across the ensemble as reported in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. We also calculated, as a measure of robustness across the multi-model ensemble, the percent of ensemble members (“% &gt; 0” in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) with positive trends and performed Monte Carlo simulations (10,000 realizations) modeling each multi-model ensemble member fingerprint series as AR(1) red noise (preserving the standard deviation and lag-one autocorrelation of the series). Using the distribution among the Monte Carlo surrogates of the 1970–2005 trends across the multimodel ensemble, we then assessed
