<p class="p">For the observational series, trends were calculated both for the 1970–2005 (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 36) interval of overlap with the CMIP5 historical simulations, and for the longer 1970–2015 (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 46 years) updated to include the most recent decade of observations. In both cases, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> values were assessed by taking into account reduced degrees of freedom owing to serial correlation of regression residuals via 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>’ = 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>(1 − 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>)/(1 + 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>) where 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> is the lag-one autocorrelation coefficient of the actual series (
