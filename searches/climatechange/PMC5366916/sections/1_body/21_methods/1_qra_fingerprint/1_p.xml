<p class="p">We used the QRA detection scheme of Kornhuber

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> but in this case applied it to near-surface temperature rather than upper level winds, to develop a zonal mean QRA temperature fingerprint. We used the Jun-Aug (JJA) 1979–2015 ERA interim reanalysis (2.5° × 2.5°). Near-surface atmospheric temperature profiles were calculated using z = 1000 mb daily data over the full Northern Hemisphere (0°N–90°N) in 37 steps (2.5°). We focused on long duration (≥10 days) wavenumber 7 events to define QRA-favorable time intervals, and confined zonal-mean profiles to the mid-latitude latitude range (25N–75N) analyzed in previous work
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Such events have been shown to be closely related to Northern Hemisphere JJA heat extremes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. The fingerprint was interpolated to a 5° latitude grid that is consistent with the grid of the model simulations and observational datas (see below) and centered on zero. This yields an 11 element zero-centered row vector that defines the QRA fingerprint.
