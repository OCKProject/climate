<p class="p">The post-1970 trend of 0.006 units/year in the multimodel mean fingerprint series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3c</xref>) is highly significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001). Of greater interest, however, is the behavior of individual ensemble members given that the historical changes observed reflect a single realization of internal natural variability. Examining the distribution of trends from the full multimodel ensemble, the median trend lies close to the mean trend, and 68% of the multimodel realizations exhibit a positive trend, which is highly unlikely to have arisen from chance (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.0001 based on the null hypothesis of red noise; see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and Methods). Nonetheless, nearly one third of the realizations thereby do 
 <italic class="italic">not</italic> display a positive trend, suggesting that, if the CMIP5 historical simulations are an accurate representation of the distribution of possible historical scenarios, an anthropogenic increase in QRA-favorable conditions is only 
 <italic class="italic">likely</italic> (and not 
 <italic class="italic">very likely</italic>) in the IPCC lexicon, to be observed in any specific realization of historical temperature variability, including the unique realization that we have actually observed.
