 <result pre="colleagues, accumulation dynamics of this kind are central to understanding" exact="climate" post="change mitigation, as accumulated CO 2 can be viewed"/>
 <result pre="can be viewed as a stock affected by inflows (i.e.," exact="anthropogenic" post="CO 2 emissions), as well as outflows (i.e., natural"/>
 <result pre="and oceans). Because warming is driven by the accumulation of" exact="atmospheric" post="CO 2 emissions (i.e., whenever the rate of inflow"/>
 <result pre="is greater than the rate of outflow), it follows that" exact="climate" post="change mitigation hinges, minimally, on stabilization of the stock"/>

 <result pre="individuals (and nations) are likely to adopt in relation to" exact="climate" post="change mitigation. At the level of individuals, economic concerns"/>
 <result pre="about wages and job availability heavily influence people’s views about" exact="climate" post="change intervention[ 24]. At the national level, economic down"/>
 <result pre="are often associated with a decline in public concerns about" exact="climate" post="change[ 25– 26]. Similarly, national and international decisions about"/>
