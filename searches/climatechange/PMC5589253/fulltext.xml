It follows that collective action on climate change depends on members of the public to be knowledgeable of the causes and economic ramifications of climate change. The existing literature, however, shows that people often struggle to correctly reason about the fundamental accumulation dynamics that drive climate change. Previous research has focused on using analogy to improve people&#x02019;s reasoning about accumulation, which has been met with some success. However, these existing studies have neglected the role economic factors might play in shaping people&#x02019;s decisions in relation to climate change. Here, we introduce a novel iterated decision task in which people attempt to achieve a specific economic goal by interacting with a causal dynamic system in which human economic activities, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and warming are all causally interrelated. We show that when the causal links between these factors are highlighted, people&#x02019;s ability to achieve the economic goal of the task is enhanced in a way that approaches optimal responding, and avoids dangerous levels of warming.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP130102229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kashima</surname><given-names>Yoshihisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE140100772</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sewell</surname><given-names>David K.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project Grant (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arc.gov.au">www.arc.gov.au</ext-link>; DP130102229) awarded to Yoshihisa Kashima, Angela Paladino, and David Sewell.

As noted by Newell, McDonald, Brewer, and Hayes[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], tackling this problem requires an understanding of how people think and reason about (1) environmental systems, and (2) the (adverse) effects that human activities have on these systems. A key insight is that the problem of climate change mitigation can be understood in terms of the more general problem of how people manage and control dynamic causal systems[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Osman[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] provided a recent review of the multitude of tasks that have been developed to investigate how people interact with, and manage, dynamic systems, and the different classes of theories that have been developed to explain performance. A common finding is that people often lack insight into the rules, or interactions among variables, that govern how these systems behave. It follows that the <italic>mental models</italic>&#x02014;the psychological representation of system variables and their effects&#x02014;people rely on to complete these tasks are lacking in important ways[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Generally speaking, people&#x02019;s mental models of complex systems inaccurately represent and/or relate variables to one another[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], are missing important mechanistic relationships[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and misrepresent the underlying system dynamics[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It follows, then, that people&#x02019;s ability to control causal dynamic systems tends to be quite poor[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A practical challenge lies in identifying ways in which people&#x02019;s reasoning about causal dynamic systems can be improved, such that better management and control outcomes can be achieved.</p><p>The need to improve the accuracy of people&#x02019;s mental models is especially important for climate change mitigation. Several authors view an accurate mental model of climate change as a necessary step toward adoption of effective mitigation policies[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, it is known that laypeople possess highly inaccurate mental models about the causes of climate change[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and that they do not accurately represent the stock-and-flow dynamics that govern the accumulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Because misconceptions about climate change dynamics have been argued to encourage complacency with respect to climate change mitigation[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], a goal of recent research has been to identify ways of overcoming the limitations of people&#x02019;s mental models to improve their understanding of climate change dynamics. These studies have focused on improving people&#x02019;s reasoning about accumulation dynamics in tasks with an explicit environmental goal: to stabilize levels of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In this article, we build upon this work, by investigating performance in a novel repeated-decision task, where people have an explicit <italic>economic</italic> goal to achieve&#x02014;rather than an environmental goal&#x02014;but their progress toward that goal can be hindered by negative effects of global warming within the system. We show that people&#x02019;s ability to achieve the economic goal is tied to receiving accurate causal knowledge about the system variables. Causal knowledge about the interactions between economic and climate variables within the system appears to bias people toward more cautious means-ends pursuit of the economic goal. The effect of causal knowledge appears to be robust over time and incremental changes in the state of the causal system, and persists for over two hundred consecutive decisions.</p><p>We proceed by reviewing previous studies that have examined people&#x02019;s ability to manage accumulation dynamics in climate change tasks. We discuss some of the methodological limitations of these studies before introducing our novel repeated-decision task. We then consider how a na&#x000ef;ve decision-maker might approach the task, based on causal model-based, exemplar-based and hypothesis-testing perspectives on how people manage dynamic causal systems, and consider how causal knowledge might affect performance through the lens of these theoretical frameworks.</p><sec id="sec002"><title>Accumulation dynamics and climate change: Previous studies</title><p>It is now well established that people often have difficulty controlling and accurately predicting the behavior of systems that are defined by accumulation dynamics[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In these systems, the quantity of a stock is affected by inflows and outflows to the system, respectively increasing and decreasing the quantity of stock. As noted repeatedly by Sterman and colleagues, accumulation dynamics of this kind are central to understanding climate change mitigation, as accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> can be viewed as a stock affected by inflows (i.e., anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions), as well as outflows (i.e., natural carbon sinks, such as forests and oceans). Because warming is driven by the accumulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (i.e., whenever the rate of inflow is greater than the rate of outflow), it follows that climate change mitigation hinges, minimally, on stabilization of the stock of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Sterman and Booth Sweeney[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] introduced a <italic>climate stabilization task</italic> intended to assess how people reason about accumulation dynamics applicable to climate change mitigation. People were shown graphs illustrating the stabilization of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (the stock) at some time in the future. People were also shown a graph of the recent history of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions (the inflow) along with the current rate at which CO<sub>2</sub> was removed from the atmosphere (the outflow). The task was to sketch trajectories of emissions and passive CO<sub>2</sub> removal&#x02014;the latter could effectively be assumed to be constant&#x02014;that would achieve stabilization of the stock illustrated in the first graph. The results of this task showed that people frequently failed to identify that stabilization of the stock could only be achieved when the rate of inflow (CO<sub>2</sub> emissions) matched the rate of outflow (passive removal of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>). Instead, people&#x02019;s projected emissions rates consistently exceeded the rate at which CO<sub>2</sub> was removed, highlighting a failure to understand the fundamental accumulation dynamics that drive global warming.</p><p>Subsequent studies have sought to improve people&#x02019;s performance on the climate stabilization task by providing analogies to assist people&#x02019;s reasoning. For example, Guy, Kashima, Walker, and O&#x02019;Neill[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] likened accumulation of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> to water filling a bathtub, and found that presentation of the bathtub analogy reduced the extent to which people overestimated emissions rates needed to stabilize CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The effectiveness of analogy is not unconditional, however, and depends on a number of other factors, such as level of education[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the presence or absence of graphical displays of inflows and outflows[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], as well as the specific content of the analogy presented[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Extending previous research</title><p>A limitation of previous climate stabilization studies, such as those by Guy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], Newell et al. [<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and Sterman and Booth Sweeney[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] is that people were not provided with an opportunity to observe the accumulation dynamics of the system by interacting with it. Moxnes and Saysel[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] investigated a version of the climate stabilization task where people could observe the effects of emissions on CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation over successive 10-year intervals. They found that people who were able to observe the system dynamics in this way performed better than people who did not have an opportunity to observe the effects of emissions on accumulation. Similarly, Dutt and Gonzalez[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] investigated the effect of observing the system dynamics, via interacting with the system, on subsequent performance on the climate stabilization task. They introduced an iterated version of Sterman and Booth Sweeney&#x02019;s[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation scenario, where people were required to enter values that set rates of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and removal of CO<sub>2</sub> on a trial-by-trial basis to track the trajectory of the accumulated stock of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> through time. People who had the opportunity to observe the accumulation dynamics by interacting with the system performed better on the climate stabilization task compared to people who did not get a chance to interact with the system beforehand.</p><p>A more detailed examination of the way feedback about accumulation dynamics affects people&#x02019;s ability to manage a (simulated) climate system was reported by Dutt and Gonzalez[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They presented people with an iterated version of the climate stabilization task, requiring participants to keep CO<sub>2</sub> concentration within a particular range of values on a trial-by-trial basis. When CO<sub>2</sub> levels exceeded the acceptable range for that trial, people incurred an economic penalty&#x02014;which affected whether they received a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment&#x02014;and thus had an opportunity to receive fine-grained feedback about their performance in the task. This study found that people&#x02019;s ability to stabilize the climate system over the long-term was improved when feedback was more frequent and when system variables respond faster to changes in emissions levels. The latter echoes earlier findings that people often struggle to stabilize dynamic systems that incorporate time delays and feedback loops[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>A common feature of previous research has been the use of tasks that include an explicit climate stabilization goal. In all of the key studies reviewed thus far, people were specifically tasked with identifying a level of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that will stabilize the stock of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. This focus potentially ignores the role that economic factors play in shaping the stances that individuals (and nations) are likely to adopt in relation to climate change mitigation. At the level of individuals, economic concerns about wages and job availability heavily influence people&#x02019;s views about climate change intervention[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. At the national level, economic down turns are often associated with a decline in public concerns about climate change[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly, national and international decisions about climate change mitigation will be strongly influenced by the estimated costs of climate change mitigation[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It follows that understanding how people make decisions about managing the earth&#x02019;s climate will be informed by, and perhaps principally decided by, economic considerations.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Current study</title><p>In this article, we examine how people interact with a (simulated) climate system when their goal is economic, rather than environmental, in nature. We further examine the effect causal knowledge about the system variables has on people&#x02019;s ability to achieve the economic goal. To this end, we introduce a novel iterated decision task, where economic decisions are directly linked to environmental outcomes, which, in turn, affect people&#x02019;s ability to achieve an economic goal. Like previous studies that have used iterated decision tasks[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], the responses made by people in our task drive changes in the state of the climate system. That is, people&#x02019;s chosen actions produce emissions that affect the accumulated stock of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>, and the level of global warming. Unlike previous research, the actions that people in our study take are <italic>economic actions</italic>, rather than environmental actions. Instead of setting levels of emissions directly&#x02014;as in previous climate stabilization tasks&#x02014;people&#x02019;s responses drive changes to an economy they are managing. In our task, people&#x02019;s economic actions are not tied to an explicit environmental goal. Participants are not instructed to stabilize CO<sub>2</sub> levels, rather, their goal is to grow the economy such that it is at least doubled by the end of the task. However, the climate and economic systems in our task are linked such that increases in warming make it progressively more difficult to achieve economic growth. By providing people with an explicit economic goal, our task incorporates, in a novel way, a tension between achieving economic growth on the one hand, and managing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the other.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Task overview: Managing a dynamic human-climate system</title><p>In our task, people adopt the role of a policy director setting annual economic targets, with an explicit goal to double the size of the economy by the end of the experiment.

The panels illustrate the dynamics of the economic index, CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, and warming under five different levels of responding&#x02014;for simplicity, constant economic targets are used in the figure.</p><p>To get intuition about the behavior of the system, it is useful to consider how changes in responding affect levels of CO<sub>2</sub>, warming, and the economic index. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184480.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows that there are strict order relations between responding and both CO<sub>2</sub> and warming&#x02014;higher levels of economic activity result in increased emissions, and, in turn, increased warming. It is also clear from the figure that these order relations do not hold for the economic index. Owing to the harmful effect of warming on economic performance (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002">Eq 2</xref>), the relationship between responding and the economic index is nonmonotonic. Although setting high growth targets early in the task generates substantial economic growth, the high level of emissions associated with this response pattern makes it such that, toward the end of the task, high levels of warming prevent economic growth, leading to subsequent declines in the economic index. By contrast, lower productivity targets result in smaller, but sustained, economic growth over the duration of the task.</p><p>Several other properties of the human-climate system are especially noteworthy. First, the system is defined by time delays and multiple non-linear interactions among variables that are not visible to the participant. These factors make it virtually impossible to predict the quantitative behavior of the system through observation alone. Although people can uncover simple causal structure&#x02014;usually involving linear, but probabilistic, relations among variables with no time delays&#x02014;quite well through analyzing the effects their behavioral interventions have on the system[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], people&#x02019;s ability to predict and control systems with more complex dynamics, like our human-climate system, can be quite poor[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Because our principal experimental manipulation involves providing some, but not all, participants with causal knowledge about the relationship between economic activities, CO<sub>2</sub>, and warming, having a low expected baseline level of performance is advantageous. If causal knowledge from the outset of the task confers a performance benefit, there should be ample room to observe its effect in the data.</p><p>The second noteworthy aspect of our task has to do with the presence of time delays within the system[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In our task, people are able to adjust their responding across successive trials to adapt to changes in the system state during the task. However, time delays in the system&#x02014;particularly with regards to temperature (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e004">Eq 4</xref>)&#x02014;mean that, by the time the harmful effects of warming on economic growth become apparent, even quite radical changes in responding may not be enough to counteract the problem. Once warming increases past a certain point, no level of responding will result in economic growth (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002">Eq 2</xref>). A key question is whether people are able to avoid this &#x0201c;point of no return&#x0201d; without causal knowledge of the relationship between the economic and climate variables in the system.</p></sec><sec id="sec006"><title>Ways of approaching the task: Effects of causal knowledge</title><p>How might individuals respond in our task to achieve the economic goal of doubling the size of the economy by the end of the experiment? How might people&#x02019;s response strategies be affected by causal knowledge of the system variables? Because people in our task have an explicit economic goal to achieve (i.e., doubling the size of the economy) and a clear means of achieving that goal (i.e., responding by setting large economic growth targets), we assume that people will tend to adopt a means-ends approach to the task. That is, we expect people to set economic growth targets that will promote rapid growth of the economic index, given the absence of relevant causal knowledge. Because of the time delays involved in warming driven by accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> (Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e004">4</xref>), this pattern of responding will promote positive interim outcomes&#x02014;rapid progress toward achieving the economic goal of the task. Accordingly, it would be predicted on the basis of instance theories[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], hypothesis-testing perspectives[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], as well as causal model-based theories[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], that people would favor responding in this way for the duration of the task. Once warming increases to the point where economic growth is harmed&#x02014;or even prevented&#x02014;the predictions from these theories become less clear. Under instance theory, people will not have a bank of similar trial instances to retrieve once economic growth targets fail to achieve growth on a given trial, and so it is possible that people might persist in setting high growth targets. Under a hypothesis-testing framework, people may similarly be expected to persist in setting high growth targets, as doing otherwise would result in moving people away from achieving the economic goal (i.e., setting <italic>negative</italic> growth targets would reduce the economic index). However, because high levels of warming would prevent even high growth targets from increasing the economic index (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002">Eq 2</xref>), people might attempt to change their response pattern by inferring from feedback, that their current strategy is ineffective. Under a causal model-based approach, we would expect people to have developed a mental model of the task that incorporates a strong positive relationship between growth targets and approach toward the economic goal. Accordingly, people would be expected to persist in setting high growth targets even after high levels of warming begin to limit increases to the economic index (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002">Eq 2</xref>).</p><p>When people have access to causal knowledge about the relationship between the climate and economic variables in the system, we expect people to still apply a straightforward means-ends approach to the task. However, we predict that people would adopt a more conservative response profile, where relatively lower economic growth targets are set at the outset and persist at relatively low levels for the duration of the task. The expected effect of causal knowledge is perhaps most readily understood in terms of hypothesis-testing approaches[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and causal model-based perspectives[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], as people would be aware that allowing warming to increase would have a strong negative effect on their ability to achieve the economic goal. It follows that under both of these frameworks, people would be predicted to set more conservative economic growth targets in an effort to avoid the harmful effects of warming on their ability to grow the economic index. In sum, we expect that people will not manage the task well unless they are provided with causal knowledge about the system variables at the outset of the task.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Overview of experiments</title><p>Our principal experimental manipulation involves a knowledge-based intervention where the causal relationship among economic activities, CO<sub>2</sub>, and warming variables, is (Informed condition), or is not (Uninformed condition) explicitly revealed to people at the outset of the task (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184480.s001">S1 Text</xref> for details). Contrasting performance across the two conditions reveals whether causal knowledge affects people&#x02019;s ability to achieve the economic goal in light of the negative effects of warming. Given that people are known to perform poorly in tasks involving non-linear systems with time delays[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we expect causal knowledge to bias people&#x02019;s interactions with the system such that they favor more conservative responding. This will, in turn, improve their ability to achieve the economic goal of the task and avoid harmful effects of warming.</p><p>We were also concerned that the labels for the system variables&#x02014;specifically, CO<sub>2</sub>, and warming&#x02014;might introduce a demand effect, especially among our university sample in Experiment 1, that could artificially bias people toward more conservative responding. To determine whether any benefits of causal knowledge were restricted to variables involved in climate change, we ran a separate version of the task using a different cover story involving fictitious bacterial populations. Importantly, the system dynamics&#x02014;based on known accumulation dynamics involved in the carbon cycle&#x02014;were identical across the two versions of the task (i.e., governed by Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e004">4</xref>). However, the labels for the system variables were different. Given that knowledge effects are frequently found using a variety of cover stories in the causal learning literature[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we expected similar results across the different cover story conditions.</p><p>Across two experiments, using a university student sample and a sample of the general public, we show that causal knowledge improves people&#x02019;s ability to achieve the economic goal of our task whilst avoiding (economically) harmful levels of warming. We show that the beneficial effect of causal knowledge is not restricted to the climate change domain: When the same system dynamics were presented in the context of managing a population of bacteria, the same pattern of effects emerged, ruling out experimental demand characteristics and ideological views on climate change as explanations for our data. Finally, we show that, when provided with causal knowledge, responding approaches what could be considered an optimal profile for the task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Experiment 1: Australian university sample</title><sec id="sec009" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Method</title><sec id="sec010"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>Both experiments were approved by and conducted in compliance with the University of Melbourne Human Research Ethics Committee.

Given the explicit economic goals of the task though, a pertinent question is how well people <italic>could</italic> perform in our task, given the instructions. To this end, we conducted an optimal response analysis. The aim of the analysis was to identify the response profile that maximized the average of (1) the mean economic index over the course of the task, and (2) the economic index at a time point beyond the life of the task (i.e., at trial 300). These criteria map onto the instructions to (1) maximize the overall economic index, and (2) aim to at least double the size of the economy by the end of the task. For the latter criterion, evaluating the size of the economy at trial 300&#x02014;rather than trial 250&#x02014;was chosen to reduce the influence of end-of-task artifacts associated with optimization (e.g., excess warming will not penalize economic growth immediately due to time delays in the human-climate system, which means that the optimal way to respond on the last 20&#x02013;30 trials is to set the highest possible economic growth targets; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184480.s001">S1 Text</xref> for complete details).</p><p>For the optimal response analysis, we adopted a parameter estimation approach. For our initial analyses, we divided the task into 25 equally-sized response intervals (i.e., for 300 trials, each response interval comprised 12 trials). Using a standard simplex algorithm, we estimated, for each interval, an economic target from the range of responses available to participants (i.e., the interval of -5 to +5), which maximized the joint optimization criteria. Our initial analyses revealed that much of the estimated optimal response functions had a clear exponential form. We also found that across different optimization runs, estimates for the early response intervals were quite volatile. This makes sense, as the effects of the earliest responses can, to some extent, be offset by later ones, given the optimization criteria we used. To improve stability and better avoid local minima&#x02014;and greatly reduce the time required for optimization&#x02014;we considered an exponential response function,

Although this ramping up of economic growth targets partially reflects an &#x0201c;end-of-task&#x0201d; artifact&#x02014;due to time lags in the human-climate system, the warming that would result from the increase in economic activity toward the end of the task does not have sufficient time to provoke a reduction in the economic index (see Eqs <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e004">4</xref>)&#x02014;participants in our experiments also tended to increase economic growth targets in the latter part of the task. The most striking aspect of the optimal response profile is in how similar it is to performance of the informed participants over the course of the task. One implication is that causal knowledge may lead people to behave in a way that is not only sustainable, but more closely approximates optimal management of the human-climate system. This is consistent with the idea that causal knowledge results in improved, but imperfect, performance in a variety of causal inference tasks[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>General discussion</title><p>A fairly common view among researchers is that adoption of effective climate change mitigation policies depends on people having an accurate mental model of the processes that lead to global warming[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, people have repeatedly been shown to struggle to understand the fundamental accumulation dynamics that are involved[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We investigated the effect of providing people with causal knowledge about the variables involved in CO<sub>2</sub> accumulation and warming in the context of a novel iterated decision task where pursuit of an economic goal drove changes in the climate system. We showed that providing people with up-front information about relevant causal relationships in the human-climate system resulted in improved task performance, suggesting that people successfully used this causal knowledge to guide their responding in the task. The basic pattern of results was replicated in a parallel set of experiments that framed the decision task in terms of managing a fictitious bacterial population, suggesting that the benefits of receiving causal knowledge were not restricted to variables related to climate change. We further showed that receiving causal knowledge about the underlying system resulted in decision-making performance that approached an optimal response profile.</p><sec id="sec022"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although our study extended existing work on the effect of knowledge in reasoning about climate change[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], it is not without its limitations. We discuss several limitations and potential concerns about (1) distinguishing effects of causal knowledge from response bias, (2) the way economic activities were represented in the human-climate system, and (3) whether our results will scale up from individual decision-makers to collectives.</p><p>As noted by reviewers, it is possible that our manipulation of causal knowledge simply induced a favorable response bias in participants in the Informed condition. We acknowledge that, while we cannot completely rule this out as a possible explanation, the fact that people in the Informed condition produced response profiles that adapted to the changing demands of the task&#x02014;increasing economic productivity targets to potentially compensate for the negative effects of warming on economic growth toward the end of the task (see Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184480.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184480.g004">4</xref>)&#x02014;speaks against a simple response bias account. Nevertheless it would be worth investigating whether instruction to simply produce low economic growth targets early on in the task, without providing any other information about how the variables interact, would produce a different response profile in the Informed condition than the causal knowledge intervention we used in the current experiments. One possibility is that promoting a response bias (without causal knowledge) would result in no difference in performance compared to the Informed condition. We suspect, however, that without causal knowledge, people may be reluctant to continue making conservative economic growth targets when the system dynamics&#x02014;at least in the early stage in the task&#x02014;provide no compelling reason to do so. Although people will achieve economic growth when responding conservatively, exploration of the effects of responding with higher economic growth targets would reveal that more rapid economic growth could be achieved. Ultimately, this is an empirical question that awaits future research.</p><p>Another potential limitation of our study was in the way economic activities were implemented in the human-climate system. Rather than having economic growth being characterized in terms of the aggregate of a number of different kinds of economic activities (e.g., different types of industry with potentially different carbon intensities), we relied on only a single, monolithic, economic sector. We readily acknowledge that this limits the realism of our human-climate system, but note that increasing the complexity of what is already a complex system is likely to result in poor performance, which can create substantial difficulties inferring people&#x02019;s decision strategies from data[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Put another way, the (over-)simplified economic aspect of our human-climate system is a feature, rather than a bug. It is nevertheless an interesting question to investigate what effect, if any, providing people with different economic response alternatives will have on people&#x02019;s ability to manage the human-climate system.</p><p>Finally, we note that the current study investigated individual decision-making behavior, whereas the problem of climate change mitigation is unequivocally a problem of <italic>collective</italic> decision-making. We conjecture that providing the public with better information about the underlying causes of climate change&#x02014;in addition to the strong scientific consensus on the role of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions&#x02014;will produce decision-making benefits at the group level. As the proportion of well-informed decision-makers increases, it is reasonable to suspect that the quality of decisions made by aggregations of such agents will also be improved.</p><p>At the same time, results that identify highly polarized opinions along political lines implies that provision of relevant information may not produce the desired effects on group decision-making unless the information is presented in a way that resonates with diverse socio-economic values[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Causal knowledge may yet be important though, as extreme political positions have been shown to be relaxed when people holding such views are prompted to provide causal explanations to support their views[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Fostering higher levels of knowledge about climate change issues may serve to reduce the extent of polarization[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Ultimately, the tension between knowledge, values, and polarization remains an interesting issue that warrants further research.</p></sec><sec id="sec023"><title>Relationship to climate change attitudes</title><p>An important question left open by our research is how a causal knowledge intervention, which we have shown to influence people&#x02019;s economic decision-making behavior, relates to more general attitudes about climate change mitigation. It is now established that knowledge about the causes of climate change is a key driver of climate change acceptance among the general public[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. At a more practical level, relevant causal knowledge about climate change has also been shown to increase people&#x02019;s intention to engage in mitigation behavior[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], as well as levels of support for implementing climate change mitigation policies[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. It follows that possessing relevant causal knowledge about climate change dynamics&#x02014;and the pivotal role that human (economic) activities play in driving these dynamics&#x02014;has the capacity to influence how people think about the climate system, and importantly, consider how their actions might adversely affect it[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. At minimum, it seems that equipping people with relevant causal knowledge will make achieving collective action on climate change more likely to happen.</p></sec><sec id="sec024" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results of our study show that when people are made aware of the economic ramifications of climate change, they alter the way they make decisions about satisfying an economic goal. By showing a beneficial effect of causal knowledge on people&#x02019;s decision-making, our study reinforces the utility of knowledge-based interventions in advancing public debate on climate change mitigation. Highlighting the critical role of human CO<sub>2</sub> emissions in causing climate change coupled with the economic risks posed by climate change produced a dramatic reduction in the economic targets people set. Specifically, people appeared able to forego short-term economic gains if they knew that doing so would increase the likelihood that continued growth over the long-term could be achieved. This resulted in long-term economic sustainability and significantly better environmental outcomes (viz. less accumulated CO<sub>2</sub> and less warming) compared to when no causal information was provided. Given the role of causal knowledge in evaluating the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and their socio-economic implications[<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0184480.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>], we believe our results reinforce the idea that relevant knowledge improves people&#x02019;s decision-making with regards to climate change mitigation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec025"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184480.s001"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Participant instructions and additional analyses.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184480.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184480.s002"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Data from Experiment 1.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184480.s002.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0184480.s003"><label>S2 File</label><caption><title>Data from Experiment 2.</title><p>(SAV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0184480.s003.sav"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank David Karoly, Daniel Little, and Ailie Gallant for comments and discussion during the early development of the project.
