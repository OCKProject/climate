<p class="p">An important question left open by our research is how a causal knowledge intervention, which we have shown to influence people’s economic decision-making behavior, relates to more general attitudes about climate change mitigation. It is now established that knowledge about the causes of climate change is a key driver of climate change acceptance among the general public[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. At a more practical level, relevant causal knowledge about climate change has also been shown to increase people’s intention to engage in mitigation behavior[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. It follows that possessing relevant causal knowledge about climate change dynamics—and the pivotal role that human (economic) activities play in driving these dynamics—has the capacity to influence how people think about the climate system, and importantly, consider how their actions might adversely affect it[
