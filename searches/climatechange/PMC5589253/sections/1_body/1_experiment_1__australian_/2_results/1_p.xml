<p class="p">The results of Experiment 1 are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184480.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. For ease of exposition, we describe results and effects using the variables labels from the climate change cover story condition. The four panels of the figure plot trajectories of people’s responses (i.e., economic targets) along with trajectories of the size of the economy, excess CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and warming (which are determined by the underlying system dynamics). Data were binned into 10 25-trial epochs, and were averaged across participants within each condition. Data for each variable (response, economic index, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and temperature) were analyzed with a 2 (Information Condition: Informed vs. Uninformed) × 2 (Cover Story: Climate vs. Bacteria) × 10 (Trial Epoch) between-within ANOVA. Because of the large number of variables analyzed, we restrict our discussion to the most relevant effects (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184480.s001" class="xref">S1 Text</xref> for additional analyses).
