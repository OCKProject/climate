<p class="p">In our task, people adopt the role of a policy director setting annual economic targets, with an explicit goal to double the size of the economy by the end of the experiment. On each trial in the experiment, people are shown numerical values reporting the current size of the economy, concentration of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and global mean temperature. The participant then sets an economic growth target, which updates the size of the economy, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and temperature. The relationship between variables in the human-climate system used in our task is summarized schematically in
