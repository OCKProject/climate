<p class="p">To get intuition about the behavior of the system, it is useful to consider how changes in responding affect levels of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, warming, and the economic index. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184480.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows that there are strict order relations between responding and both CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and warmingâ€”higher levels of economic activity result in increased emissions, and, in turn, increased warming. It is also clear from the figure that these order relations do not hold for the economic index. Owing to the harmful effect of warming on economic performance (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0184480.e002" class="xref">Eq 2</xref>), the relationship between responding and the economic index is nonmonotonic. Although setting high growth targets early in the task generates substantial economic growth, the high level of emissions associated with this response pattern makes it such that, toward the end of the task, high levels of warming prevent economic growth, leading to subsequent declines in the economic index. By contrast, lower productivity targets result in smaller, but sustained, economic growth over the duration of the task.
