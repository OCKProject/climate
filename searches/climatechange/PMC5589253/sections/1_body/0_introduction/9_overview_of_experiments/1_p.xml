<p class="p">Our principal experimental manipulation involves a knowledge-based intervention where the causal relationship among economic activities, CO

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184480.s001" class="xref">S1 Text</xref> for details). Contrasting performance across the two conditions reveals whether causal knowledge affects people’s ability to achieve the economic goal in light of the negative effects of warming. Given that people are known to perform poorly in tasks involving non-linear systems with time delays[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], we expect causal knowledge to bias people’s interactions with the system such that they favor more conservative responding. This will, in turn, improve their ability to achieve the economic goal of the task and avoid harmful effects of warming.
