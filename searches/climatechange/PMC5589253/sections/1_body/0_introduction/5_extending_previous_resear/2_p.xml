<p class="p">A more detailed examination of the way feedback about accumulation dynamics affects people’s ability to manage a (simulated) climate system was reported by Dutt and Gonzalez[
 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. They presented people with an iterated version of the climate stabilization task, requiring participants to keep CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration within a particular range of values on a trial-by-trial basis. When CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels exceeded the acceptable range for that trial, people incurred an economic penalty—which affected whether they received a monetary bonus at the end of the experiment—and thus had an opportunity to receive fine-grained feedback about their performance in the task. This study found that people’s ability to stabilize the climate system over the long-term was improved when feedback was more frequent and when system variables respond faster to changes in emissions levels. The latter echoes earlier findings that people often struggle to stabilize dynamic systems that incorporate time delays and feedback loops[
