<p class="p">A common feature of previous research has been the use of tasks that include an explicit climate stabilization goal. In all of the key studies reviewed thus far, people were specifically tasked with identifying a level of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions that will stabilize the stock of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This focus potentially ignores the role that economic factors play in shaping the stances that individuals (and nations) are likely to adopt in relation to climate change mitigation. At the level of individuals, economic concerns about wages and job availability heavily influence people’s views about climate change intervention[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Similarly, national and international decisions about climate change mitigation will be strongly influenced by the estimated costs of climate change mitigation[
