 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] investigated a version of the climate stabilization task where people could observe the effects of emissions on CO

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] investigated the effect of observing the system dynamics, via interacting with the system, on subsequent performance on the climate stabilization task. They introduced an iterated version of Sterman and Booth Sweeneyâ€™s[

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> accumulation scenario, where people were required to enter values that set rates of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions and removal of CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> through time. People who had the opportunity to observe the accumulation dynamics by interacting with the system performed better on the climate stabilization task compared to people who did not get a chance to interact with the system beforehand.
