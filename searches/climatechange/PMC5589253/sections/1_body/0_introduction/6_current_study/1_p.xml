<p class="p">In this article, we examine how people interact with a (simulated) climate system when their goal is economic, rather than environmental, in nature. We further examine the effect causal knowledge about the system variables has on people’s ability to achieve the economic goal. To this end, we introduce a novel iterated decision task, where economic decisions are directly linked to environmental outcomes, which, in turn, affect people’s ability to achieve an economic goal. Like previous studies that have used iterated decision tasks[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], the responses made by people in our task drive changes in the state of the climate system. That is, people’s chosen actions produce emissions that affect the accumulated stock of atmospheric CO

 <italic class="italic">economic actions</italic>, rather than environmental actions. Instead of setting levels of emissions directly—as in previous climate stabilization tasks—people’s responses drive changes to an economy they are managing. In our task, people’s economic actions are not tied to an explicit environmental goal. Participants are not instructed to stabilize CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels, rather, their goal is to grow the economy such that it is at least doubled by the end of the task. However, the climate and economic systems in our task are linked such that increases in warming make it progressively more difficult to achieve economic growth. By providing people with an explicit economic goal, our task incorporates, in a novel way, a tension between achieving economic growth on the one hand, and managing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions on the other.
