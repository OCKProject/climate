 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] introduced a 
 <italic class="italic">climate stabilization task</italic> intended to assess how people reason about accumulation dynamics applicable to climate change mitigation. People were shown graphs illustrating the stabilization of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (the stock) at some time in the future. People were also shown a graph of the recent history of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (the inflow) along with the current rate at which CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was removed from the atmosphere (the outflow). The task was to sketch trajectories of emissions and passive CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> removal—the latter could effectively be assumed to be constant—that would achieve stabilization of the stock illustrated in the first graph. The results of this task showed that people frequently failed to identify that stabilization of the stock could only be achieved when the rate of inflow (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions) matched the rate of outflow (passive removal of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). Instead, people’s projected emissions rates consistently exceeded the rate at which CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was removed, highlighting a failure to understand the fundamental accumulation dynamics that drive global warming.
