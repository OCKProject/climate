<p class="p">It is now well established that people often have difficulty controlling and accurately predicting the behavior of systems that are defined by accumulation dynamics[

 <xref rid="pone.0184480.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In these systems, the quantity of a stock is affected by inflows and outflows to the system, respectively increasing and decreasing the quantity of stock. As noted repeatedly by Sterman and colleagues, accumulation dynamics of this kind are central to understanding climate change mitigation, as accumulated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can be viewed as a stock affected by inflows (i.e., anthropogenic CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions), as well as outflows (i.e., natural carbon sinks, such as forests and oceans). Because warming is driven by the accumulation of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions (i.e., whenever the rate of inflow is greater than the rate of outflow), it follows that climate change mitigation hinges, minimally, on stabilization of the stock of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>.
