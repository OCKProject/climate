While national and international research and assessments have explored the potential human health impacts of climate change, few assessments have explored the implications of climate change from a local public health perspective. An applied research approach to expand local knowledge and action of health vulnerabilities through a climate change action plan and vulnerability assessment was utilized by a local public health agency. Adoption and adaptation of the approach used may be valuable for public health organizations to assist their communities. Through completing a vulnerability assessment, an evidentiary base was generated for public health to inform adaptation actions to reduce negative health impacts and increase resiliency. Challenges in completing vulnerability assessments at the local level include the framing and scoping of health impacts and associated indicators, as well as access to internal expertise surrounding the analysis of data. While access to quantitative data may be limiting at the local level, qualitative data can enhance knowledge of local impacts, while also supporting the creation of key partnerships with community stakeholders which can ensure climate action continues beyond the scope of the vulnerability assessment.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>climate change</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd><kwd>public health</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>assessment</kwd><kwd>health impacts</kwd><kwd>climate change and health</kwd><kwd>adaptive capacity</kwd><kwd>climate models</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijerph-15-02237"><title>1.

Climate-sensitive health vulnerabilities, including issues of extreme temperatures, air quality, food- and water-borne illness and security, and vector-borne diseases exist across Canada [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Impacts due to climate change can be both direct (e.g., health effects of air pollution and temperature stress; increased range and transmission of infectious diseases; reduced access to safe water; injuries related to extreme weather events) and indirect (e.g., food insecurity; psychosocial impacts; population displacement) [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].

Identifying Climate Change as a Priority Public Health Issue</title><p>Public health units within Ontario must continually adapt to and address changing health needs within a community. As such, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) identified the ability to identify a priority public health issue which required a coordinated and comprehensive agency response as a key component of the 2012&#x02013;2016 strategic plan. Key factors such as support from the Medical Officer of Health and an internal recognition of climate change as an issue which spans all public health departments and programs provided the impetus for submitting climate change for consideration within the priority public health issue process.</p><p>As part of the selection process, a situational assessment was conducted which reviewed the local need to address climate change, through examining historical climate data, potential health impacts related to climate change, and current gaps within knowledge of climate-health risks. This situational assessment illustrated the expanding need to support the health of Simcoe Muskoka residents in the face of climate change. As such, in 2014, the SMDHU, with support of its Board of Health, identified climate change as the priority public health issue for the health unit.</p><p>Once selected as the priority issue for the agency, a Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) was developed to guide the actions taken and resources required to address health impacts from climate change within Simcoe Muskoka. The CCAP also identified the required governance support and dedicated resources to allow for long-term planning. The CCAP took a three-staged approach, including: Phase I&#x02014;Analysis of Current Environment; Phase II&#x02014;Health Promotion and Engagement; and Phase III&#x02014;the Integration of Climate Change into Health Unit Programming. Phase I involved the completion of a local climate change and health vulnerability assessment [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In conjunction with an impending provincial mandate to examine the health impacts of climate change, the impetus for plan development arose from a need to improve understanding of the intersection of climate change health impacts with the local health status and determinants of health, while also determining current and future climate change impacts within Simcoe Muskoka to support local mitigation and adaptation planning. The plan sought to inform agency practices and public health programming, as well as enhancing regional capacity in considering climate change health impacts.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot2-ijerph-15-02237"><title>1.2. Expanding Local Knowledge of Climate-Sensitive Health Vulnerabilities</title><p>Vulnerability to climate change within a public health context can be defined as the degree to which individuals or communities are prone to the health impacts of climate change [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Vulnerability assessments are mechanisms by which organizations can articulate current and projected impacts due to climate change. Specifically, climate change and health vulnerability assessments support increased understanding and identification of the impacts that a changing climate will have on the health of a population [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. They enhance adaptive capacity through the identification of, and informing decisions about, mitigative and adaptive measures to decrease health impacts [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Within the Simcoe Muskoka region, local environmental organizations had completed vulnerability assessments which identified projected environmental changes due to climate change [<xref rid="B33-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, a thorough examination of local health impacts due to climate-related environmental change was lacking. As an agency which utilizes evidence-informed decision making to support program planning and practice, this gap in health consideration in previous assessments further highlighted the need to complete a climate change and health vulnerability assessment as a critical first step for the SMDHU CCAP. The vulnerability assessment allowed SMDHU to explore and evaluate local available data on the health impacts of climate change and identify internal climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, including continuation or enhancement of program activities already in place. Further, the vulnerability assessment created a tool which provides information on vulnerable populations and expected climate-sensitive impacts that can support community and municipal partners in evidence-informed decision making for their climate change mitigation and adaption planning processes.</p><p>As a priority of the CCAP, the purpose of completing a local climate change and health vulnerability assessment for Simcoe Muskoka was three-fold: (1) identify current and future climate-sensitive health outcomes; (2) determine populations vulnerable to climate-sensitive health outcomes; and (3) identify policies and actions to help mitigate impacts of climate change on health.</p></sec><sec id="sec1dot3-ijerph-15-02237"><title>1.3.

Research has shown that the presence of disease-carrying vectors such as ticks is dependent on factors such as climate, geography, the presence of other species (e.g., reservoir hosts) and available habitats for breeding [<xref rid="B71-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,<xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>].

To evaluate the presence of vector species, environmental surveillance is conducted. Passive surveillance for Lyme disease consists of submissions of ticks from individuals who have removed it from their (or another person&#x02019;s) body and are aware the health unit can facilitate the identification and testing of ticks. Passive surveillance has indicated an increase in both the number of ticks submitted, and the number of <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> (blacklegged ticks, the main carrier of Lyme disease) identified. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02237-f003">Figure 3</xref> shows the increase in tick submissions from 2007 to 2017. From these submissions, over 100 blacklegged ticks have been identified and of those, thirteen tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The incidence of Lyme disease in humans is currently low in Simcoe Muskoka, with fewer than five cases per year on average.

Identifying Current and Future Adaptive Capacity</title><p>Internal focus groups identified a variety of actions which currently support climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as vector-borne disease surveillance, heat notification systems, and community food security initiatives (see <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="ijerph-15-02237-box002">Box 2</xref> above for a sample of adaptive capacity measures identified within the assessment). Focus groups identified a varying level of understanding by staff of the connection of climate change to public health and the need to incorporate climate planning into public health practice. Program areas that are already engaging in work which could be considered climate adaptive (e.g., programs supporting food security, vector-borne disease, emergency management) had an increased understanding of the linkages of climate change to current programming implementation.</p><p>Key informant interviews uncovered variations in the level of understanding of the connection to climate change and health, readiness to act on climate change mitigation and adaption, and the level of engagement throughout organizations on climate preparedness.</p><p>An additional result of the stakeholder engagement process was the creation of collaborations with community and municipal partners. Snowball sampling aided the formation of key partnerships with individuals and organizations not yet connected to the health unit in a climate change capacity.

Challenges and Lessons Learned</title><sec id="sec4dot1dot1-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.1.1. Framing the Assessment</title><p>Despite the support of external experts, a lack of a guidelines specific to the Ontario public health perspective was observed. While multiple vulnerability assessment guidelines existed [<xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], the availability of a context-appropriate vulnerability assessment guideline could have facilitated framework identification and assessment scope. For example, while available international guidelines identified the steps and processes for completing a vulnerability assessment, the Ontario specific guideline, released after the commencement of the SMDHU assessment, highlights indicators, relevant data sources, and adaptation considerations specific to the Ontario context [<xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Access to these indicators at the beginning of the assessment process would have supported a more systematic approach of evaluating local impacts and needs. However, by creating a framework for the local vulnerability assessment through amalgamating key strategies and actions from various vulnerability guidelines, the SMDHU assessment framework was individualized to local adaptation and mitigation needs, while also considering internal resourcing capacity.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot1dot2-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.1.2. Scoping the Assessment</title><p>Due to the complex nature of climate change and its associated health impacts, the involvement of an agency-wide steering committee was critical for assessment completion. Inclusion of various disciplines on the steering committee supported cross-disciplinary collaboration [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and allowed climate change to be transformed from an issue of environmental health within the agency to an issue of broader public health programming and community impact. As the completion of vulnerability assessments was not mandated at the time of the SMDHU assessment, support from senior management and the Medical Officer of Health were key in facilitating the assessment, and will be vital in supporting future action surrounding climate change [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Scoping the assessment provided challenges due to the geographic and demographic nature of the region. Due to the number of municipalities within the area (26), as well as the diversity of needs within each municipality (e.g., urban centers, rural farming communities, Northern tourism communities), scoping was required in order to ensure that the information examined was relevant for each community. Dividing diverse populations and geographies into discrete North and South boundaries provided the benefit of understanding the diversity of people, exposures, and health status in the population. Further, it ensured the assessment met the needs of the health unit and was reflective of the internal resourcing capacity to complete the assessment during the project timeframe.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot1dot3-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.1.3. Describing Current and Future Risks</title><p>In the context of current and projected climate exposures, describing the local context is challenging due to the limitations in data collection (e.g., only two air quality monitoring stations in the region), and the limitations of downscaling global climate change projections to describe local changes in climate such as temperature and precipitation [<xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B76-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. External experts were consulted to aid in understanding the complexity of climate change modelling and projections in the province of Ontario, which has helped to increase the reliability of climate change projections, build connections, and has led to opportunities for collaboration.</p><p>Despite increases in global climate change and public health research funding and activity [<xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], gaps remain in our understanding of the complex relationships between climate and health. Collaboration with research institutions and universities has been shown to be advantageous to support quantitative analysis, climate modeling and the development of vulnerability indices [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Due to the timing of the assessment and lack of existing partnerships with a research institution, the SDMHU vulnerability assessment was completed by internal staff. In addition, due to the rate of climate-related weather events and the size of the population within the health unit jurisdiction, some health impacts (e.g., those related to extreme weather events) were not able to be quantified. In some sectors of the vulnerability assessment, a lack of supporting research, resources and internal expertise was highlighted as a barrier to determining health projections (e.g., risk relationships and health data relating to UV exposure). The links between climate and health outcomes are complex. They can work through direct and indirect pathways and are subject to influence from other factors, including demographics [<xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,<xref rid="B78-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Modelling the potential health impacts of climate change therefore becomes a wicked problem, where complex connections make projections uncertain.</p><p>Additional challenges arose from a lack of research and understanding of local sensitivity to climate-sensitive health outcomes. There are technical and logistical challenges to conducting research on outcomes at the local level [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>], but research has shown that associations between climate and health outcomes can vary both between and within countries [<xref rid="B79-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,<xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>,<xref rid="B81-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Research exploring the link between climate and health is limited within a North American perspective, and specifically within the Canadian or Ontario context.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot1dot4-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.1.4. Identify Current and Future Adaptive Capacity</title><p>The integration of qualitative data collection in the vulnerability assessment process enhanced the ability to identify current and future adaptive capacity, both internally and among stakeholders. Similar to other vulnerability assessments [<xref rid="B82-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], the use of qualitative data analysis supported an enhanced knowledge of community vulnerabilities and current and future adaptive capacity needs and abilities. Qualitative research methods can also act as a conduit for the identification and initiation of key community and stakeholder partnerships [<xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As an autonomous board of health responsible for engaging with 26 independent municipalities, all at varying levels of readiness to engage in climate action, the connections gained through the key informant interviews have proven invaluable in creating partnerships to support community-level action.</p><p>In addition, the completion of the focus groups with internal staff provides the opportunity to clearly examine the vulnerabilities specific to communities [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and articulate within the assessment the breadth of work currently occurring in public health that supports adaptive capacity and enhances resiliency to climate change. While climate change can be seen as a novel aspect of public health programming and education [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], the identified actions currently in place in Simcoe and Muskoka illustrate the considerable scope of work already occurring in traditional public health programming to support climate action. This is exemplified through surveillance programs, health education and promotion activities, and other adaptive capacity measures such as warning systems and communications. Further analysis of adaptation needs and prioritization of adaptation initiatives will continue to support climate resiliency within the public health system and community as a whole.</p><p>The key informant interview process was unsuccessful in engaging local Indigenous organizations and communities due to time and resource constraints of the project.

As evaluating community needs utilizing a climate lens is an emerging area of public health practice, public health practitioners will need to develop the skills necessary to analyze and communicate the impacts of climate change [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], a challenge which was experienced during this assessment. Communicating the results of the assessment, in addition to the process taken, challenges encountered, and lessons learned, has allowed for the strengthening of partnerships with other public health agencies, and the enhancement of public health capacity to address climate change across the province. Communicating the SMDHU vulnerability assessment experience to other local public health units can identify and mitigate key challenges, build capacity among public health professionals, and act as a framework for other public health units to learn about their own local climate context.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4dot2-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.2. Vulnerability Assessments in the Context of Climate Change Action Plans</title><p>The climate change and health vulnerability assessment conducted by the health unit was a key first step in supporting the agency CCAP. Public health departments have a key role to play in educating policy makers on the relationship between climate change, health, and public policy [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Completing the CCAP afforded the ability to clearly articulate the strategy and goals of the health unit. Additionally, while communicating the impacts of climate change was indicated as an action to be completed by public health units in the Ontario public health standards, the need to complete a vulnerability assessment was not explicitly indicated at the onset of the project. Integrating the vulnerability assessment as an outcome of the larger CCAP ensured that support for enhanced human resources would be maintained by the health unit throughout the entire length of the project.</p><p>In addition, the identification of the CCAP and associated vulnerability assessment established our commitment as an agency to engage in climate action beyond the scope of the vulnerability assessment. With climate change previously primarily considered an environmental issue, the creation of action plans and vulnerability assessments provides the relevancy that public health needs to be engaged with municipalities and community organizations around the climate change table [<xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Having the scope, goals and expectations of the larger CCAP identified supports clarification of roles and management of expectations of community partners and stakeholders [<xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and ensures that public health transforms from a source of health information to a partner in the community climate action process.</p></sec><sec id="sec4dot3-ijerph-15-02237"><title>4.3. Next Steps</title><p>Results of the vulnerability assessment will be employed to support adaptation planning throughout the agency.

The reorientation of public health to include a climate change lens into daily practice will ensure climate change adaptation is considered during program planning for teams with relevant programmatic connections to climate change (e.g., chronic disease prevention and food security) and in the context of vulnerable populations (e.g., child health and determinants of health) [<xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>In addition to internal adaptation planning, results of the vulnerability assessment will be leveraged to support stakeholder engagement and the integration of health adaptation policies among local municipalities.

The vulnerability assessment will support the health unit in giving a voice to the health impacts of climate change locally [<xref rid="B84-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], and provide the evidentiary base for mitigation and adaptation strategies that decrease local climate-related health burdens.</p><p>Finally, a timeframe for a reanalysis of the vulnerability assessment will be determined based on changing demographic and community health needs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-15-02237"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The completion of a local climate change and health vulnerability assessment supported the identification of the local vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change. It highlighted the many activities related to climate mitigation and adaptation already occurring within public health that enhance individual and community resiliency. In addition, the assessment highlighted gaps in ability to understand the local impacts of global climate change. The applied research approach to expand local knowledge of health vulnerabilities proved valuable for public health as the evidentiary base to inform adaptation actions and program activities to reduce negative health impacts and increase resiliency. Indirect benefits of the vulnerability assessment included interdepartmental collaboration, a shifting of the paradigm away from climate change as an environmental issue to one of broader public health importance, and the opportunity to engage with community partners and stakeholders to support health adaptation across a broad range of sectors.
