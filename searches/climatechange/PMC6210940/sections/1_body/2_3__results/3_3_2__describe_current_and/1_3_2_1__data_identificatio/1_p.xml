<p class="p">The vulnerability assessment drew on a combination of data collected by the health unit (e.g., mosquito surveillance), data routinely accessed by the health unit (e.g., census and hospitalization data) and novel data sources (e.g., climate change projections). Climate change projection data was obtained through the Ontario Climate Change Projections data portal (OCCP) hosted by York University in Ontario, Canada and supported by the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change [
