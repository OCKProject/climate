 <p class="p">As a case study to illustrate the justification, burden, significance and directions identified for specific climate-sensitive health vulnerabilities, this box summarizes the information on Lyme disease presented in the SMDHU vulnerability assessment [

 <p class="p">Vector-borne disease was identified as a priority climate-sensitive health outcome through consultation with internal and external stakeholders, as well as a review of national and international literature. Research has shown that the presence of disease-carrying vectors such as ticks is dependent on factors such as climate, geography, the presence of other species (e.g., reservoir hosts) and available habitats for breeding [

  <xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. As the climate of Ontario changes, the distribution of habitats suitable for the proliferation of vectors, such as ticks, and the diseases that impact on human health are expected to change [

 <p class="p">Lyme disease is a disease of public health significance within the province of Ontario. To evaluate the presence of vector species, environmental surveillance is conducted. Passive surveillance for Lyme disease consists of submissions of ticks from individuals who have removed it from their (or another personâ€™s) body and are aware the health unit can facilitate the identification and testing of ticks. Passive surveillance has indicated an increase in both the number of ticks submitted, and the number of 
  <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic> (blacklegged ticks, the main carrier of Lyme disease) identified. 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02237-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> shows the increase in tick submissions from 2007 to 2017. From these submissions, over 100 blacklegged ticks have been identified and of those, thirteen tested positive for the bacteria that causes Lyme disease. The incidence of Lyme disease in humans is currently low in Simcoe Muskoka, with fewer than five cases per year on average. Provincially, the incidence rate of Lyme disease shows an increasing trend from 2000 to 2016 [
  <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>].

 <p class="p">Research has shown clear links between climate and the distribution of Lyme disease and 
  <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic> [
  <xref rid="B75-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Research suggests that the geographic range of climate-sensitive disease vectors may spread by as much as 55 km per year [
  <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], and that by 2020, there is a strong likelihood of pervasive 
  <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> establishment within the health unit region [
  <xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>].
 </p>
 <p class="p">Enhanced tick surveillance was identified as an adaptive capacity action for consideration, which provided supporting rationale and evidence to conduct active tick surveillance. Active surveillance for Lyme disease assists in determining the presence and abundance of 
  <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic> (blacklegged ticks), the primary vector associated with Lyme disease transmission, by collecting ticks from their natural habitat through tick dragging. The objective of active tick surveillance is to track the expansion of the habitat of blacklegged ticks and the prevalence of 
  <italic class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>. Active tick surveillance was implemented with the support of provincial and municipal partners in several areas of potential tick habitat in Simcoe Muskoka.
