<p class="p">Internal focus groups identified a variety of actions which currently support climate change mitigation and adaptation, such as vector-borne disease surveillance, heat notification systems, and community food security initiatives (see 
 <xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="ijerph-15-02237-box002" class="xref">Box 2</xref> above for a sample of adaptive capacity measures identified within the assessment). Focus groups identified a varying level of understanding by staff of the connection of climate change to public health and the need to incorporate climate planning into public health practice. Program areas that are already engaging in work which could be considered climate adaptive (e.g., programs supporting food security, vector-borne disease, emergency management) had an increased understanding of the linkages of climate change to current programming implementation.
