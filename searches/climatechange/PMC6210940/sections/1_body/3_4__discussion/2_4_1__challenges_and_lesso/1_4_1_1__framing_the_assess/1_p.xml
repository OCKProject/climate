<p class="p">Despite the support of external experts, a lack of a guidelines specific to the Ontario public health perspective was observed. While multiple vulnerability assessment guidelines existed [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], the availability of a context-appropriate vulnerability assessment guideline could have facilitated framework identification and assessment scope. For example, while available international guidelines identified the steps and processes for completing a vulnerability assessment, the Ontario specific guideline, released after the commencement of the SMDHU assessment, highlights indicators, relevant data sources, and adaptation considerations specific to the Ontario context [

Access to these indicators at the beginning of the assessment process would have supported a more systematic approach of evaluating local impacts and needs. However, by creating a framework for the local vulnerability assessment through amalgamating key strategies and actions from various vulnerability guidelines, the SMDHU assessment framework was individualized to local adaptation and mitigation needs, while also considering internal resourcing capacity.
