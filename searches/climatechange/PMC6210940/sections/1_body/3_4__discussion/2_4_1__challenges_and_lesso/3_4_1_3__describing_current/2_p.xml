 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], gaps remain in our understanding of the complex relationships between climate and health. Collaboration with research institutions and universities has been shown to be advantageous to support quantitative analysis, climate modeling and the development of vulnerability indices [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Due to the timing of the assessment and lack of existing partnerships with a research institution, the SDMHU vulnerability assessment was completed by internal staff. In addition, due to the rate of climate-related weather events and the size of the population within the health unit jurisdiction, some health impacts (e.g., those related to extreme weather events) were not able to be quantified. In some sectors of the vulnerability assessment, a lack of supporting research, resources and internal expertise was highlighted as a barrier to determining health projections (e.g., risk relationships and health data relating to UV exposure). The links between climate and health outcomes are complex. They can work through direct and indirect pathways and are subject to influence from other factors, including demographics [
