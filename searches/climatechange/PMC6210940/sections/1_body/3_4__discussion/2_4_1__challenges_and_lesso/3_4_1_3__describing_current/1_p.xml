<p class="p">In the context of current and projected climate exposures, describing the local context is challenging due to the limitations in data collection (e.g., only two air quality monitoring stations in the region), and the limitations of downscaling global climate change projections to describe local changes in climate such as temperature and precipitation [

External experts were consulted to aid in understanding the complexity of climate change modelling and projections in the province of Ontario, which has helped to increase the reliability of climate change projections, build connections, and has led to opportunities for collaboration.
