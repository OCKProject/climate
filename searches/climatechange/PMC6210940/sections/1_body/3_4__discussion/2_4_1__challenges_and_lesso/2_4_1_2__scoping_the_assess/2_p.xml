<p class="p">Scoping the assessment provided challenges due to the geographic and demographic nature of the region. Due to the number of municipalities within the area (26), as well as the diversity of needs within each municipality (e.g., urban centers, rural farming communities, Northern tourism communities), scoping was required in order to ensure that the information examined was relevant for each community. Dividing diverse populations and geographies into discrete North and South boundaries provided the benefit of understanding the diversity of people, exposures, and health status in the population. Further, it ensured the assessment met the needs of the health unit and was reflective of the internal resourcing capacity to complete the assessment during the project timeframe.</p>
