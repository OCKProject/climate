<p class="p">The climate change and health vulnerability assessment conducted by the health unit was a key first step in supporting the agency CCAP. Public health departments have a key role to play in educating policy makers on the relationship between climate change, health, and public policy [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Completing the CCAP afforded the ability to clearly articulate the strategy and goals of the health unit. Additionally, while communicating the impacts of climate change was indicated as an action to be completed by public health units in the Ontario public health standards, the need to complete a vulnerability assessment was not explicitly indicated at the onset of the project. Integrating the vulnerability assessment as an outcome of the larger CCAP ensured that support for enhanced human resources would be maintained by the health unit throughout the entire length of the project.
