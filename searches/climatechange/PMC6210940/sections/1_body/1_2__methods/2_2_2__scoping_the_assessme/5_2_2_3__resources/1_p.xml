<p class="p">Decisions in the development of the vulnerability assessment were supported through an internal climate change steering committee comprised of agency staff responsible for the planning and implementation of climate change programming and staff with program expertise. Senior management, including the Medical Officer of Health, were included to ensure that the direction of the Climate Change Action Plan and vulnerability assessment were cohesive with agency strategic directions and priorities. The completion of the vulnerability assessment required direct investment of human resource capacity (with the project team including managerial, epidemiological and health promotion inputs) to support data identification, analysis, and synthesis. In addition, all program areas were engaged throughout the process to ensure a comprehensive reflection of climate change activities from an agency level. Specific program expertise for direction and interpretation was drawn upon from the social determinants of health, chronic disease prevention, communicable disease control, environmental health, and child health programs. These programs are all involved in community engagement and program delivery with activities and clients that intersect with climate change vulnerabilities.</p>
