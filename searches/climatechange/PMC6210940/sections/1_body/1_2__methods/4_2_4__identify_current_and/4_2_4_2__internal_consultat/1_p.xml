<p class="p">Internal stakeholders were engaged to gain insight into current health unit actions which support climate change mitigation and adaptation and avenues for program enhancement to support climate action. Focus groups were used to: (1) identify potential actions/collaborations with community partners related to climate change mitigation and adaptation; (2) identify the current knowledge of staff regarding the connections between climate change and health; and (3) identify key areas for future climate action within existing health unit programs. Twenty-two focus groups were held with health unit staff, including program teams, management, Medical Officers of Health, and the Board of Health. Focus groups were facilitated through staff meetings. During the focus groups, responses were manually recorded by the primary researcher, as well as a secondary recorder.</p>
