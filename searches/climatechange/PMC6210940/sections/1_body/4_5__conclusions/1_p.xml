<p class="p">The completion of a local climate change and health vulnerability assessment supported the identification of the local vulnerability and adaptive capacity to climate change. It highlighted the many activities related to climate mitigation and adaptation already occurring within public health that enhance individual and community resiliency. In addition, the assessment highlighted gaps in ability to understand the local impacts of global climate change. The applied research approach to expand local knowledge of health vulnerabilities proved valuable for public health as the evidentiary base to inform adaptation actions and program activities to reduce negative health impacts and increase resiliency. Indirect benefits of the vulnerability assessment included interdepartmental collaboration, a shifting of the paradigm away from climate change as an environmental issue to one of broader public health importance, and the opportunity to engage with community partners and stakeholders to support health adaptation across a broad range of sectors. The completion of climate change and health vulnerability assessments by Ontario public health units are important both in meeting provincial mandates and toward building an understanding of the strengths and challenges that impact local populations. Understanding local data and building partnerships with local organizations can assist in the facilitation of the creation of local policies to protect both human and environmental health.</p>
