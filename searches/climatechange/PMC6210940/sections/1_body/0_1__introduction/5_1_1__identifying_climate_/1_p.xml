<p class="p">Public health units within Ontario must continually adapt to and address changing health needs within a community. As such, the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit (SMDHU) identified the ability to identify a priority public health issue which required a coordinated and comprehensive agency response as a key component of the 2012â€“2016 strategic plan. Key factors such as support from the Medical Officer of Health and an internal recognition of climate change as an issue which spans all public health departments and programs provided the impetus for submitting climate change for consideration within the priority public health issue process.</p>
