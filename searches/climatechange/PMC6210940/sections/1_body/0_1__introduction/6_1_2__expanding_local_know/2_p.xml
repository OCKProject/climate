 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02237" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, a thorough examination of local health impacts due to climate-related environmental change was lacking. As an agency which utilizes evidence-informed decision making to support program planning and practice, this gap in health consideration in previous assessments further highlighted the need to complete a climate change and health vulnerability assessment as a critical first step for the SMDHU CCAP. The vulnerability assessment allowed SMDHU to explore and evaluate local available data on the health impacts of climate change and identify internal climate change mitigation and adaptation actions, including continuation or enhancement of program activities already in place. Further, the vulnerability assessment created a tool which provides information on vulnerable populations and expected climate-sensitive impacts that can support community and municipal partners in evidence-informed decision making for their climate change mitigation and adaption planning processes.
