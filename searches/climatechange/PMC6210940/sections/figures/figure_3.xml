  <p class="p">Ticks submitted to the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit and locally acquired ticks positive for Lyme disease, 2007â€“2017. Data Sources: Passive tick surveillance spreadsheet, extracted 8 May 2018. Interpretive note (1): Changes in tick submission rates are not necessarily indicative of an increase in local tick populations, and may be a result of other factors such as heightened public awareness. Interpretive note (2): Submitted ticks may originate from any location that the submitter has traveled in recent days, and not necessarily from within Simcoe Muskoka. It is estimated that two thirds of ticks submitted are acquired in Simcoe Muskoka.</p>
