<p class="p">Dengue is the most widely distributed and rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>. This acute febrile disease affects all age groups 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-WHO2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[2]</xref>, and is caused by four antigenically distinct but genetically related viruses (serotypes) 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Wearing1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>. Dengue has become endemic in over 100 countries in Africa, the Americas, the Eastern Mediterranean, South-east Asia and the Western Pacific 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref>. Approximately 2.5 billion people are at risk from dengue transmission. About 50 million new dengue infections 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-WHO1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[1]</xref> and at least 12,000 deaths, mainly among children, occur worldwide every year 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-WHO3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[4]</xref>. The economic burden of dengue has been estimated at approximately 2.1 billion US dollars per annum in Latin America and the Caribbean alone 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Shepard1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[5]</xref>. In some regions, such as the Americas, the economic losses caused by dengue are similar to those attributed to malaria and tuberculosis 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Torres1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[6]</xref>. As there are no specific antiviral medicines treating or vaccines preventing dengue, the only way to manage the disease is through the control of vector populations
