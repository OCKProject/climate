<p class="p">This paper estimates the relative effects of weather (minimum and maximum temperature, and precipitation) on dengue accounting for a range of non-climatic factors (e.g. access to piped water, urbanisation, gross domestic product, and long-term trends and seasonality; see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2" class="xref">Methods</xref>). Our model parameters are then used to project the potential effects of climate change on dengue incidence by 2030, 2050 and 2080 under three emission scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1) described by Nakicenovic and Swart
