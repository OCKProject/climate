<p class="p">Also of interest is the significant association between dengue incidence and the proportion of the population with access to piped water. This finding is at odds with previous observations suggesting that piped water supply was protective 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Schmidt1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[15]</xref>. Schmidt and colleagues suggested that dengue risk was higher in people without access to piped water supply because of the need to store water, and mosquitoes could then breed in this stored water. However, paradoxically they showed that people using rainwater harvesting had the lowest adjusted risk, and one would expect these people to store most water. It may be that in Mexico people reliant on piped water have intermittent water delivery making water storage necessary, hence providing mosquito breeding sites. The relationship between water supply and dengue risk is not simple and may differ from one locality to another.
