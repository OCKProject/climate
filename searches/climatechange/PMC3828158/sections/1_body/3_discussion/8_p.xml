<p class="p">Based on the number of cases reported each year in the dataset, this would equate to about 7,000 extra cases reported each year. However, actual excess disease burden will be greater than this value would suggest. Previous research has shown that for every official dengue report included in surveillance, there are 10—27 cases unreported

 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Clark1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[45]</xref>. Consequently, the real increase may be of the order of 70,000 to 189,000 extra cases per year. In addition, there may be many more asymptomatic infections. There is an even bigger concern in that this increase in infections, both symptomatic and asymptomatic may increase the incidence of the more severe forms of dengue. Previous research in the field has demonstrated that secondary infection with a new serotype increases the risk of severe dengue (see for example 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Wearing1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Fox1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[46]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Wichmann1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[47]</xref>). Therefore, if dengue incidence increases under climate change, the severe-dengue∶dengue ratio may potentially increase.
