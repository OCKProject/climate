<p class="p">Because the modulating effects of the climate system on vector populations do not immediately result in changes on dengue transmission, we specified meteorological variables within biologically and physically plausible time lags based on literature reports in Mexico (for example, references 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-ColnGonzlez1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-Brunkard1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0002503-HurtadoDaz1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>), and considering the delays in laboratory confirmation of suspected cases and their reporting. Optimal lags for the climatic variables comprised monthly average minimum temperature, average monthly maximum temperature and accumulated monthly precipitation lagged one and two months. Due to significant autocorrelation between the lags of these variables (Spearman's rank rho 0.7), we created new variables (Tmin
 <sub class="sub">1∶2</sub>, Tmax
 <sub class="sub">1∶2</sub>, and Precipitation
 <sub class="sub">1∶2</sub>) taking the mean of the values of the two optimal lags.
