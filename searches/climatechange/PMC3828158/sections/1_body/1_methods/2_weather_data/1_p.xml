<p class="p">We obtained the province-specific monthly mean values of minimum temperature, average maximum temperature and monthly accumulated precipitation from the Mexican National Meteorological Service for each province for the period 1971â€”2007. These monthly mean values were computed using province-specific observations from all available meteorological stations across Mexico. The network of meteorological stations from the National Meteorological Service consists of over 2,000 stations distributed across the whole country. The frequency and duration of rainy events were not considered as such information was not available from the National Meteorological Service. We preferred station data over satellite data because meteorological stations seem to provide more reliable information about the conditions (particularly rainfall) of an area than do satellites
