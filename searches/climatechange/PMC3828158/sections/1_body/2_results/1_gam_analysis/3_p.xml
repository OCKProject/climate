<p class="p">Higher incidence rates were observed during the wet season (May to October) compared to the rest of the year. We compared the model estimates with the observed data for the whole year, the wet and dry seasons. The model captured much of the spatiotemporal variability observed in dengue incidence (see

We tested the influence of the province with the greatest incidence rate on the model fit excluding it from the model. The results presented in this paper were robust to these changes.
