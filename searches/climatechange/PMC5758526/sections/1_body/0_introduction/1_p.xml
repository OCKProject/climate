<p id="Par2" class="p">The uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) dramatically changed the topography of Asia, and the direction of flow of the Yellow River system from west to east is closely tied to this uplift. The Yellow River appeared about 1.7 Ma during phase C of the Qingzang Movement

 </sup>. 1.2 Ma before present, there was substantial uplift of the Tibetan Plateau

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>, and tectonic movement of the Kunlun-Yellow River caused the Yellow River to cut the Jishi Gorge and flow into the Linxia-Lanzhou basin

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. At that time, the Yellow River basin was only composed of some disconnected lakes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. The uplift of the Tibetan Plateau and river erosion, especially during the Gonghe Movement (0.15 Ma) in the late Pleistocene, greatly promoted the connection of these lakes causing the retrogressive erosion of the Yellow River and downcutting of the river valley in Sanmen Gorge

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. Consequently, the Yellow River evolved into a long river flowing from west to east
