<p id="Par5" class="p">In this study, we sampled 45 populations along the Yellow River to infer the effects of geological events and climate change during the Pleistocene on two 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> species. To better understand the distribution of these two species, we evaluated the following: (1) the relationship between the divergence time of chlorotypes and the paleoclimate, formation, and evolution of the Yellow River; (2) the demographic history of two 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> species using genetic data and species distribution models.
