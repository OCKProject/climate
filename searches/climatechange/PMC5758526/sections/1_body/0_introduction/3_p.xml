 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> is naturally distributed in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, from Qinghai to the ravine region between Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces; 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic>, however, mainly occurs in the lower reaches of the Yellow River. The most obvious features of these species include drought, saline, and alkaline tolerance; they are also water tolerant. The small, short-lived seeds in particular require a moist surface soil, short-term precipitation, or may drift with water in the early stage of germination
