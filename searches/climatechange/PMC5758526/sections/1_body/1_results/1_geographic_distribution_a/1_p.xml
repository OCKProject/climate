<p id="Par6" class="p">Two cpDNA fragments from a total of 382 individuals and nDNA ITS fragments of 45 populations and two out-group individuals were sequenced. The total length of cpDNA sequences was 1640 bp, with 11 chlorotypes identified by nine nucleotide substitution sites and two indels. These 11 chlorotype sequences were submitted to the GenBank database under accession numbers KY621817-KY621842. Chlorotype C10 was unique to population GYJ. The Chlorotype C1 was shared by all of populations, which indicates high migration rates among populations. Interestingly, C2 was found in populations GLZ and SDH, in different species and at different geographical distance between the two populations. The details of chlorotype distribution for each locality are shown in Fig.Â
