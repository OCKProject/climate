<p id="Par7" class="p">Based on chlorotypes, we constructed a Median-joining network. One chlorotype (C1) was found in 363 of 382 individuals from the 45 populations and represented the central node of this network; the networks containing clades with characteristic star-like topologies showed that populations that have experienced population expansion. The aligned sequences of ITS in 45 populations were 686 bp; 56 ribotypes (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) were found among 363 individuals (a total of 726 alleles). Ribotypes R2, R8, R15, R11, R10, and R16 contained a large number of haplotypes; the sequence polymorphisms detected in cpDNA and ITS regions are shown in Supplementary Tables
