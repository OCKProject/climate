<p id="Par10" class="p">In the time-calibrated chlorotype tree (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), all chlorotypes diverged during the Pleistocene. The BEAST analyses placed the origin of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> at 1.85 Ma (95% HPD = 0.70–3.23), which was observed in the GYJ population in this study, suggesting that plants of the genus 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> first reached Gansu when migrating from a secondary differentiation center of Xinjiang. The divergence time of C5 (found in NMDK, NMWH, and NXYC) was 1.23 Ma (95% HPD = 0.45–2.13). Chlorotype C1 is the most widely distributed in the Yellow River basin, and its divergence was 0.19 Ma (95% HPD = 0–0.54), which is approximately consistent with the time of MIS 5e-6 and formation of the modern Yellow River, suggesting that climate fluctuations promoted the divergence of chlorotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic>.
