<p id="Par15" class="p">The model algorithm provided the best results based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values; AUC values for these curves varied from 0.941 to 0.971. For both species, the most suitable area climatically (0.54 &lt; P &lt; 1) from the current prediction (601,927 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was obviously larger than that from the last glacial maximum (LGM) prediction (564,288 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the last interglacial (LIG, 347,475 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) predictions; similar patterns were identified for all suitable areas (P &gt; 0.05) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,b and c</xref>). Obviously, climatically suitable areas from prediction expanded during the Quaternary period.
