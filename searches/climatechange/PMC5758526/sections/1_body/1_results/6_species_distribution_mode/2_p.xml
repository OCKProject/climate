<p id="Par16" class="p">Results from the analysis of variable contributions indicated that three environmental variables, namely, mean temperature of coldest quarter, isothermality, and precipitation of wettest month, were the main climatic factors affecting the current distribution of the two 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> species analyzed here; the percentages of their contributions were 26.8%, 16.7% and 16.4%, respectively. This finding showed that wet habitats and temperate zones were probably the main factors that limit the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> species over time when compared with the effects of other variables.
