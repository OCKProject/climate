<p id="Par13" class="p">The Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot (EBSP) of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> cpDNA indicated a continuous demographic expansion that began around 0.10 Ma (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), and the historical population trend inferred from ITS also showed that 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> experienced a long period of steady and sustainable growth in its populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). The EBSP of 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> cpDNA showed an initial period of stable size followed by an abrupt period of growth in effective population size (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>); this change of the effective population size of 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> was also observed in the ITS data sets (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>).
