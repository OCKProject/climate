<p id="Par12" class="p">The mismatch distributions of both cpDNA and nDNA revealed the occurrence of an expansion of the historical population (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Sum of squares deviations (SSD) tested the validity of a sudden expansion model based on the SSDs between the observed and expected mismatch. Non-significant values for SSDs indicated that the data did not deviate from that expected under the model of expansion. The raggedness index was calculated similarly, and insignificant raggedness values also indicated populations of both species experienced expansion.
