 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> have experienced recent demographic expansion based on cpDNA sequences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In general, the significantly negative Tajima’s D and Fu’s F values were interpreted as a signal of purifying selection or alternately as demographic expansion. The values of Tajima’s D and Fu’s F inferred from nDNA were negative but statistically insignificant.
