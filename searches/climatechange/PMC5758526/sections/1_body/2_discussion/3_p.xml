<p id="Par19" class="p">It is not easy to interpret why the expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> began around 0.02 Ma. 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> are morphologically similar, and both species flower from May to October. Previous studies showed that these two species are closely related phylogenetically

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>; therefore, we speculate perhaps 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> is a species that evolved and diverged from 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> along the Yellow River, which could explain why the species expanded relatively late. Overall, the valleys of the Yellow River are not only known as cradles of Chinaâ€™s ancient civilization but also provide moist habitat for seed germination and plant growth. Clearly, the Yellow River has been revealed to be the main driving force for demographic expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic>.
