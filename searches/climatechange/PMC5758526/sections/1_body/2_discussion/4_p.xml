<p id="Par20" class="p">These two species experienced demographic expansion during the late Pleistocene, which was a period of multiple glacial-interglacial cycles and dramatic environmental changes. Numerous studies have suggested that environmental changes associated with the Pleistocene climate (e.g., sea-level fluctuations) played roles in determining both the origin and distribution of living organisms
