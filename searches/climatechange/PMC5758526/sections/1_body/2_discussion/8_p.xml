<p id="Par24" class="p">Various researchers have experimentally investigated the effects of recent colonization events on genetic diversity in both herbs and birds. Recently, Dâ€™Andrea 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. studied the molecular biogeography of 
 <italic class="italic">Lactuca serriola</italic>. They found that significantly lower genetic diversity characterized the newly colonized parts of the range of this species when compared with historical populations; this confirmed the importance of founder effects

 </sup>. Similar results have been reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Geranium carolinianum</italic>; genetic diversity patterns across China have revealed that reduced diversity has resulted from successive founder events during range expansion

 <italic class="italic">Sturnus vulgaris</italic>) because multiple introductions associated with successful dispersal strategies may lead to relatively high genetic diversity, especially when introductions occurred from different regions
