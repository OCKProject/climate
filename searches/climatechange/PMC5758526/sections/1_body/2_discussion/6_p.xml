<p id="Par22" class="p">Unlike previous studies, we found that 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> experienced demographic expansion during the late Pleistocene. The EBSP analysis and predictions of paleo-distribution models under past climatic conditions consistently suggested that the populations of these two species not only survived but also experienced a period of range expansion. One interpretation of this is that 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> is a temperate deciduous species and shows a strong tolerance to cold and drought

 <italic class="italic">T. ramosissima</italic>,
