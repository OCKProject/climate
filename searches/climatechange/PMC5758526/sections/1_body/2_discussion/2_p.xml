<p id="Par18" class="p">The divergence time of C10 in the GYJ population was dated to 1.85 Ma. The paleo-magnetic dating of Liupanshan loess, near the GYJ population, showed the first grade Yellow River terraces reached to 1.8 Ma

 </sup>, and the divergence time of C5 (1.23 Ma) coincided with the Kunlun-Yellow River Tectonic Movement. Therefore, our data provide biological evidence for the approximate geological age of the Yellow River. Based on the divergence time of chlorotype C1 (0.19 Ma), the demographic histories of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> could be traced back to 0.15 Ma and 0.02 Ma, respectively. As mentioned earlier, the Gonghe Movement started from around 0.15 Ma, which resulted in a substantial uplift of the QTP and promoted the formation of modern Yellow River

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>; therefore, it appears that the expansion of these two species was closely matched to the formation of the modern Yellow River.
