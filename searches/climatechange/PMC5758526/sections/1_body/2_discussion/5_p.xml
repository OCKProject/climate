 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> are temperate species endemic to China; although this region was not directly affected by extensive ice sheets, it also experienced severe climatic change throughout the Quaternary. Also, during the LGM, the low thermal conditions in the Eurasian continent produced temperatures that were 4 °C–16 °C lower than today
