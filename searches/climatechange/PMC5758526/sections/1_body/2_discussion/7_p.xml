<p id="Par23" class="p">Our genetic data showed that the haplotype diversity value for the entire dataset averaged 0.11, while nucleotide diversity averaged 0.057 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>; meanwhile, Hd of the GLZ and NMDK sites were 0.56 and 0.60, respectively, and the populations from the lower reaches seemed to have lower values. Population genetic theory predicts that colonization can result in a decrease in genetic diversity, known as the founder effect, and there is a loss of diversity in newly established populations due to a small number of founders
