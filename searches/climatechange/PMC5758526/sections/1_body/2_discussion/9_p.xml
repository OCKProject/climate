<p id="Par25" class="p">Taken together, different introductions and dispersal strategies contributed different amounts of genetic diversity through the introduction of different numbers of individuals or individuals carrying different amounts of diversity. It is well known that genetic diversity is linked to adaptive potential

 </sup>; low genetic diversity in introduced populations may lower their abilities to adapt and hence increase the risk of extinction in novel environments. Thus, to maintain adaptive potential and minimize the risk of extinction, the founder populations with relatively high levels of genetic diversity need to be conserved.
