<p id="Par27" class="p">A total of 382 individuals were sampled from 45 populations including 147 individuals of 21 populations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 235 individuals in 24 populations of 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic>, during September 2015 to September 2016, across eight provinces along the Yellow River. Of these locations, SFY and SWS were located along the Fenhe River, the second largest tributary of the Yellow River. Additionally, in Shandong Province, 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> is common in alkaline and saline soil areas along the coasts of the Bohai Sea; as a result, the sample points here are denser geographically than those of other samples. Moreover, two individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">Myricaria bracteata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Myricaria paniculata</italic> were collected in Gansu and Qinghai, for use as outgroups in the analysis. Samples of fresh leaves were dried using silica gel; the location of each population, including longitude, latitude and elevation, were recorded with a GPS unit. TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> provides detailed information on the sample locations. The voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of the Ecological Laboratory of Henan Agricultural University (HEAC).
