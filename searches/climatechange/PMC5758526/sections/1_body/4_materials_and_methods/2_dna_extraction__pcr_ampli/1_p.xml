We carried out PCR amplification in 20 μL reaction volumes for each individual; PCR products were checked on 1.5% agarose gels and purified with the TaKaRa MiniBEST Agarose Gel DNA Extraction Kit (Dalian, China); all PCR products were subsequently sequenced on an ABI 3730 DNA Sequence Analyzer at the Beijing Genomics Institute (Beijing, China), sequencing with forward and reverse primers in all individuals.
