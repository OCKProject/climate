 </sup>. Two groups were defined based on 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> species, and three evolutionary scenarios were developed and tested: (a) scenario 1, in which 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> of size N1 and N2 have diverged t generations in the past from an ancestral population of size N1 + N2; (b) scenario 2, in which 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> derived from ancestral population at t2, 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> derived from 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> at t1; (c) scenario 3, in which 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> derived from ancestral population at t2, 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> derived from 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensi</italic> at t1. We generated 3, 000 000 simulated datasets per scenario and chose uniform prior distributions for effective population sizes. To confirm the validity of using ABC to analyze our data, a posterior probability of scenario was assessed and finally obtained the best-supported scenario for comparison.
