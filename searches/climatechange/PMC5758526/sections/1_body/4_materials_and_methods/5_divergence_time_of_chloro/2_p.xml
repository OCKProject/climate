 </sup>. We ran the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain for 10 million generations, with a sampling every 1,000 generations. We used Tracer software to visualize and check for convergence to a stationary distribution and for high effective sampling size values (ESSs &gt; 200); the first 10% of trees were discarded as burn-in in TreeAnnotator Version 2.3.2, and the resulting trees were drawn in FigTree Version 1.4.2.
