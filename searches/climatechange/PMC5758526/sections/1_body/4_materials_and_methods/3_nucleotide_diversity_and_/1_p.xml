<p id="Par29" class="p">Sequence contig was done using Seqman with the DNAstar program (DNAstar, Madison, WI, USA); all the variance sites were carefully checked optically in Chromas. For nDNA ITS sequences, if double peaks occurred in the same position and the weakest signal reached 1/3 of the strongest signal, we considered the site to be heterozygous, and inferred their phases using the PHASE algorithm in DnaSP 5.10

 </sup>. Haplotype diversity (Hd) and nucleotide diversity (Ï€) inferred from cpDNA sequences within populations were all done in DnaSP. The genealogical topologies of chlorotypes and ribotypes were constructed using the program Network Version 5.0 with a median-joining model.
