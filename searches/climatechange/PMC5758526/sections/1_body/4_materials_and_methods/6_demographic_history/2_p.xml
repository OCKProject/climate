 </sup> in BEAST 2.3.2. We applied a general time-reversible substitution model and strict clock rate 0.9×10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup>substitutions per site per year; the weights for EBSP operators and the initial value were adjusted to improve MCMC mixing. We used a scale factor of 0.5 for cpDNA because only the female cpDNA contributes to the effective population size, and then the MCMC chain was run for 10,000,000 iterations.
