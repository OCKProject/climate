<p id="Par26" class="p">The main goal of the present study was to understand how the two widespread East Asian temperate deciduous tree species, 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic>, responded to climatic fluctuations in the Pleistocene and prehistorical geological events affecting the Yellow River. Based on a wide geographic range of samples and by combining information on cpDNA and nDNA sequences, we dated the divergence time of chlorotypes to the Pleistocene and reconstructed the demographic expansion history of 
 <italic class="italic">T. austromongolica</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T. chinensis</italic> throughout the Yellow River valley based on EBSP, a distribution model, and ABC analyses. The results suggested that the populations of these two species experienced a period of range expansion. Additionally, the occurrence of the expansion of these two species was closely matched to the formation of the modern Yellow River.
