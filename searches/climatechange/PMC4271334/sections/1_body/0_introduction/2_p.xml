<p class="p">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing Pacific Island countries and territories (PICTs) due to their unique geophysical features and their social, economic and cultural characteristics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Life expectancies in the Pacific are generally low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>] and, in many countries, have not improved significantly over the last 20Â years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Most Pacific communities have a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases, and some also have a high burden from communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and dengue fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. These challenges are compounded by widely dispersed populations, limited resources and fragmented health systems, which are highly reliant on development funding.
