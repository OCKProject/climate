<p class="p">Adaptation activities involve putting in place measures that reduce the vulnerability of human or natural systems to climate change impacts [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. To provide an example, the changing climate may result in an increase in the incidence of dengue [

Adaptations may include strengthening the resilience and capacity of ministries of health and environment, as well as the general community, in routine vector control to minimise the presence of potential mosquito breeding sites, disease surveillance systems to detect dengue outbreaks, and response mechanisms to help ensure dengue outbreaks are promptly brought under control to minimise morbidity, mortality and health system strain.
