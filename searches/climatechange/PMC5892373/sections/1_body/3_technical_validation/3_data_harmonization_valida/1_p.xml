<p class="p">The R code to restructure, and harmonize the data, as well as the original data files are included in the folders called ‘Code_toclean’ and ‘input_data’ in Data Citation 1. All of the code was written by T. Leach and reviewed by L. Winslow. A series of manual QA/QC steps were performed to verify that there were no data processing errors between the raw source files and final data tables. A random 1% of each data type was manually checked between the original and final data files. All physical data including temperature and dissolved oxygen profiles and Secchi disk depths were manually checked for out of range or unexpected values. Out of range values were corrected or removed where appropriate. The database and R code were revised as needed throughout these manual validation steps to correct mistakes.</p>
