<p class="p">QA/QC procedures for all samples counted at the ANS included recounts of specific samples and consultation with outside experts for verification of taxonomy. Outside experts included Dr Ann St. Amand (PhytoTech, St. Joseph, Michigan, USA), Dr Rex. L. Lowe (Bowling Green State University, Bowling Green, Ohio, USA) and William R. Cody (Aquatic Taxonomy Specialists, Malinta, Ohio, USA). Dr Ann St. Amand also verified taxonomy of samples counted at the University of Louisville. Also, images were taken of most taxa to help insure consistency of identifications from the beginning to the end of the project, especially for undescribed taxa.</p>
