<p class="p">To ensure consistent species identification of the zooplankton, photographs were taken for both rotifers and crustaceans. When possible, microscope slides were created for crustaceans showing important anatomic criteria. Calanoid and cyclopoid species identifications were verified with prepared slide mounts of antenna and 5th leg preparations of both males and females when possible. When congeneric species or multiple species of 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia</italic> were present, slides of 25 randomly selected individuals were prepared to estimate the relative proportions of each congener and compared to proportions within full counts. Identification of reoccurring but rare rotifer species were verified by Dr Richard Stemberger (Dartmouth College, Hanover, NH). For all zooplankton samples the subsample-to-sample ratio was maximized in order to limit multiplication errors and improve accuracy of counts. Duplicates counts were performed on samples from every tenth lake during the 1994–1996 and 2001–2002 sampling periods. These duplicate counts showed that counting precision was high.
