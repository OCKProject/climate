<p class="p">A QA/QC program for the AEAP chlorophyll 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and nutrient samples consisted of running a certified external standards every 10th sample, spikes in 10% of samples to verify analyte recovery and replication of sample analysis for 10% of samples. Standard curves were run at the beginning and end of every analyte analysis batch (20 samples) as well as a blank and standard in the middle of each run to assess drift and develop the standard curve. If the value of these standards was not within 10% of expected the entire batch was re-analyzed. The Keck Laboratory where the AEAP samples were analyzed was Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Program and National Environmental Laboratory Accreditation Conference certified and participated in the USGS Standard Water Sample Program administered by the Environment Canada, National Water Research Institute Ecosystem Inter-laboratory Quality Assurance Program. As part of this program, proficiency samples were analyzed every six months to assure quality control and the laboratory was audited every two years.
