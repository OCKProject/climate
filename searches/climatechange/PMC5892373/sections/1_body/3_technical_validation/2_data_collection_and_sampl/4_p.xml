<p class="p">The water chemistry data collected as part of the ALTM sampling program also had a QA/QC program in place to assure data quality and measurement accuracy. This procedure included a clear line of sample custody, standard maximum holding times and assessment of analytical precision. To assess analytical precision, 5% of all samples were collected and analyzed in triplicate. On days when field triplicates were collected the values in the dataset represent the average of those triplicates. Laboratory duplicates (i.e., samples split in the laboratory from the same field collection container) were analyzed every 20th sample. Field blanks were also created for at least 5% of the total field samples. Field blanks were prepared in the laboratory by filling collection containers with deionized water and then processing them in the field as though they were field samples. Analytical standards were run at the beginning of a batch and every tenth sample. Only field samples bracketed by passing standards were accepted. Correction actions such as recalibration and sample re-runs were performed if coefficient of variation between laboratory duplicates or standards was greater than 0.1.</p>
