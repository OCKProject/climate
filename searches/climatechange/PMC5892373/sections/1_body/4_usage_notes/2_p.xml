<p class="p">We have developed two methods for data access. One, the CSV files of all data can be downloaded directly from an online repository (Data Citation 1). This supports general use cases, as CSV is a common and widely supported data format. Two, we have developed an R package wrapper for the dataset that is available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This package 
 <italic class="italic">adklakedata</italic> automates the downloading, local storage, and access of the data. Data are accessed using the ‘
 <italic class="italic">adk_data</italic>’ function which accepts a parameter for each dataset (e.g., `
 <italic class="italic">adk_data(‘tempdo’)</italic>’ for temp and dissolved oxygen data).
