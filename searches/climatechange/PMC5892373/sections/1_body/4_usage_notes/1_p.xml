<p class="p">The combined dataset is distributed as a series of comma separated value (CSV) files that contain the data organized by data type (See 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref> for description of each data type). Despite being separate files, all data can be linked by geographic location (site) using ‘lake.name’ or ‘PERMANENT_ID’ (from the NHD), or on a temporal axis using the ‘date’ variable. Keep in mind that not all chemical, physical and/or biological data were collected on the same day so a matching window (for example±7 days) may be useful to employ when merging different data types for analysis.
