<p class="p">Replicate zooplankton samples were collected in the deepest part of each lake from surface to 1 m above the bottom or to the depth where DO was&lt;2 mg/L, whichever was shallower, using a hose-integration technique and constant-flow pump. The hose was lowered through the water column at a constant rate and at least 100 L were pumped from each lake (150–200 L for lakes identified as having low zooplankton densities) and concentrated with a 64- μm mesh. Zooplankton were narcotized with carbonated water and immediately preserved in the field with buffered formaldehyde.</p>
