<p class="p">A single phytoplankton sample was collected in the deepest part of each lake from the surface down to the 1% PAR (estimated at twice the Secchi depth) with a 2.54-cm diameter integrated hose. For lakes shallower than the estimated 1% PAR depth, samples were collected from the surface to 1â€‰m above the bottom. This approach contrasts with the methodology used for nutrients and chlorophyll 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, which were collected as an integrated sample in the epilimnion. A 250-ml subsample of an integrated sample was preserved in the field with a 3% mixture of equal parts glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde for later enumeration and identification of species.
