<p class="p">Temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurements were taken at 1 m intervals throughout the entire water column in the deepest spot in each lake as part of the AEAP program. Temperature and DO were measured with a YSI Model 54 meter using a calibrated membrane electrode and thermistor (YSI, Yellow Springs, OH, USA). The thermocline depth was determined in the field as the depth at which the water temperature decreased≥2 
 <bold class="bold">°</bold>C in a meter. The thermocline depth determined the depths of epilimnetic samples for other variables (e.g., phytoplankton abundance and taxonomy). Secchi disk depth was also measured on each sampling occasion.
