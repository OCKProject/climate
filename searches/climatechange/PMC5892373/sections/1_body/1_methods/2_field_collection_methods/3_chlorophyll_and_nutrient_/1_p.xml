<p class="p">Water samples to measure chlorophyll 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total filterable phosphorus (TFP), and molybdate reactive phosphorus (MRP) were collected at each study site coincident with the collection of the physical data (described above) and biological samples (see below). For sampling occasions when the water column was thermally stratified (as determined by the temperature profile) an integrated epilimnetic sample was collected with a 2.54-cm diameter hose. For un-stratified sampling events, a single integrated sample from the surface to 1â€‰m above the bottom was collected. Samples were stored in high-density amber polyethylene bottles and transported in chilled coolers to the Keck Laboratory at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy, NY for processing and analysis
