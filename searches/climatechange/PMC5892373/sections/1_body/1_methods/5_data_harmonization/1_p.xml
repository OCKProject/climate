<p class="p">We harmonized the different data sources using a combination of lake names and latitude/ longitude records. We verified all lake names against the Geographical Names Information System database (

Further, to connect the dataset with a physical water body, we linked each site with its corresponding polygon in the high-resolution U.S. Geological Surveyâ€™s National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) and include corresponding polygons and permanent identifiers for future use. Sampling date formats and lake names were also standardized so that data files can be easily linked by lake and sampling occasion in addition to permanent identifiers. See
