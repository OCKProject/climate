<p class="p">Long-term meteorological data, including air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation, were extracted from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) from 1979â€“2012 using the geographic location of each lake. NLDAS is a gridded reanalysis of historic weather data over North America produced and maintained as a collaboration between NASA and NOAA (
