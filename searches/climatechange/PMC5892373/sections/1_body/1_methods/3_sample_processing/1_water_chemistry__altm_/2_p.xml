A Tekmar Dorhmann Pheonix 8000 carbon analyzer (Teledyne Tekmar, Mason, OH, USA) was used to measure concentrations of dissolved organic and inorganic carbon (DOC and DIC, respectively) by converting the carbon in the sample to carbon dioxide and measuring the carbon dioxide with an infrared spectroscopic sensor
