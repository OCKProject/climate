<p class="p">Aliquots of water samples were divided as necessary for the measurement of each analyte following standard methods outlined in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref> and briefly described here. Water color was determined on an unfiltered water sample by visual comparison to a platinum-cobalt standard. Conductivity, pH and ANC were measured electrometrically using a calibrated Orion or YSI glass electrode. Conductivity and pH where measured directly, with pH measured in the field immediately after collection, while ANC was measured using Gran titration
