<p class="p">Zooplankton biomass was estimated from the count data using published empirical length-weight relationships (crustacean zooplankton) or formulas for body volume calculations (rotifers) for the freshwater zooplankton species in the dataset or for congeners when necessary. For the rotifers, body volume formulas are from (refs
