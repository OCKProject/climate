<p class="p">Published length-weight relationships for the crustacean zooplankton typically incorporate dry weights of an individual. For consistency with rotifers and phytoplankton biomass estimates, we converted dry weights to wet weights by assuming that the ratio of dry:wet weight was 0.1(10%) following (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" class="xref">85</xref>). For the phytoplankton and some of the rotifer species, the estimates are expressed as volume (mm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> individual
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). For comparison with the crustacean zooplankton biomass, biovolume was converted to biomass by assuming that all organisms had a density of 1 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b85" class="xref">85</xref>); from this assumption organism volume as μm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> individual
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is equivalent to biomass as μg individual
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
