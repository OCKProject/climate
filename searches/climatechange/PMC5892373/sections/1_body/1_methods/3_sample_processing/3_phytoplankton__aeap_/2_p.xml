<p class="p">To determine biovolumes of algal taxa a simple geometric shape was matched to an individual cell, 1 to 3 dimensions of the cell were measured and these measurements were used to calculate the volume (in Î¼m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>). Fifteen specimens were measured for each taxon with additional measurements for larger and variably sized taxa. In several cases of rare taxa, fewer specimens were measured and/or sizes were determined from literature values.
