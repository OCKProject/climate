<p class="p">Phytoplankton samples from 1994 and 1995 were analyzed at the University of Louisville (Louisville, Kentucky, USA). All samples from 1996 or later were analyzed at the Patrick Center for Environmental Research at the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA) hereafter referred to as ANS. At the University of Louisville, samples were filtered onto a membrane filter, cleared and mounted under a coverslip on a microscope slide

 </sup>. One to three slides were prepared for each sample and 10–30 fields per slide were examined under 625x magnification. At ANS the samples were concentrated by centrifuge and examined under 538x magnification with an inverted microscope using Utermöhl sedimentation technique and counting random fields
