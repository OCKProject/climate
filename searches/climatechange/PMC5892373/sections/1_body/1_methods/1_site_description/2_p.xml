<p class="p">The lakes in this dataset were included in two independent long-term monitoring programs that were established to assess the effects of acid deposition in Adirondack lakes; the Adirondack Effects Assessment Program Aquatic Biota Study (hereafter referred to as AEAP) and the Adirondack Long Term Monitoring Program (hereafter referred to as ALTM). While both programs sampled more lakes than the 28 included in this dataset, these 28 lakes represent the overlap between the two separate programs and thus provide a comprehensive view of the long-term physical, chemical and biological characteristics of each lake. The data record starts in 1994 for all lakes and ends in 2006 for half of the lakes and in 2012 for the remaining half (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The physical, nutrient and biological data presented here were collected and analyzed by the AEAP. Additional water chemistry data were collected and analyzed as part of the on-going ALTM program. Because these monitoring programs were independent there is overlap in the measured water chemistry analytes. For analytes that were measured by both programs, we selected the data from a single program based upon completeness of record. Overlapping water chemistry measurements (i.e., those not selected from inclusion) can be found in the original data files (Data Citation 1; ‘data_inputs’) but not in the harmonized, final dataset presented here.
