<p class="p">The 28 lakes in this dataset are located in the southwestern portion of the Adirondack Park in New York, USA (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The hydrologic classification scheme used was developed by (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>) and is based upon a combination of hydrology (drainage or mounded seepage lakes), underlying geology (thickness of glacial till, or presence of calcite in the basin), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration (high or low), which combined characterize sensitivity to acidification of each lake. Of the 28 lakes, 20 are thin-till, drainage lakes, the class considered the most sensitive to acidification. Of these 20 thin-till drainage lakes, two have historically high DOC concentrations (TDH), while the remaining 18 have historically low DOC concentrations (TDL). There are six medium-till drainage lakes, two with historically high DOC concentrations (MDH) and four with historically low DOC concentrations (MDL). There is a single mounded seepage lake with historically low DOC (MSL) and one lake drains a watershed with deposits of carbonate (C), which eliminates sensitivity to acidification due to high ANC.
