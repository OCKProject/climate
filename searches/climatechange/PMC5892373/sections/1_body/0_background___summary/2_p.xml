 </sup>. Moreover, ecosystems can experience multiple, concurrent stressors. Understanding the effects of multiple, concurrent stressors is a critical need as disturbance regimes may interact to alter the trajectory of important biological and biogeochemical phenomena in complex ways. Regional and global-scale changes that occur simultaneously highlight the critical need for quality, long-term data on lake ecosystems that describe processes, interactions, and responses to multiple stressors. A number of existing long-term limnological datasets have been used to understand some aspects of long-term ecosystem change. For example, a recent analysis of eleven diverse lakes in the North Temperate Lakes (NTL) Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site has shown seasonal heterogeneity of water temperature warming in response to regional climate change

 </sup>. Such long-term datasets have formed the foundation of our modern understanding of limnological change. However, due to the many challenges associated with long-term data collections, the majority of long-term data sets focus on only a small number of lakes or response variables, but rarely both.
