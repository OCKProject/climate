 <p class="p">Long-term data collection is not possible without the help of countless students, technicians and volunteers. But in particular we would like to thank Scott Quinn, Bryan Weatherwax, Robert Bombard, and the New York State Police Aviation Unit without whose support the AEAP sampling effort would not have been possible. The AEAP program was funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA; contract #68D20171) from 1994â€“2006 and by New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA; contract #16298) since 2006. KCR acknowledges support of NYSERDA contract #115876 and National Science Foundation grant EF 1638704 for the development of this manuscript. The ALTM program was supported by NYSERDA, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Geological Survey and conducted by the Adirondack Lakes Survey Corporation (ALSC). Special thanks to Sara Burke, Michael Cantwell, Sue Capone, Pamela Hyde Corey, Korey Devins, James Dukett, Nathan Houck, Matthew Kelting, Monica Schmidt, and Philip Snyder of the ALSC staff. We would also like to thank Tobi Hahn for help with the R package creation. This paper has not been subjected to US EPA or NYSDEC peer and administrative review; therefore, the conclusions and opinions contained herein are solely those of the authors, and should not be construed to reflect the views of either agency.</p>
