<p class="p">In this study, we focus on the Chinese Maize Belt (CMB), which in 2012 contributed 78% of the total maize production in China and 18% of the global production

The goal of this study was to understand how the importance of water for maize yield has evolved with recent (from the 1980s to the 2000s) changes in variety and climate. The CMB (97.5°−135.1° E, 21.1°−53.6° N) covers a wide region of nearly 38 degrees of longitude and 33 degrees of latitude (

It also ranges from arid and semi-arid areas (annual precipitation &lt;320 mm) to humid and semi-humid areas (annual precipitation &gt;1000 mm). Because of the diversity of climates across the large range of latitudes, the CMB serves as an excellent laboratory for investigating the effects of varietal and climatic changes on the yield of both rainfed and irrigated maize.
