   <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). NE, NCP, and SW refer to Northeast China, the North China Plain, and Southwest China, respectively. Error bars indicate one standard deviation. We first made the standard module with ArcGIS 10.0 for the province level and then copied to the PowerPoint 2010. Then we made the individual map. Second, the maps in Fig. 1a–f were generated in PowerPoint 2010.
