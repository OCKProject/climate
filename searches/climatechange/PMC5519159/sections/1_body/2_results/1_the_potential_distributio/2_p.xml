<p class="p">In the case of passion fruit, current suitability was strongly correlated with elevation, with lowest suitability in the arid lowlands (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Both the Hedley and CCSM4 models suggested that suitability will decrease at intermediate elevations and in the highlands by 2050; however, the Hedley model showed considerably greater declines in island-wide suitability than the CCSM4 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). For the year 2070, both CCSM4 and Hedley models suggested an increase in areas of high suitability in the highlands, little change from current suitability in the lowlands (
