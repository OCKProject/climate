<p class="p">The AUC values in the SDMs for each species exceeded 0.89, indicating that models were ‘very good’ [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The standard deviation for current climate projection was 0.007 and 0.005 for guava and passion fruit, respectively. Suitability for guava under current climate conditions was lowest at low elevations, rising to highest at intermediate elevations before declining to moderate values at higher elevations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The Hedley scenario for 2050 predicted a strong increase in suitability in lowlands, a decline at intermediate elevations and an increase at the highest elevations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The CCSM4 scenario for 2050 predicted little change in areas of currently low suitability, but a strong decline in areas of currently highest suitability, shifting the mid and high elevations to a more homogeneous intermediate suitability. For 2070, both climate change scenarios predicted similar outcomes with island-wide increases in suitability, with both uplands and lowlands improving in quality (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Our quantitative assessment following methods of Thuiller et al. 2005, 2011 predicted gains in suitability in about 60% of Santa Cruz Island with no significant shrinking for 2070 (
