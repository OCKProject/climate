<p class="p">Guava trees were found in 21 out of 36 vegetation plots in LR and in four of 28 in CF. Passion fruit was recorded in 14 plots in LR and in just one plot in CF. The lower elevation limit were 148m and 90m, for guava and passion fruit, respectively, while the upper limits for each species exceeded our sampling range (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Occurrences of plants from both species in vegetation plots were always in areas of high predicted suitability under current climate conditions (Maxent suitability values &gt; 0.5 and &gt; 0.48 for guava and passion fruit, respectively; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181333.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). All vegetation plots with predicted suitability below this ‘survival limit’ did not contain any passion fruit and guava plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Furthermore, current habitat suitability was a strong predictor of plant occurrences for both guava (p &lt; 0.01) and passion fruit (p&lt;0.08). In both cases, a Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test did not detect significant differences between the logistic model and the observed data (guava Chi-squared = 14.09, df = 8, p-value = 0.08; passion fruit Chi-squared = 12.51, df = 8, p-value = 0.13).
