<p class="p">Guava seeds were found in 71 dung piles (44.7%) in LR and in 25 (39.7%) in CF, while passion fruit occurred in 67 dung piles in LR (42.14%) and in 12 (19.04%) in CF. Tortoises dispersed prodigious quantities of seeds from both plant species (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181333.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). A total of 138,529 guava seeds and 19,420 passion fruit seeds were recorded from 222 dung piles (guava: mean = 1,443.01 ± 2,056.81, maximum 8,726; passion fruit: mean 245.82 ± 510.92, maximum 3,721). Seeds in dung piles of both guava and passion fruit were distributed over considerably larger ranges of elevations and Maxent suitability values than were living plants (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Large numbers of dung piles found in areas below the current species survival limits contained seeds from both species (16.6% of all dung piles containing guava seeds and 13.1% containing passion fruit seeds). These dung piles and the seeds they contain are considered as wasted seed dispersal events. In the case of guava, some 10.6% of all seeds dispersed by tortoises were wasted. Under our assumption that Galapagos tortoise migratory behaviour remains unchanged (discussed below), in both future climate change scenarios (Hedley, CCSM4) our results suggested a decline in wasted dispersal to ca. 4% in 2050 and 2070 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0181333.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For passion fruit, ca. 30% of seeds dispersed were wasted under current climate conditions, which we predict will rise to &gt; 45% and &gt; 58% under the CCSM4 and Hedley scenarios respectively, before declining back to approximately current levels by 2070 (
