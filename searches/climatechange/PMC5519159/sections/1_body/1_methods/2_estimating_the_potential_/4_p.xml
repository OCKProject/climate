<p class="p">Maxent was also used to project current climate SDMs into anthropogenic future climate change scenarios (cf. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]). Of the various datasets available, we chose each of two scenarios for the years 2050 (He45bi50, cc45bi50) and 2070 (He45bi70, cc45bi70), based on projections of the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC [

Both assume socioeconomic development and environmental consciousness. Both Hadley and CCSM, as employed here, were created using a third generation Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) of 4.5, predicting a mean global temperature increase of 1.4°C for the period 2046–2065 and a 1.8°C for the period 2081–2100 [

DIVA-GIS was used for mapping the Maxent output, i.e. species’ potential distributions within our study area.
