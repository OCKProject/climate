This presence-only method operates with a machine-learning algorithm following the principle of maximum entropy. It makes predictions on a taxon’s potential geographic distribution taking environmental data from geo-referenced species records and random background data [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] Maxent is a widely used SDM tool and, when used correctly [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] often provides more robust results compared to other similar methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] although there may be different approaches in identifying habitat suitability gradients [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. For each species, an average of 100 global model replicates obtained via bootstrapping was generated under default settings with 10,000 random background points [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Background data was sampled randomly for each species across the study area, taking the records as a baseline and Maxent’s logistic format (ranging 0–1) was chosen for output. Thirty percent of all species records were each randomly set aside for model testing (while all others were used for training) by estimation of the AUC–that is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Following the classification of Swets [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] and Araújo [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], AUC values range between 0.5 for models with no predictive ability and 1.0 for models giving perfect predictions, and values &gt; 0.9 describing ‘very good’, &gt; 0.8 ‘good’, &gt; 0.7 ‘useable’
