<p class="p">To avoid multicollinearity of predictors in ecological space, which could influence the model quality [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], we reduced the number of bioclim predictors in each species to five (out of 19). For this purpose, before computing models, a preliminary Maxent analysis was run using all 19 variables and applying a jack-knifing approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. In this way, the most ‘stand-alone’ informative predictors were identified [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] which included the following predictors as suitable for modelling: for guava, bio4 (temperature seasonality), bio7 (temperature annual range), bio14 (precipitation of the driest month), bio16 (precipitation of the wettest quarter), bio18 (precipitation of the warmest quarter); for passion fruit, bio5 (maximum temperature of the warmest month), bio7, bio14, bio18, bio19 (precipitation of the coldest quarter).
