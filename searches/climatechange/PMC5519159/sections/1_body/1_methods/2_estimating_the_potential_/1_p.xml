<p class="p">We used correlative Species Distribution Models (SDMs) to estimate the current potential distributions of guava and passion fruit on Santa Cruz. We did so by applying a modelling approach in which both worldwide native and invasive presence records to assess the potential distributions of these species. Georeferenced species presence records were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF (

 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This was performed by removing locations with clearly erroneous coordinates, such as points occurring in seas or oceans, extreme elevations, and occurrences collected from herbariums. This resulted in a final dataset of 1,621 and 1,435 georeferenced presence records for guava and passion fruit respectively, ranging between 32° N– 40° S, and 155° W—180° E. We then modelled the global distribution of our plant species in their respective native and introduced range at this reduced spatial extent. To modelling current climate, we used 19 ‘bioclim’ predictors (
