<p class="p">We defined evidence for wasted seed dispersal in terms of the difference in the geographical distribution of living plants of each species compared with the distribution of seeds of these species in tortoise dung piles. If the elevation range of seeds in tortoise dung piles exceeded that of plants, we considered this as evidence that seeds are being delivered into sites in which they are unable to germinate and survive. Evidence for wasted seed dispersal was also inferred when dung piles containing seeds were found in areas outside the respective species’ ‘survival limits’, as revealed in the modelling process (see below).</p>
