<p class="p">We quantified the distribution of seeds in tortoise dung piles by collecting fresh dung piles on repeated linear surveys conducted on foot that traversed the elevation gradient within the range of each tortoise species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Dung samples were collected during three different time periods over five years (June 2009 to November 2009, July 2011 to May 2012 and April to September 2013). Surveys were repeated every one to four days by the same observers (SB, FC, DES). In an attempt to widely sample throughout the tortoise ranges and to also avoid visually biasing our sample (i.e. preferentially collecting piles containing many seeds), we collected the first dung pile encountered each time we crossed an elevation level in multiples of 50 m (i.e. 50 m, 100 m, 150 m). This approach made it unlikely that we collected more than one dung pile from the same individual. One-hundred and fifty-nine dung piles were collected in La Reserva (LR) and 63 in Cerro Fatal (CF). All dung piles were georeferenced and their elevation was obtained from an overlaid digital elevation model (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission,

The number of seeds of each species was counted for each dung pile by washing dung piles with rainwater and using standard soil sieves with a final mesh of 0.5 mm. Seeds from both guava and passion fruit passing through tortoise guts are mostly viable and tortoise ingestion does not seem to influence seed germination success [
