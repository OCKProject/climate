<p class="p">In 2010, we quantified the abundance of both guava and passion fruit plants along the elevation gradient within the range of each tortoise species from a sample of 64 × 50m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> plots. A series of four nested plots was placed 50m apart and perpendicular to the linear survey routes every 50m of elevation from 10–400m above sea level in LR and from 100 to 400 m above mean sea level in CF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0181333.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>). The presence and absence of guava and passion fruit was recorded. A total of 28 and 36 vegetation plots were sampled at sites CF and LR, respectively.
