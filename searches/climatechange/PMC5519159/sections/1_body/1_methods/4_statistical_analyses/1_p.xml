<p class="p">From a total of 222 dung piles, we recorded presence of guava and passion fruit in 96 and 79 dung piles, respectively. Guava was found in 25 vegetation plots while passion fruit was found in 15 plots. We used Binomial Generalized Linear Models (GLM) to predict the presence both of guava and passion fruit plants along the current climate suitability gradient obtained from our SDMs for each species. In order to determine whether these logistic models fit the observed data in our vegetation plots, we calculated Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test [

To determine if plant distribution differed significantly between current and future climatic conditions, we estimated the relative number of grid cells in which suitable habitat was lost and gained using the BIOMOD_RangeSize function [

We did so by summing up all grid cells in which current suitable habitat became unsuitable under future climatic conditions and by adding up all grid cells that are unsuitable under current climate conditions but become suitable under future climates. We conducted all analysis with R 3.2.0 [
