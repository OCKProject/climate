The coastal zone, characterized by salt-resistant plants on sandy beaches, lava and mangroves, is followed by the arid zone, dominated by xerophytic trees, shrubs and cacti on a mostly lava substrate. With increasing elevation comes the transition zone where soil and understory vegetation are more developed. The moist zone contains well-developed soil with vegetation characterized by an abundance of shrubs, herbs, ferns, and trees. Finally, the highland zone is dominated by ferns, sedges and grasses with few trees [
