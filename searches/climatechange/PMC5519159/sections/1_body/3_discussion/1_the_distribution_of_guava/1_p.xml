Field data on the distribution of guava occurred in areas of high climatic suitability predicted by our Maxent analysis, which was parameterized with global distribution data, indicating that guava has already reached most of its suitable range and is likely approaching equilibrium. However, this relationship was more ambiguous for passion fruit. The most important bioclimatic variables in restricting guava appear to be precipitation (bioclim 14 and bioclim 18) while for passion fruit it seems to be temperature (bioclim 5 and bioclim 7). By sampling vegetation plots and tortoise dung piles along altitudinal and species suitability gradients, we found that for both species seeds in tortoise dung piles have considerably greater geographic ranges at low elevations and low habitat suitability values than do plants. This supports our prediction that seeds of guava and passion fruit are being transported by tortoises into areas that are apparently unsuitable for germination and survival under current climate conditions, and are therefore examples of wasted seed dispersal (about 10% and 30% of all tortoise dispersed seeds of guava and passion fruit respectively). Model predictions of the potential distribution of both plants species indicated that presence is restricted to suitability values well above those at which seeds in dung piles were recorded. We observed that the maximum distance tortoises dispersed seeds into unsuitable area (i.e. dung piles collected at 28 and 47 m above sea level,
