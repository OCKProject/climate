<p class="p">Importantly, our analysis showed that the habitat suitability modelling methodology accurately predicted the current distribution of guava and of passion fruit, thus we were able to use two different climate change scenarios to predict the potential future distributions of guava and passion fruit in 2050 and 2070. Both climate change scenarios predicted considerable increases in habitat suitability for guava in both the lowlands and highlands of Santa Cruz. The predicted expansion into the lowlands is of particular importance, because this species is currently restricted to areas above 150m elevation with most of its distribution outside of the Galapagos National Park [

As suitable habitat creeps down the elevation gradient toward the coast over the coming years, tortoise seed dispersal will facilitate the spread of guava further into the park.
