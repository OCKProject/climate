<p class="p">We have assumed that under future climatic conditions Galapagos tortoises will continue their seasonal migrations. We feel that this is likely because, firstly, the capacity for migratory behaviour is heritable and strong selective pressure toward sedentary behaviour is necessary if migration rates are to decline [

Galapagos tortoise generation time (ca. 25 years) is too long to provide a mechanism for natural selection to occur over the time scale of anthropogenic climate change. Secondly, though future climate change is likely to reduce the strength of gradients in primary productivity along the elevation gradient by bringing wetter conditions to the lowlands, a gradient will nevertheless remain, and tortoises should continue to respond to the spatial and temporal variation in food quality and quantity (Yackulic et al.
