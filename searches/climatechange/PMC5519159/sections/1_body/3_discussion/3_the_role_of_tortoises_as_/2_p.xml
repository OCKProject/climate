<p class="p">Key to assessing the role of tortoises in promoting the spread of invasive species under climate change is not only the number of viable seeds dispersed, but the distances over which tortoises disperse seeds compared to other dispersal mechanisms, and how rapidly suitable habitat is expanding. Among other dispersal possibilities, small and medium ground finches are known to move viable seeds through mandibulation, but these finches are usually seed predators, while Galapagos mockingbirds can defecate viable seeds [

 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]) and natal dispersal distances are likely to be ≤ 100m (inferred from Sutherland et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]). Seed dispersal distances by birds are usually much smaller than their home range size, thus it is probable that these species are moving seeds over a few tens of meters.
