<p class="p">By 2070, the area of suitable habitat for guava in the tortoise reserve on Santa Cruz will have moved downslope by an average of ca. 1,500m, advancing at a rate of 27m per year. Generation times of guava are in the order of 5â€“8 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Taking the eight year generation time for guava near their limits of suitability, for trees to advance downslope at the same pace as the suitability front, seeds would need to be dispersed at least 218 m per generation time. Birds as seed vectors would be unable to accomplish this except potentially during rare long distance movement events. While rare long distance dispersal events may be critical for species spread and persistence [

 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>] they are by definition rare, and very few seeds would be deposited at the leading edge of suitability under bird dispersal. In contrast, Galapagos tortoises are already depositing millions of viable seeds every year along the advancing suitability front ready to take advantage of improving habitat quality under climate change, accelerating the spread of this species. The eradication of guava appears to be unfeasible under current management constrains [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and unfortunately will become even more difficult in the future as a combination of climate change and long distance dispersal by tortoises will drive this species deeper into the Galapagos National Park.
