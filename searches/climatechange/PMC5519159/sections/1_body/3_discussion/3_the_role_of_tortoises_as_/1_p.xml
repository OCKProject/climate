<p class="p">The combination of climate models with distribution data for plants and seeds allow us to predict that by 2070, &lt;4% of guava seed dispersal by tortoises will be wasted (compared to 10.6% currently) due to an expanding front of suitable habitat moving downslope. A reduction of ca. 6% in wasted dispersal from current levels does not appear to be hugely ecologically relevant, however if we assume that a tortoise defecates on average once per day (S. Blake, pers. obs), that each dung pile contains an average of 624 guava seeds (this study), and that there are 4000 tortoises in the Tortoise Reserve (Galapagos National Park records), this represents an average increase of 149,761 seeds per day (54.7 million seeds per year) falling into suitable habitat by 2070 compared to current levels. Thus tortoises are planting seeds over large swathes of the Santa Cruz lowlands ready to germinate and establish as soon as the expanding wave of suitable conditions arrives. Our analysis indicates that suitability values will also increase higher up the elevation gradient of Santa Cruz above the current range of tortoises (

Previous data indicate that tortoises do not currently migrate above the main road that bisects the Santa Cruz highlands at ca. 300â€“400m elevation. Furthermore, as conditions become wetter it is unlikely to drive tortoises further into the highlands because they should find greater food biomass at lower elevations than they do currently. The conservation implications of upslope invasion by guava and passion fruit are less severe than downward invasion because the highlands of Santa Cruz are already highly transformed habitats with high abundance of invasive species [
