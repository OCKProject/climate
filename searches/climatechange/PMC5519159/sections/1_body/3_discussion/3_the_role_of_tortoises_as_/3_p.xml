<p class="p">Introduced herbivores such as cattle are restricted to highland areas and are unlikely to contribute to the downslope spread of guava and passion fruit. Invasive goats, donkeys and pigs are also dispersers of these species and have the potential to move seeds over large areas, however their ranges and relatively rapid digesta retention times [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] suggest that they are unlikely to disperse seeds over large vertical ranges. Humans, who on Galapagos may consume large volumes of fruits from these species, are potential long distance dispersers [
