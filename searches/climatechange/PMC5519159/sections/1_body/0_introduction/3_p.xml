 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. On Santa Cruz Island tortoises disperse seeds from at least 64 plant species, of which 27 are introduced species. Some 20% of seeds ingested by tortoises are dispersed &gt; 1 km. Thus, long distance seed dispersal by tortoises is not a rare event and may confer considerable advantages for tortoise-dispersed plant species [
