<p class="p">Our aims were to (1) estimate current and future habitat suitability for guava and passion fruit based on the current climate and on future climate predictions for 2050 and 2070 (2) quantify rates of wasted dispersal by tortoises for these species and (3) assess the role of tortoises in promoting the spread of these species now and in the future, under the assumption, justified later in the paper, that tortoise migratory behaviour will continue over the temporal scale of our climate change predictions.</p>
