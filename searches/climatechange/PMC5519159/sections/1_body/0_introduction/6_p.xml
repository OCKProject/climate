<p class="p">Here we consider this possibility for two candidate species, 
 <italic class="italic">Psidium guajava</italic> L. and 
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora edulis</italic> Sims. 
 <italic class="italic">Psidium guajava</italic> (guava) is a small tree, which was introduced to Galapagos by local farmers in ca. 1910 for domestic use as a food source. It has spread rapidly in humid areas and is now naturalised on four islands [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Trees bear abundant small succulent drupes containing hundreds of seeds in a sugary pulp [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Passiflora edulis</italic> (passion fruit) was also brought to Galapagos as a domestic food source that quickly escaped and spread widely [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Passion fruit is an herbaceous climbing vine that also produces an abundance of seeds in a thick pulp, ideally suited to animal dispersal. Guava has been introduced around the world as both a cash crop and a smaller scale food source [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Similarly, passion fruit has been introduced to numerous tropical islands as a fruit source and is sometimes produced commercially [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], The mechanism by which these species arrived in Galapagos is not known, but both species were likely initially grown from seed on private land. Local consumption is now high and the fruits of both are sold commercially in local markets (Blake pers. obs.). Viable seeds from both species are dispersed by a variety of frugivores [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] including tortoises [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], mocking birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], cattle (SB, pers. obs.) and humans, and both species pose serious problems to the floras of numerous oceanic islands and archipelagos worldwide [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>].
