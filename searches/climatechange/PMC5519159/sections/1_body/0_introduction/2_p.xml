<p class="p">Native biodiversity of the Galapagos Archipelago, where endemism is high [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], is under serious and increasing threat from invasive alien species [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. A total of 870 introduced plant species are now found on Galapagos which outnumber native species by 1.6:1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Alien plants are most abundant in humid highlands, particularly in farmland [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], but decline in the drier lowlands, which prevail over much of the Galapagos National Park [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. According to Trueman et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], alien species invasions on Galapagos will increase as human activities grow and because climate change will likely favour invasive over native species.
