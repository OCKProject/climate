<p class="p">The proportion of tortoise seed dispersal wasted under current conditions may change under future climate change. Scenarios for Galapagos predict an increase in the frequency and intensity of El Ni√±o events and increases in hot season temperature and rainfall leading to generally more humid conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0181333.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Increased moisture can be expected to favour the spread of introduced species into the currently relatively arid lowlands, at present dominated by native species. If tortoises maintain long distance migrations under climate change, the wasted seed dispersal of today may, in the future, result in an opportunity for rapid range expansion of tortoise-dispersed plant taxa, including invasive alien species.
