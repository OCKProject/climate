 <italic class="italic">Manihot esculenta Crantz</italic>), which can tolerate the stressful conditions such as drought, acidity and low soil fertility (Asher, Edwards &amp; Howeler

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Cassava is a potentially high yielding root crop of South American origin. It was introduced into Africa by Portuguese traders in the 16th century and into Zimbabwe from Angola, Malawi, Mozambique, Zaire and Zambia (Carter, Fresco &amp; Jones

 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>). It is against this background that this study sought to probe the potential of cassava production as climate change adaptation strategy in Chilonga in Chiredzi, Zimbabwe.
