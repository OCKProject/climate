<p class="p">One of the key challenges facing humanity today is climate change. The Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) indicates that the energy balance within the Earth’s climate system has been altered, and this has resulted in significant changes in national, regional and world climate. IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) has observed increases in average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level. In Zimbabwe, climate change presents risks to lives and livelihoods at the individual level and to the economy, and the livelihoods of the poor are highly vulnerable to climate change because of heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture (Brown

 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1991</xref>). The country’s annual mean surface temperature has warmed by about 0.4 °C from 1900 to 2000 (Chigwada 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The occurrence and amount of rainfall is becoming increasingly uncertain and the two decades from 1980 have witnessed a trend towards reduced rainfall or heavy rainfall and drought occurring in the same season (GoZ-UNDP/GEF
