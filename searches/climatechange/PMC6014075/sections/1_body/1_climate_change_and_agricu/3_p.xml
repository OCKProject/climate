<p class="p">Although cassava requires optimal conditions to achieve high growth rates, it performs well in drought-prone areas and on poor soils and is thus considered one of the most productive tropical crops on marginal lands (Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). In seasonally dry and semi-arid environments with less than 700 mm of annual rain, improved cultivars of cassava can give dry root yields of over 3 tonnes/ha (El-Sharkawy 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Therefore, cassava is often considered an insurance and hence major food security crop for resource-poor smallholder farmers in marginal lands (Kamukondiwa
