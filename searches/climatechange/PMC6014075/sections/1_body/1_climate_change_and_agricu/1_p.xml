<p class="p">The IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) defines climate change as a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g. by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer. Adaptation means anticipating the adverse effects of climate change and taking appropriate action to prevent or minimise the damage they can cause or taking advantage of opportunities which may arise (IPCC
