<p class="p">Individuals are not only motivated by information about risk but also by their direct experience with loss and harm brought about by living with hazards (Kasperson et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1988</xref>). The process of adaptation is affected by perception of risk and evaluation of information, and also by perception of oneâ€™s own capacity to adapt or self-efficacy. Motivation theory posits that much of human action can be explained through the concept of perceived self-efficacy, defined by Bandura (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>), as concerned with judgments of how well one can execute courses of actions required to deal with prospective situations. Perceived self-efficacy is positively associated with any behaviour from which a desired outcome is anticipated (Bandura 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1977</xref>). Frank et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) argue that smallholder farmers are highly perceptive of climate and its impact on their land and crops. When confronting environmental change, however, local knowledge is not always sufficient in building adaptive capacity. To adapt to change, new information is often needed, in this case information about the changing climate and feasible adaptations of farming practices.
