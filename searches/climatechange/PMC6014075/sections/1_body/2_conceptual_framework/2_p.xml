<p class="p">Motivation cannot be observed or measured directly, but can manifest itself through attitudinal and behavioural measures (Ambrose &amp; Kulik 
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1999</xref>). Behavioural manifestations may include active pursuit and use of information and implementation of adaptations. However, identifying both the generic- and climate-specific elements of smallholder farmersâ€™ adaptation behaviour is vital in order to facilitate a societal response to the changes that climate scientists have predicted (Sieber et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Tailoring adaptation practices to specific societies may make it possible to offset the adverse impacts of climate change (Fussel 2007). Moreover, assessments of economic adaptations show that in some cases returns on financial investments in adaptation are likely to exceed the returns from a baseline situation (Fussel 2007).
