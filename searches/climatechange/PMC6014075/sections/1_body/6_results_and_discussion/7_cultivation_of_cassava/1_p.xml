 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0009" class="xref">Figure 9</xref> shows that cultivation of Cassava in Chilonga Ward is still very low, represented by 38% of females and 15% male. Twenty-five percent know cassava and are not cultivating the crop and 22% do not know cassava. Production is still at subsistence level and is for domestic consumption as responded by the 53% that are practicing cassava production. Seventy-eight percent respondents indicated that women were more interested in cassava production than men. This is an indication that women were more motivated to produce cassava and 38% were willing to produce cassava crop on large scale. FAO (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) asserts that in a study that was carried out in Nigeria, it was found out that women play a central role in cassava production, processing and marketing, contributing about 58% of the total agricultural labour in the South West, 67% in the south-east and 58% in the central zones. FAO (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) also added that women are said to be entirely responsible for processing cassava which provides them with additional income-earning opportunities and enhances their ability to contribute to household food security. Cassava was introduced as an adaptation option in Chilonga Ward in 2007 by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Climate through EMA and financially supported by United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) through Coping with Drought and Climate Change Programme. By 2010, uptake of cassava remained at less than 1% and the low uptake was because of limited planting material, limited knowledge of the crop and extension services.
