<p class="p">Limitations of cassava production that came out from 78% of respondents include little or no knowledge of the crop. Seventy-eight percent of the respondents also indicated that they have limited seed, which is also a limiting factor in large-scale production. Seed is made available through Chiredzi Research Station at a cost and respondents argued that they lacked financial resources to purchase the seed. However, 38% indicated that they were going to get the seed cuttings from the cassava crop in Tamuwanyika Garden in Chilonga. Lack of resources was another limitation that was raised by 78% of the respondents. Fencing material protects the crop from livestock. The respondents echoed that after harvesting of the other crops, cassava will be the only crop that will be green in the fields and, therefore, animals will be attracted to the crop.</p>
