 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> shows that all respondents (100%) are into maize and sorghum cultivation. Groundnuts and roundnuts are cultivated by 63% of the respondents and 53% of the farmers are into cassava production. In Zimbabwe, agricultural policy encourages production of cash crops such as tobacco and maize at the expense of food crops; therefore, the District Council was promoting and encouraging the production of cassava and small-grain crops, especially pearl millet which is tolerant to heat waves and droughts.
