<p class="p">Cassava production in Zimbabwe only takes place on a very limited scale in Mashonaland West and the crop was identified as having potential for increasing diversification in Zimbabwean agriculture (Kleih 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1995</xref>). Cassava can be used as a food security and industrial crop because it is drought tolerant. There is a need to market cassava as an alternative food to the general populace of Zimbabwe, especially those who live in marginal areas which mainly receive less than 250 mm of rain and temperatures above 23 Â°C. In Zimbabwe, cassava production is negligible and has not been the focus of agriculture policy because more emphasis is put on production of cash crops such as maize and tobacco, of which these do not do well in areas like Chiredzi.
