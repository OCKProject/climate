<p class="p">Case studies in Nigeria and Ghana revealed that in Ghana cassava is a major crop with a hectarage under cassava was 387 000 ha in 1986 and increased to 590 000 ha in 1996 (USAID 
 <xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). During the same periods, cassava production also increased from about 2.9 million tonnes to 7.11 million tonnes. Cassava is by far the largest agricultural commodity produced in Ghana and represents 22% of Agriculture Gross Domestic Product (AGDP) compared with 5% for maize and 2% for rice (Al-Hassan

 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>). The 1987/1988 Ghana Living Standards Surveys (GLSS) showed that 1.73 million sampled households (83%) were engaged in cassava production compared with 1.74 million (86%) in maize production (FAO

 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>) postulated that almost all farmers in the main cassava belts of the south-eastern, south-western and central zones grow cassava. Cassava intercropped as a main or minor crop. Cassava produced in Nigeria is used for human consumption and less than 5% is used in industries (Adeniji et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>). Cassava as a food crop fits well into the farming systems of the smallholder farmers in Nigeria because it is available all year round, thus providing household food security (Alderman &amp; Higgens
