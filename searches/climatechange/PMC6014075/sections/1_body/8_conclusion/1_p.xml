<p class="p">Smallholder farmers remain vulnerable to climate variability and change in Zimbabwe, given their dependence on rain-fed agriculture. The farmers are aware of the changing weather patterns, major causes of change, as well as their impacts within their localities and are thus attributing this to climate change. The perception of smallholder farmers that climate is changing is supported by observables such as changes in rainfall amounts, rainfall distribution, onset and cessation of rains and average temperature. Conservation agriculture and production of drought-tolerant crops that thrive in all soil types are some of the major adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers (Herrera Campo, Hyman &amp; Bellotti
