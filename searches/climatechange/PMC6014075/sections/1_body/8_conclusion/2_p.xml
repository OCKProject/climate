<p class="p">In light of the above conclusions, the study recommends the following: 
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">There is a need for policy makers to review Zimbabwe’s agricultural policy so that it can encourage production of crops such as cassava. Given the increased frequency of extreme weather events induced by climate change, creating a framework for targeted adaptation is crucial to protect people’s livelihoods in marginal areas such as the Chiredzi District.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Farmers willing to grow cassava should be assisted with fencing material and seed; this can be on a loan basis with attractive repayment plan such as payment after sale of harvested produce.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Farmers, EMA, AGRITEX, Meteorological Services Department (MSD), Livestock Extension Officers and the Rural District Council Officers should invest in climate change adaptation strategies, training and initiation of cassava production.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">The issue of cultivating drought-tolerant crops is not yet a policy, but since independence in 1980 the Government of Zimbabwe has been encouraging farmers to grow cash crops such as tobacco. Instead, the drafting of a climate change policy should be expedited so that the growing of drought-tolerant crops such as cassava could become a major thrust. Adaptation is influenced to a certain extent by governmental actions.</p>
