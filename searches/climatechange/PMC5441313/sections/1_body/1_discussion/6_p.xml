<p class="p">Ogden et al. 
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[25]</xref> demonstrate that future climate warming will increase basic reproduction rates of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> in northern North America which will dramatically increase Lyme disease risk where it is already endemic, as well as extend the range into more northern regions where it is currently absent. For example, in the early 1990s only one documented endemic area of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> was known, namely Long Point on the Ontario shore of Lake Erie 
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[23]</xref>. The majority of newly endemic areas are now found across central Canada and eastern Canada 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[26]</xref>. Leighton et al. 
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[22]</xref> used surveillance data to demonstrate that Lyme vectors are spreading into Canada at a rate of 35–55 km per year and are following climate-determined geographic trajectories. In eastern Canada, tick populations are predicted to increase from 18% in 2010 to over 80% in 2020
