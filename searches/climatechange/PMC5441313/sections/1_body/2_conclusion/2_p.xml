<p class="p">Although all citizens are at risk for experiencing health-related impacts of climate change, some populations and regions have been identified as more vulnerable due to high exposure to climate hazards and limited capacity to adapt or cope

 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. Vulnerability depends on the rate and magnitude of environmental change, exposure levels and sensitivity, population demographics, and local adaptive capacity including social, cultural, political and economic conditions

 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[27]</xref>. These conditions and contexts vary across provinces and territories in Canada. Thus, the distribution of the Lyme disease vector and the public health strategies to address increasing incidence of Lyme disease may differ among each province leaving some communities more vulnerable to the climate related impacts of

Research is needed to explore these differences â€“ the fruits of this research may help propel and advise adaptation planning through the establishment of sustained dialogue and forums in which knowledge of existing strategies, adaptive capacity, perceived adaptation gaps, and best practices can be shared within and across localities 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[28]</xref>. Sustained, partnered research and knowledge mobilization teams are needed to connect evidence of climate predictions and projected human vulnerability with practice and policy strategies for a context-dependent and localized approach to reducing and managing health risks.
