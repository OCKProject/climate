 <italic class="italic">Action Plan on Lyme Disease</italic> and has also enacted Bill C-442 the Federal Framework on Lyme Disease Act. Both serve as a platform for greater collaboration between provincial and territorial health authorities as well as with the medical community and patient groups. Further to the federal action plan and Bill C-422, provincial and territorial health authorities implement provincial response strategies to further reduce the burden of Lyme disease. These response strategies vary according to local, provincial, and federal contexts and can include enacting legislation, developing guidance documents, conducting surveillance, and disseminating Lyme disease related information to both the general public and health care professionals.
