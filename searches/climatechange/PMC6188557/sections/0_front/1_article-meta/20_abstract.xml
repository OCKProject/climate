 <p class="p">Managing the emergence and spread of crop pests and pathogens is essential for global food security. Understanding how organisms have adapted to their native climate is key to predicting the impact of climate change. The potato cyst nematodes 
  <italic class="italic">Globodera pallida</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> are economically important plant pathogens that cause yield losses of up to 50% in potato. The two species have different thermal optima that may relate to differences in the altitude of their regions of origin in the Andes. Here, we demonstrate that juveniles of 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> are less able to recover from heat stress than those of 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. Genome-wide analysis revealed that while both 
  <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> species respond to heat stress by induction of various protective heat-inducible genes, 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> experiences heat stress at lower temperatures. We use 
  <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> as a model to demonstrate the dependence of the heat stress response on expression of Heat Shock Factor-1 (HSF-1). Moreover, we show that 
  <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> is induced by heat stress in 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>, but not in the less thermotolerant 
  <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene and its promoter was duplicated in 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and acquired thermoregulatory properties. We show that 
  <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> is required for recovery from acute thermal stress in both 
  <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> and in 
  <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>. Our findings point towards an underlying molecular mechanism that allows the differential expansion of one species relative to another closely related species under current climate change scenarios. Similar mechanisms may be true of other invertebrate species with pest status.
