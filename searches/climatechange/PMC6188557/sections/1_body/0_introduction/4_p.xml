 <italic class="italic">Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is also able to grow and reproduce within a 15–26 °C temperature range and, in response to a rapid temperature increase, an ancient and highly conserved program of stress-inducible gene expression, dependent on the transcription factor 1 HSF-1 and the thermosensory circuit is triggered to restore cellular protein homeostasis (

Induced chaperones play an important part in disaggregation, refolding or degradation of aggregated or damaged proteins. In animal cells disaggregation requires the HSC-70 chaperone system (HSP-70, HSP-40, and HSP-110) and the HSP-90 chaperone system (

 <xref rid="msy132-B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Machida et al. 2016</xref>). HSP-110 acts as a nucleotide exchange factor, releasing peptide substrate from HSP-70 in an ATP‐dependent manner (
