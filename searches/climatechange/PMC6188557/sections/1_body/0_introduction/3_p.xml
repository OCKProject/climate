<p class="p">Optimal hatching occurs at 13–25 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> and 15–27 °C for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>, respectively (
 <xref rid="msy132-B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kaczmarek et al. 2014</xref>). Females are able to develop within a temperature range of 15–25 °C for both species but optimal development for 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> occurs at 15–17.5 °C whilst that for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> occurs at 17.5–22.5 °C (

 <italic class="italic">Globodera pallida</italic> is also less tolerant of a diurnal temperature increase in soil temperature, with females taking longer to resume egg production (
 <xref rid="msy132-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al. 2017</xref>). In the absence of adaptation, increased soil temperatures associated with climate change are predicted to decrease the pest status of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> but benefit 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>, particularly in southern UK (
 <xref rid="msy132-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al. 2017</xref>). The molecular mechanisms underlying the differential temperature response of the two 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> species are unknown. Fortuitously, much of our understanding of the heat stress response in animals has been guided by research on the model nematode,
