To confirm that this phenomenon is life-stage independent, thus allowing us to study the underlying molecular basis in the technically more tractable infective juvenile, we exposed second-stage juveniles (J2s) to an acute heat stress (35 °C for 60 min) and measured the fraction motile every 1–3 h during a recovery period of 24 h. Immediately after heat stress, 100% of
