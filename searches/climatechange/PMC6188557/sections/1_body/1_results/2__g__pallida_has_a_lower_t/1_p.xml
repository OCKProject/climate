<p class="p">We investigated genome-wide gene expression profiles of both species following 60 min incubation at 20, 25, or 30 °C to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms for the lower ability of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> to recover from heat stress. Forty-six and 60 transcripts were differentially expressed between conditions for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and &gt;2.5-fold, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">supplementary file S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref> online). Genome-wide gene expression at 20 and 25 °C are technically indistinguishable for each species and cluster together, separated from all three 30 °C biological replicates (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">supplementary fig. S1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref> online). The majority of genes differentially expressed were upregulated at 30 °C compared with 20 and 25 °C: Following a 30 °C heat stress 37 transcripts were significantly upregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and 31 transcripts in 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and &gt;2.5-fold, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">supplementary file S2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref> online). The regulation of 15 transcripts which were significantly upregulated in 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> was confirmed by qPCR in both species (
 <xref rid="msy132-T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>, Pearson’s correlation = 0.973 and 0.923, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 for 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic>, respectively). Within the top 12 most highly induced genes in both species were putative orthologues of hsp20, hsp40, hsp70, and hsp90 genes, which have roles in protein folding (GO: 0006457, GO: 0030968) and 
 <italic class="italic">gly-8</italic> which is involved in protein glycosylation (GO: 0006486). The corresponding 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> orthologues are also significantly induced by heat stress (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001 and &gt;2.5-fold [
 <xref rid="msy132-B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brunquell et al. 2016</xref>]), demonstrating the suitability of 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> as a model to study the conserved heat stress response in plant-parasites.
