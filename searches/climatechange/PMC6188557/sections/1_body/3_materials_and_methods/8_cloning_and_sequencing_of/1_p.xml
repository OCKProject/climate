 <sup class="sup">TM</sup> Thermo Cycler (Bio-Rad) was programmed as follows; 3 min at 95 °C followed by 35 cycles of 30 s at 95 °C, 30 s at 55 °C and 5 min at 68 °C. PCR products were purified using the MicroElute cycle-pure kit (Omega) and cloned into pGEM T-easy (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasmids were extracted using the QIAprep Spin miniprep kit (Qiagen) and sequencing was carried out by GATC Biotech using M13 sequencing primers and those given in
