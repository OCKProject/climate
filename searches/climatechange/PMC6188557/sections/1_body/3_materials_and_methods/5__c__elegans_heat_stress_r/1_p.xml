Motility was assessed 24 h later by direct observation using a stereomicroscope. Each animal in the field of view at low magnification was observed for 3–4 sec and scored as recovered if they showed detectable movement before or after gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Approximately 30 nematodes were in the field of view and at least five observations of different worm batches (biological replicates) were used for each time point. RNAi knockdown efficiency of
