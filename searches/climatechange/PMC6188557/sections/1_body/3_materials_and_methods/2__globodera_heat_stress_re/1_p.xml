<p class="p">Second stage juveniles (J2) were hatched from encysted eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> Pa2/3 (population Lindley) or 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> (pathotype Ro1) at 20 ± 0.5 °C using root diffusates collected from 3-week old potato plants. J2s were transferred by pipette into 1.5 ml high recovery tubes (Axygen) at a density of one juvenile per µl root diffusate in a volume of 100 µl. Juveniles were then incubated in a circulating water bath at 35 ± 0.5 °C for 0–6 h prior to being placed on a rotating platform at 20 ± 0.5 °C to recover. Twenty-four hours later nematodes were pipetted directly onto a 55 mm petri dish and after 1 min, motility was assessed using a stereomicroscope. Each animal in the field of view at low magnification was observed for 3–4 s and scored as motile (recovered) if they showed detectable movement before or after gentle prodding with a platinum wire. Approximately 30 nematodes were in the field of view and at least five observations of different worm batches (biological replicates) were used for each time point. Statistical analyses were carried out in GraphPad Prism version 7.02 using an unpaired two-tailed Mann–Whitney test.
