After 5 days J2s were collected and pipetted into 1.5 ml high recovery tubes (Axygen) at a density of five juveniles per µl in tap water in a volume of 1 ml. Tubes were incubated, rotating, at 20, 25, or 30 ± 0.5 °C for 1 h. Nematodes were centrifuged at 100 × g for 30 s, residual water was aspirated and the remaining nematode pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. At least three biological replicates were used for each species and each incubation temperature.
