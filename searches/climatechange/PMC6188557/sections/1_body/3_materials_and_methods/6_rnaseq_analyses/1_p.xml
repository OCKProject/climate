<p class="p">Nematodes were disrupted in extraction buffer using a pestle motor mixer (Argos) and RNA was subsequently purified using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Quantity and quality of RNA was determined using a NanoDrop 2000 (Agilent) and 2100 BioAnalyser (Agilent). Libraries were prepared and 50 bp single end sequencing was carried out at the Next Generation Sequencing Facility at Leeds Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Sciences using an Illumina Hi Seq Instrument. Normalised gene expression values and differentially expressed genes were identified as previously described (
