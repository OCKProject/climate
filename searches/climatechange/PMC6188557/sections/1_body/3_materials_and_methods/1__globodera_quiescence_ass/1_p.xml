<p class="p">Second stage juveniles (J2) were hatched from encysted eggs of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> Pa2/3 (population Lindley) or 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> (pathotype Ro1) at 20 ± 0.5 °C using root diffusates collected from 3-week old potato plants. J2s were transferred by pipette into 1.5 ml high recovery tubes (Axygen) at a density of one juvenile per µl root diffusate in a volume of 100 µl. Juveniles were then incubated in a circulating water bath at 35 ± 0.5 °C for 60 min prior to being pipetted directly onto a 55 mm petri dish. After 1 min, motility was assessed over a 24-h period using a stereomicroscope. Each animal in the field of view at low magnification was observed for 3–4 s and scored as quiescent if they did not show an active sinusoidal form and movement. Approximately 30 nematodes were in the field of view and at least five observations of different worm batches (biological replicates) were used for each time point. Statistical analyses was carried out in GraphPad Prism version 7.02 using a log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test.
