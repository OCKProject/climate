 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was used without additional magnesium. The Bio-Rad CFX96 was programmed as follows; 30 s at 95 °C followed by 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C and 30 s at 60 °C. Raw data was analysed in Microsoft Excel and GraphPad Prism version 7.02 using a Kruskal–Wallis test followed by Dunn’s multiple comparison test.
