Ten adult hermaphrodites were transferred to fresh plates and allowed to lay embryos for 8 h before being removed. The progeny were allowed to continue growth to L4 stage at 15, 20, or 25 ± 0.5 °C prior to collection in M9 buffer. L4 stage nematodes were identified by the presence of a large white crescent-shaped mark in the vulval region (

Nematodes were allowed to settle, residual M9 buffer was aspirated and the remaining nematode pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. At least three biological replicates were used for each RNAi condition and incubation temperature.
