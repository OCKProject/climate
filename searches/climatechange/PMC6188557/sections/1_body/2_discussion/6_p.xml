<p class="p">An increase of up to 0.5 °C per decade has been projected for summer soil temperatures in the UK, with similar projected increases for sites in Sweden, Alaska and the northern forest (

 <xref rid="msy132-B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al. 2017</xref>). Our analysis of the molecular mechanisms which underpin thermosensitivity in 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> has limited potential to alter its thermal limits within this context. Although numerous reports suggest that small aquatic ectotherms with short generation times are able to increase their thermal niche during climate change (

 <xref rid="msy132-B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Irwin et al. 2015</xref>) the longer generation time makes it unlikely that 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> can increase its thermal limit for growth and reproduction at the rate of climate change. This is in agreement with lack of evidence for any terrestrial ectotherms with long generation times being able to adapt with climate change (

 <xref rid="msy132-B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoffmann et al. 2013</xref>). If these reflect evolutionary constraints, substantial molecular changes (such as the duplication and expression divergence of genes) may be required to increase upper thermal limits. Since 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> has the capacity to withstand higher soil temperatures, incorporation of qualitative resistance that is present in widely grown potato cultivars should be continued. Future control of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> would be assisted by use of cultivars able to withstand climate change effects in the current potato growing areas.
