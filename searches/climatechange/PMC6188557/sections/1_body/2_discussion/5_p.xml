<p class="p">The requirement of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> (C30C11.4) for recovery from acute heat stress in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> is consistent with a role for HSP-110 as a nucleotide exchange factor for the HSP40-HSP70 disaggregation machinery and its necessity for normal lifespan following acute heat stress in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (

 <xref rid="msy132-B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rampelt et al. 2012</xref>). It is likely that 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> is also required for maintaining protein homeostasis under physiological conditions since various developmental phenotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> under RNAi knockdown have also been reported (
 <xref rid="msy132-B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gonczy et al. 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kamath et al. 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Simmer et al. 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sönnichsen et al. 2005</xref>). Constitutive expression has been observed in the pharynx, body wall muscle and nervous system of 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> (
 <xref rid="msy132-B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dupuy et al. 2007</xref>). Similarly, hsp110 transcript and protein is present in most murine tissues and is highly expressed in the brain (

 <xref rid="msy132-B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yasuda et al. 1995</xref>). Although 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> is a single gene copy in mammals (
 <xref rid="msy132-B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lee-Yoon et al. 1995</xref>), two isoforms have been identified (105α and 105β), which differ in their subcellular location and induction (
 <xref rid="msy132-B88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yasuda et al. 1995</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ishihara et al. 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saito et al. 2009</xref>). The generally constitutive expression of Hsp105α has is increased by various stressors, whereas 105β is strictly heat inducible. The presence of these two differently regulated isoforms in mammals suggests that this gene is under high selection during both physiological and heat stress conditions.
