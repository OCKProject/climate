<p class="p">It was previously suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> became adapted to lower temperatures following the rise of the Andean chain during the Miocene, whereas 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic> originated from where uplift of the paleo-Andes was less extreme and therefore the climate was slightly warmer (
 <xref rid="msy132-B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Plantard et al. 2008</xref>). Our new analysis presents an alternative theory. It suggests that the three analysed 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> species diverged from a common ancestor that was already adapted to a cooler climate. This ancestral species had presumably lost the thermoregulation of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> found in other nematodes from all four clades (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref> online). The origins of 
 <italic class="italic">G. ellingtonae</italic>, a species recently identified in three potato-growing fields within two US states, are unknown (
 <xref rid="msy132-B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Handoo et al. 2012</xref>). The presence in 
 <italic class="italic">G. ellingtonae</italic> of only a single 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic> gene lacking the promoter elements required for heat induction suggests, however, that both this species and 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> were adapted to a similar cool climate as their common ancestor. Presumably, during or after the speciation that gave rise to 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>, movement to lower altitudes with a warmer climate provided selection pressure for the duplication and regain of heat regulation of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-110</italic>.
