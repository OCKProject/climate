<p class="p">Although expression of hsp20 small heat shock protein genes is induced by heat stress in both 
 <italic class="italic">Globodera</italic> species, the particular temperature shift required for induction differs. For 
 <italic class="italic">G. rostochiensis</italic>, significant increases in expression only occurred at 25 °C and above. Expression of these genes in 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> increased over the range 15–25 °C and was significantly higher at temperatures of 20 °C and above, consistent with an optimum temperature lower than 20 °C. A similar increase in expression of hsp20 genes with culture temperature was also found in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic>, consistent with an optimal temperature of 18 °C for this species (
 <xref rid="msy132-B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Begasse et al. 2015</xref>). RNAi knockdown revealed that increased induction of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.1</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.2</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.41</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.48</italic> with culture temperature was dependent on 
 <italic class="italic">hsf-1</italic> and that 
 <italic class="italic">daf-16</italic> was also required for increased expression of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.2</italic> at higher temperatures. This is consistent with previous RNAseq analysis which found that 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16</italic> genes (but not members of hsp40, hsp70, and hsp90 gene families) were significantly down-regulated during RNAi knockdown of 
 <italic class="italic">hsf-1</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">C. elegans</italic> cultured at 20 °C (
 <xref rid="msy132-B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brunquell et al. 2016</xref>). Since the DAF-16 binding element (
 <xref rid="msy132-B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Furuyama et al. 2000</xref>) was not found in the promoter region of 
 <italic class="italic">hsp-16.2</italic> it is possible that this gene is being regulated indirectly as previously suggested (
 <xref rid="msy132-B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schuster et al. 2010</xref>). Although both HSF-1 and DAF-16 are required for survival at higher temperatures (i.e., thermotolerance) in

 <xref rid="msy132-B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Horikawa et al. 2015</xref>) a trade-off between activation of the heat stress response and fecundity has been reported (

 <xref rid="msy132-B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aprison and Ruvinsky 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="msy132-B54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Labbadia and Morimoto 2015</xref>), acting as a “bet-hedging” strategy to diversify risk (

 <xref rid="msy132-B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kussell and Leibler 2005</xref>). As HSF-1 can be directly activated by the neuronal circuit to pre-empt cellular damage caused by heat stress (
 <xref rid="msy132-B71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prahlad et al. 2008</xref>) it is likely that enhanced Hsp20 expression arises from adaptation of 
 <italic class="italic">G. pallida</italic> to a lower thermal limit than
