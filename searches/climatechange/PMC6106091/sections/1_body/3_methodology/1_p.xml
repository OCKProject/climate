<p id="Par20" class="p">The fieldwork focused on understanding the diverse impacts of environmental stress on livelihood resilience. In addition, it included a participatory assessment of the effectiveness of the past and present adaptation policy and projects in the study sites (Tschakert et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2002</xref>; Dietz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2013</xref>). The qualitative method used in this article, livelihood histories (LH), is individual life histories that focus on changes in people’s livelihoods (Van der Geest 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2004</xref>). A livelihood perspective in development research and practice enhances understanding of the complexity of rural development (Scoones

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2009</xref>; Cannon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2003</xref>). The LHs address a common critique of livelihood research: that it tends to be a-historical (De Haan and Zoomers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2005</xref>). Reconstructing changes in people’s livelihoods over time, using semi-structured interviews, allows a unique and dynamic view of how environmental stressors and shocks affected people; how they coped with immediate consequences; how they tried to recover; whether they were successful; and what the barriers to full recovery were. Twenty-eight LHs in total, four in each study site were reconstructed. A gender, age, and class balance were maintained in the selection of informants. To ensure that the research findings identified potential gender differences half of the 28 informants were men and half women. The youngest informant was in his 20s and the oldest in her late 70s (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). As the Livelihood History interviews aimed to capture livelihood changes over time, older informants were intentionally oversampled. People involved in livelihood activity for a couple of decades will be able to tell more about changes and stress over a longer period. Communicative informants were overrepresented due to the open narrative structure of the interviews. The field schedule included time for conversation with several community members before starting off the interview sessions. Most informants were identified during other field research sessions, such as the transect walk, PRA sessions, or institutional landscaping. During the sampling, the researchers made sure that the livelihood activities, climatic experiences, and living conditions reflected the study site communities. People who had recently migrated to the community, or had spent a notable amount of time living elsewhere, were not selected, as the adaptation strategies aimed to reflect the history of study sites. The informant sample aimed to reflect the balance of livelihood activities and socio-economic foundation of the communities.
