<p id="Par23" class="p">Qualitative research on people’s responses to environmental stress provides decision and policy makers with crucial insights that support the creation of sustainable climate policies. Oliver-Smith (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">1996</xref>), for example, argues that understanding disasters, stress, and shocks from an anthropological and societal viewpoint are crucial. Disasters, environmental stress, and shocks help signal the response processes and failures of a society to adapt successfully to specific features of its natural and socially constructed environment (Blaikie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>; Cannon and Müller-Mahn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2010</xref>). That is why it is important to understand how and why people’s adaptation strategies sometimes fail, or why people do not adapt at all. Understanding the sustainability of a society is critical to its survival and increased resilience level (Oliver-Smith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">1996</xref>; Brown and Westaway 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2011</xref>). The greater cross-disciplinary communication and collaboration between quantitative and qualitative scientists, within the field of disaster research, is a result of the increased urgency surrounding the topic. The study of human–environment interaction is a key to address social issues and problems which contribute to the complexity and difficulties of disaster response, resilience level, and adaptive capacity (Oliver-Smith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">1996</xref>; Grothmann and Patt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2005</xref>; Tompkins and Adger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2004</xref>). Adger (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2010</xref>) argues that policy discussions frame the impacts of climate change as a threat to nation-states, so the discourse has moved away from people, and their capability to adapt to imposed harm and human wellbeing. Human security provides a broader understanding of climate security than one focused on the security of states. That is because it includes justice, adaptation, and vulnerability (Adger
