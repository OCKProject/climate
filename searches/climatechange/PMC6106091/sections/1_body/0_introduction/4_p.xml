<p class="p">Livelihood resilience is a central concept in this article. In ecology, resilience is usually seen as a system’s ability to absorb and recover from disturbance (Folke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2004</xref>; Gall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). The resilience process depends on a number of factors, such as previous condition, the time between disturbances, and their severity (Cutter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2008</xref>). This study takes a people-centred perspective on resilience
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> that emphasises not only the ability to absorb shocks and recover, but also livelihood improvement, despite disturbances. The definition of adaptation
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> used in this article is in line with the one commonly referred to in the climate change field, also by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Adaptation must consider climate change, but it may not be to climate change alone; the informants in this study describe responding practices to environmental stress in Bangladesh. As the adaptation definition includes short-term coping as well as long-term transformations, they are also considered as adaptation strategies. In addition, this article defines disasters
