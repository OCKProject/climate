<p id="Par19" class="p">The rationale for choosing those seven study sites in Bangladesh was that places with long historical experience of climate-related stress can provide valuable insights about confronting climatic challenges. These insights are valuable to regional and international communities around the world that may have to deal with related stress. As observed on the map (see Fig.Â

 <italic class="italic">Babupur</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Jamalpur</italic>) are situated in the north-western drought affected side of the country. The last two sites (
 <italic class="italic">Singpur</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Bhola Slum</italic>) are centrally located. The Singpur community is facing riverbank erosion, land loss, and floods, while Bhola Slum, in the capital Dhaka, was added to investigate what happens to people after migrating from rural to urban areas due to environmental stress. The slum is named after Bhola Island, from where most of the inhabitants migrated after cyclones and abrupt riverbank erosion (McNamara et al.
