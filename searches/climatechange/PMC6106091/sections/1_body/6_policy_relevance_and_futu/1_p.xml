<p id="Par118" class="p">Any policy framework that aims to address climatic and other environmental changes and shocks as well as to protect wellbeing in vulnerable delta regions must include elements of adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and post-disaster relief (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2003</xref>; Folke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2004</xref>). Currently, disaster preparedness is often good on paper but not very successful in real life. That can be because of a lack of assessment of community needs, or because of exclusion of the community in the decision-making processes (Keeley and Scoones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2014</xref>; Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1993</xref>; Blaikie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>). Mistakes are, therefore, repeated. More and regularly repeated community evaluations of disaster preparedness training and early warning systems can help improve the community preparedness. In the longer term, such assessments would help increase people’s livelihood resilience level. For example, if people would have time to put their livestock, fishing nets, and boats in safety prior a cyclone, fewer livelihood assets would be lost. Furthermore, ensuring enough time for people to save their livelihood assets would result in them being able to pick up their livelihoods sooner after a cyclone strike. After a cyclone, organizations should, therefore, try to find out how well the early warning system worked and what improvements are needed (Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">1993</xref>; Alam and Rahman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2014</xref>). Serious gaps in the early warning system against cyclones were highlighted in the interviews, as well as the lack of EWS evaluation:
