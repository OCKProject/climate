 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">1985</xref>) that draws on the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA; Fishbein and Ajzen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">1975</xref>), (ii) the Values Beliefs Norms Theory (VBN; Stern 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2000</xref>), (iii) the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT; Rogers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">1983</xref>; Rogers and Prentice-Dunn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">1997</xref>), and (iv) the Model of Private Proactive Adaptation to Climate Change (MPPACC; Grothmann
