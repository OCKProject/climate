<p class="p">Longer more spatially comprehensive records of giant kelp canopy biomass were estimated at 30-m resolution from 1984–2015 using multispectral Landsat 5 and 7 Thematic Mapper satellite imagery following procedures developed by Cavanaugh 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. Kelp canopy biomass was estimated using the observed relationship between diver-estimated kelp canopy biomass at our study sites and Landsat pixel kelp fraction. Cloud-free imagery allowed kelp biomass to be estimated approximately monthly. Seasonal canopy biomass determinations for each 30 m × 30 m pixel along the mainland coast of the counties of Santa Barbara, Los Angeles and San Diego Channel were summed to produce a value of kelp canopy biomass for each county, for each season of the 32-year time series.
