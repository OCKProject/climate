<p class="p">Annual community surveys of marine flora and fauna were performed by divers using SCUBA in late July to early August each year. Sampling was done within 34 permanently located 40 m × 2 m plots distributed among the nine kelp forest sites. The density and size of giant kelp, large solitary understory algae, large mobile invertebrates and reef-associated fishes were measured within each plot (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> quadrats placed at 8 m intervals along the 40 m axis of each plot. The per cent cover of sessile invertebrates and understory algae that are impractical to count as individuals was measured at 80 uniformly spaced points within each plot. Data on size and abundance of each species counted in the surveys were converted into biomass using species specific relationships developed for algae
