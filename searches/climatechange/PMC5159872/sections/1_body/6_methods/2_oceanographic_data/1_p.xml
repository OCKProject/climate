<p class="p">Sea temperature was measured every 10 min using loggers (Stowaway Onset tidbits, accuracy±0.2 °C; Onset Computer, Bourne, Massachusetts, USA) fastened to the bottom at each site. Longer records of ocean temperature from 1982–2015 were obtained for the Santa Barbara region from the National Climatic Data Center Optimal Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature data. These data combine measurements from several sources including ship, buoys and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer satellite images from January 1982–December 2015 to produce a daily averaged data set with a resolution of 0.25 °C. The values shown in
