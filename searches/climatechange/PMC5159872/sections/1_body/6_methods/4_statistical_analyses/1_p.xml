<p class="p">The primary focus of our study was on detecting regional responses to a large-scale warming event. Therefore, our analyses involved models using regional means averaged across the nine sites rather than estimates of the mean and variance of variables from the time series of individual sites (for example, the regional mean and variance in the relationship between local kelp biomass and local temperature that would be derived from a mixed effects model). Thus we evaluated the amount of variation in the regional summer biomass of the different functional groups of kelp forest species that was explained by anomalous warming using stepwise multiple regression with a threshold level of significance=0.15 for entry into the model (SAS 9.4, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). Annual anomalies in bottom temperature for the 12-month period preceding the summer measurements of biomass were used as an independent variable in the regression analysis of each functional group. Year was included as an additional independent continuous variable to account for temporal trends not explained by anomalous oceanographic conditions. Multi-collinearity of the two independent variables was low in all cases; condition indices were&lt;26 and variance inflation factors&lt;2 for all analyses.</p>
