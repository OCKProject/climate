<p class="p">The biomass of sea urchins, the most important grazers in kelp forests worldwide
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, showed no consistent trend over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3d</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, neither the biomass of giant kelp nor understory algae explained any of the year-to-year variation in sea urchin biomass (neither variable met the 0.15 significance level for entry into a stepwise multiple regression model regardless of whether data for kelp and understory algae were derived from the same year as sea urchins or the previous year). Instead sea urchin biomass was negatively correlated with anomalies in bottom temperature (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>) Sea urchin biomass reached its lowest level in 2015 when it declined by 50% from 2014. This abrupt decline is consistent with a rapid response to extreme warming that occurred during the previous 12 months. Indeed, our observations suggested that this abrupt decline resulted from an infectious disease (as evidenced by visible lesions on the epidermis) that is known to spread rapidly during warm periods
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. The absence of a large positive response by giant kelp and understory algae coinciding with this decrease in sea urchin biomass, and the generally poor correlation between sea urchins and their algal food supply throughout the time series, emphasizes the complexity of biotic and abiotic interactions in kelp-dominated systems
