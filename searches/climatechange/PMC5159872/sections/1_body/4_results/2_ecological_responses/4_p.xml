<p class="p">The most dramatic response to warming was observed in sea stars, an important group of invertebrate predators. Unlike other components of the kelp forest community, sea stars were increasing before the onset of warming in 2014, which accounted for an overall increasing trend during the time series (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, in 2014 an epidemic outbreak of wasting disease led to mass mortalities of at least 20 species of sea stars from Alaska to Mexico

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> and the anomalously warm water temperatures have been implicated in increasing its spread and the mortality rate in sea stars
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. This implication is consistent with the negative relationship that we observed between sea star biomass and bottom temperature anomalies (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2e</xref>). So far the mass mortalities of sea stars have not led to corresponding increases in their prey. The biomass of piddocks and shelled gastropods, favourite prey of sea stars, did not change appreciably in the 2 years following the disappearance of sea stars (
