<p class="p">We observed the first signs of prolonged warming of bottom waters within kelp forests of the Santa Barbara Channel in late December 2013 when temperature anomalies turned conspicuously positive (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>). Positive monthly temperature anomalies persisted through December 2015 with daily deviations as high as +5.8 °C and monthly deviations averaging as much as +4.6 °C. The unprecedented extent of the warming is evidenced by the occurrence and duration of unusually warm water events in 2014–2015 compared with earlier in the time series (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). Fifty-eight per cent of the days during 2014 and 2015 (423 of 730 days) met the criteria of a marine heatwave (that is, five or more consecutive days when the mean temperature is warmer than the 90th percentile)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref> compared with only 3.4% (162 of 4,748 days) during the previous 13 years. Moreover, the duration of heatwaves averaged three times longer during 2014–2015 (mean=39 days, maximum=151 days,
