 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>), which made it difficult to disentangle the effects of ocean warming and low nutrients on kelp forests from those caused by wave disturbance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. Unlike ocean temperature and nutrients, the wave climate in the Santa Barbara Channel during 2014 and 2015 was largely unremarkable. The largest monthly anomaly in maximum significant wave height during the recent warm period was 0.54 m in October 2014 compared with 1.2 m in March 1983 and 2.3 m in February 1998 (
