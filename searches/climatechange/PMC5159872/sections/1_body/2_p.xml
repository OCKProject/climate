<p class="p">Time series data of giant kelp forest ecosystems in southern California collected by the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological research program provided us with a unique opportunity to examine the effects of the unprecedented warming on an important coastal foundation species, the giant kelp 
 <italic class="italic">Macrocystis pyrifera</italic>, and its associated ecosystem, and to assess the value of kelp forests as sentinels for detecting early signs of climate related impacts. Like most kelps, the growth and survival of 
 <italic class="italic">Macrocystis</italic> are considered highly vulnerable to prolonged conditions of warm, nutrient-poor water
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> and such conditions have been implicated as the cause for massive regional declines
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. The demography and physiology of 
 <italic class="italic">Macrocystis</italic> make it potentially well suited as a climate sentinel because of its rapid growth (2% dry mass per day)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, high biomass turnover (6–7 times per year)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref> and relatively high nitrogen demand (&gt;1 μmol l
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> needed to sustain growth)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>; yet, limited capacity for internal nitrogen storage (&lt;3 weeks)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> should cause its biomass to respond quickly to prolonged unfavourable growing conditions associated with climate change.
