Anomalous environmental conditions offer exceptional opportunities to test our expectations for ecosystem responses to climate change. The lack of an expected response to an extreme event, as in our study, reveals our limited ability to predict responses to longer term changes. Such limits on our forecasting ability underscore the key role of long-term data in detecting the effects of climate change on ecosystems as they occur

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Indeed, given the cost of collecting long-term data, efforts to focus research on the most sensitive and vulnerable species seem wise. However, our results expose the potential dangers of relying on easily measured iconic species with supposed sensitive traits as sentinels for evaluating ecosystem responses to climate change. We suggest that in the absence of an ability to reliably predict sentinel species, broader spectrum ecological monitoring is necessary to inform us of the status of biodiversity in the face of climate change.
