 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>, but are proving difficult and costly to measure. This has led to a growing interest in using sentinel species as early warning indicators of impending climate change effects on entire ecosystems

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Identifying sentinel species most likely to be early indicators of climate change would seem a logical way to direct limited monitoring and conservation resources
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. If such sentinel species were also foundation species on which other species depend, then their decline could destabilize and collapse entire ecosystems
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Coastal marine ecosystems supported by foundation species in temperate seas (for example, kelp forests, seagrass meadows and salt marshes) are reported to be particularly sensitive to ocean warming and low-nutrient availability associated with climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>, and thus are expected to have been greatly affected by the extraordinary warming that recently occurred off the Pacific coast of North America
