<p class="p">The LARS-WG (Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator) is a random weather generator that can be used to simulate the historical and future meteorological data of a single station. It is a dimensionality reduction tool based on the GCM to generate local-scale climate scenarios. It uses the daily meteorological data of a given location to calculate a set of parameters for fitting probability distribution and their correlations. A synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length is generated by using the randomly selected values from the appropriate distribution [

The LARS-WG 6.0 used in this paper combines the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report for climate prediction. The process of weather generation is divided into the following three steps [
