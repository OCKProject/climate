<p class="p">Climate data based on a GCM are widely regarded as the most acceptable model for studying climate change. Under different GCM scenarios, the magnitude of variation of meteorological factors is uncertain. Therefore, two RCPs under four GCMs in CMIP5 supported by LARS-WG 6.0 are selected to simulate future climate change. The main information of the four GCMs used is shown in
