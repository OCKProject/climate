<p class="p">In this paper, the daily Tmax, Tmin, rainfall, and Rad of 26 meteorological stations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>) in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were used as historical input data for LARS-WG calibration and verification. The historical meteorological data was obtained from the China National Meteorological Information Center (
 <uri xlink:href="http://data.cma.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://data.cma.cn/</uri>). In order to evaluate the performance of LARS-WG, the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (K-S) test was performed on testing the equality of the seasonal distributions of dry and wet series (WDseries), distributions of daily rainfall (RainD), distributions of daily Tmax (TmaxD), distributions of daily Tmin (TminD), and distributions of daily Rad (RadD) calculated from the history data and downscale data, and a 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test was performed on testing equality of the monthly mean rainfall (RainM), monthly mean of Tmax (TmaxM), monthly mean of Tmin (TminM), and monthly mean of Rad(RadM). For each station, the number of WDseries tests was eight, and the number of tests for other parameters was 12. The smaller the average number of meteorological station parameters

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00692-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows that LARS-WG can well simulate the above parameters, and the model is more capable of simulating the monthly distribution of each parameter than the monthly mean of each parameter in the study area of this paper.
