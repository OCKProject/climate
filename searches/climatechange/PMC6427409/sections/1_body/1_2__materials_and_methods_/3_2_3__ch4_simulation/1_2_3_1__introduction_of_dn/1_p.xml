<p class="p">The DNDC model is a geobiochemical model that is used to simulate greenhouse gas emissions from different agroecosystems. It has been widely used to simulate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields all over the world over the past 20 years. Numerous studies have shown that DNDC can be used to estimate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields at a regional scale [

The first part includes three sub-models: soil climate, crop growth, and soil organic matter decomposition. According to the input meteorological, soil, crop, and farming management data, the dynamic changes of soil temperature, water, redox potential, chemical substrate concentration, and other factors in soil environmental conditions are simulated. The second part includes three sub-models of nitrification, denitrification, and fermentation, which simulate the effects of various factors in soil on microbial activity and chemical reaction rate, and calculate greenhouse gas emissions [
