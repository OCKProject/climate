<p class="p">The DNDC model needs meteorological data, soil data, crop parameters, and farmland management measures to simulate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields. In this study, the annual CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from 26 meteorological stations in the study area were simulated by the DNDC model. For CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from 2021 to 2080, the average values of four GCMs under two RCPs were calculated respectively, and then, the spatial and temporal variations of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes were expressed by spatial interpolation. The period 1960–2015 was divided into three periods: 1960–1979 (1970s), 1980–1999 (1990s), and 2000–2015 (2010s). The period 2021–2080 was divided into 2021–2040 (2030s), 2041–2060 (2050s), and 2061–2080 (2070s).
