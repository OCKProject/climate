<p class="p">For the simulation of the period 1960–2015, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were selected, including daily Tmax, Tmin, average relative humidity, average wind speed, and rainfall. For the simulation of 2021–2080, the daily meteorological data of 26 meteorological stations were output by LARS-WG, including daily Tmax, Tmin, rainfall, and Rad. Considering the change of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration under climate change, the background CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in 1960 was 317 ppm and the growth rate was 1.58 ppm/a. For future climate simulation, the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> background concentrations were 411 ppm and 415 ppm under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 in 2021, respectively, and 531 ppm and 758 ppm in 2080, respectively [
