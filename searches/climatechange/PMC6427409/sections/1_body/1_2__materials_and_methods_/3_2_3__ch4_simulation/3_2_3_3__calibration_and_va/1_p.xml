 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields are affected by many factors, some of which may be more sensitive than others [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Sensitivity analysis help to better understand the sensitivity of the model to various parameters and provide support for the calibration and validation. Therefore, sensitivity analysis of the DNDC model was performed to evaluate the response of simulation results to input parameters [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Climate, soil, and crop parameters of the site experiment were taken as the initial conditions for sensitivity analysis, and a single input parameter was changed within the default range of the DNDC model system, while all the other input parameters remained unchanged. Each input parameter was run 500 times to ensure the reliability of the results. For those more sensitive factors, attention should be paid during the model simulation to improve the reliability of the data.
