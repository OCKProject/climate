<p class="p">This study simulated the historical and future spatiotemporal dynamics of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> from paddy fields in the cold region of Heilongjiang Province under different climate scenarios using a combination of the DNDC model and the LARS-WG model. The simulation results showed that from 1960 to 2015, the average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux in the study area was 145.56 kg C/ha, showing a decreasing trend from west to east. The average climate tendency was 11.88 kg C/ha/(10a). The climate tendencies of the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the northern and western parts were higher. Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from 2021 to 2080 increased by 67.50 kg C/ha and 106.23 kg C/ha, respectively, compared with the average historical value. The spatial distribution tended to decrease from west to east. The average climatic tendency increased by 1.52 kg C/ha/(10a) and 17.98 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively, compared with the historical background values. The CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxesâ€™ climate tendency decreased from west to east. The correlation analysis and regression analysis showed that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes increased with the increase of Tmin, Tmax, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Under future climate change scenarios, atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature will affect the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes of paddy fields through the interaction of soil and plant in the cold region of Heilongjiang Province. To reduce the effects of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature on increasing CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, more attention should be paid to improve rice cultivars with low plant biomass to reduce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and carbon substrate supply. Moreover, reducing the additional carbon source such as stubble and straw incorporation to control the increase of SOC should be also considered. Furthermore, effective and efficient policies and measures should be applied to technologies such as paddy water management and soil cultivation, as well as the training and education to the farmers to decrease the impact of climate change on CH
