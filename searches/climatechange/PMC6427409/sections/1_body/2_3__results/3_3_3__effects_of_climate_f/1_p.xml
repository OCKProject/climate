<p class="p">As the uncertainty of future meteorological data is high, in order to study the effects of climate factors on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, the correlation analysis and regression analysis of historical meteorological data and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission fluxes at each station in the study area were carried out. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f012" class="xref">Figure 12</xref>, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes increased with the increase of Tmax, Tmin, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and were significantly correlated with them (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes decreased first and then increased with the increase of rainfall and Rad, and the correlation between them was not significant. Therefore, the increase of Tmax, Tmin, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration at each station in the study area from 1960 to 2015 (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) promoted the increase of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes. Compared with historical average, the Tmin, Tmax, and the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in the 2070s period increased by 1.90 째C, 2.17 째C, and 92.80 ppm (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), respectively, resulting in a 92.8 kg C/ha increase in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, which was an increase of 64%. Under RCP 8.5 in the 2070s, the Tmin, Tmax, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration increased by 3.71 째C, 3.86 째C, and 172.69 ppm (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00692-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), respectively, resulting in an increase of 172.69 kg C/ha in CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, with an increase of 118%, which was greater than that under RCP 4.5. The above analysis showed that increasing temperature and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration can accelerate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes.
