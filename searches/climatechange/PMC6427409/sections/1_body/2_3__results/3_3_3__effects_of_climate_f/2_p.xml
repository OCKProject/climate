<p class="p">In order to further study the effects of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, the four simulation scenarios are as follows: (1) the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature do not change; (2) the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration increases, but the temperature does not change; (3) the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration does not change, but the temperature changes; and (4) both the atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature change. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f013" class="xref">Figure 13</xref> showed the response of SOC content in the 0–20-cm soil layer, biomass (including leaf, stem, and root), and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes to climate changes under RCP 4.5 in the site experiment. Increased atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and successive years of stubble returning would lead to the increase of SOC content in the 0–20-cm soil layer and the accumulation of plant biomass year by year. The decomposition of SOC would be promoted by the increase of air temperature, and the plant biomass will be increased in the coming 20 years. Compared with scenario one, the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in scenario two, scenario three, and scenario four increased by 13.74%, 16.31%, and 32.78% at the end of the simulation. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enhanced the root system of crops through plant photosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], provided more metabolic substrates for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, and increased the aerenchyma of plants by increasing the biomass, thus providing a channel for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes had a significant correlation with the biomass of crops [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Increasing soil temperature would promote the decomposition of SOC and increase the activity and amount of methanogens. Compared with CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> oxidation process is less affected by temperature [
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Under future climate scenarios, atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and temperature will affect the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes of paddy field through the joint effects of soil and plant.
