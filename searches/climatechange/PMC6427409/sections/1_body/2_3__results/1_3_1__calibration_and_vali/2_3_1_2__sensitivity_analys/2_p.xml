<p class="p">A sensitivity analysis of soil parameters showed that soil clay content was the most sensitive factor affecting CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, followed by soil porosity and SOC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Soil with high clay content limits CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes due to the adsorption of clay, which limits the use of dissolved organic carbon by microorganisms. The increase of porosity will promote the oxidation of methanogens to produce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>, and SOC will provide more substrates for methanogens to produce CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>. Since paddy fields are flooded most of the time during the rice-growing period, the change of soil moisture and dryness is small, and the soil condition is relatively stable; therefore, the effects of soil bulk density, field water capacity, and pH on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes are small [
