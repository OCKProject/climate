<p class="p">A sensitivity analysis of crop parameters showed that CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes were more sensitive to maximum yield, plant C/N ratio, and thermal degree days for maturity (TDD), but less sensitive to the N fixation index (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). With the increase of the above parameters, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes showed an increasing trend. This is because with the increase of TDD, more dry matter can be accumulated in crops with the same proportion of biomass distribution in different parts of the plant. Increasing the maximum yield also increases biomass accumulation in plants, since it is beneficial for increasing plant droppings and root exudates, which provides more carbon sources for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production. Increasing the plant C/N ratio also provides more carbon sources for methanogens.
