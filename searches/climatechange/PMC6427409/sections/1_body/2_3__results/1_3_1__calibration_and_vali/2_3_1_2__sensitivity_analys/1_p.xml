<p class="p">The response of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes to climate factors was studied by fluctuating 10% of the air temperature, rainfall, and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, higher air temperature and higher atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration promote the increase of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes. This may be because the increase of air temperature is beneficial to the decomposition of soil organic matter and the activity of methanogens [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Increased atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration provides more metabolic substrates for methane production [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The change of annual rainfall has little effect on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes. With the decrease of rainfall, the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux increases slightly.
