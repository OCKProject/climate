<p class="p">Comparisons of the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes observed in the site experiment with those simulated by DNDC are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Except for individual differences, the simulation results of DNDC are in good agreement with the observed results. Regression analysis shows that the regression coefficient R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> is 0.89, the slope of regression equation is close to one, and the intercept is relatively small. The correlation between simulated and observed values was very high (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). The RMSE value and EF value are 0.35 and 0.87, respectively. The RMSE value is relatively small, and the efficiency coefficient of the model is high, which indicates that the simulation value can well reflect the actual change rule of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes. In conclusion, DNDC can well simulate and predict the seasonal variation of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in this study area.
