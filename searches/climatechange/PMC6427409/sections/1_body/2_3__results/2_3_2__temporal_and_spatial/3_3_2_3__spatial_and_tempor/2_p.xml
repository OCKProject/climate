<p class="p">Under RCP 4.5, the CH

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes of each GCM in different periods was small under RCP 8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f011" class="xref">Figure 11</xref>). Under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the 2030s–2050s ranged from 12.45 kg C/ha/(10a) to 24.34 kg C/ha/(10a) and 21.11 kg C/ha/(10a) to 35.59 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 16.34 kg C/ha/(10a) and 24.09 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. The climatic tendency distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 was similar. However, the climatic tendency under RCP 8.5 was higher than that under RCP 4.5. In the 2050s–2070s period, the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 ranged from 7.31 kg C/ha/(10a) to 10.51 kg C/ha/(10a) and 20.31 kg C/ha/(10a) to 44.33 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 8.61 kg C/ha/(10a) and 28.86 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. Compared with the 2030s–2050s stage, the climatic tendency under RCP 8.5 continued to increase spatially and temporally, with a big increase in the central part, while the increase in the northern part was smaller. However, the climatic tendency under RCP 4.5 tended to decrease, and was even less than the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the historical period. The decreases in the north and west parts were larger. Overall, the spatial distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the 2030s, 2050s, and 2070s stages under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 showed a decreasing trend from west to east temporally, and showed a continuous increasing trend spatially. The climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes varied greatly in different periods. Under RCP 4.5, the climate tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux decreased, while under RCP 8.5, the climate tendency increased.
