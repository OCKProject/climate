<p class="p">Taking the mean of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from 1960 to 2015 as the background value of historical CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, the temporal and spatial variation characteristics of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the study area under future climate change were studied. From

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00692-f010" class="xref">Figure 10</xref>, it can be seen that under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes ranged from 160.00 to 318.68 kg C/ha and 167.15 to 442.07 kg C/ha between 2021–2080, with average values of 213.46 kg C/ha and 252.19 kg C/ha, respectively. Compared with historical background values, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes increased by 67.50 kg C/ha and 106.23 kg C/ha between 2021–2080 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. The average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> flux under RCP 8.5 increased more than that under RCP 4.5. The spatial distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 between the future was similar to the historical distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, and it tended to decrease from west to east. However, under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes between 2021–2080 ranged from 10.89 to 18.46 kg C/ha/(10a) and 24.21 to 44.02 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. The average climatic tendencies were 13.40 kg C/ha/(10a) and 29.86 kg C/ha/(10a), respectively. Compared with the historical climatic tendency, the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes increased by 1.52 kg C/ha/(10a) and 17.98 kg C/ha/(10a) respectively between 2021–2080 under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes under RCP 8.5 was higher than that under RCP 4.5. The spatial distribution of the climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes was different from that between 1960–2015. The climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes decreased from west to east between 2021–2080. The high-value area was mainly distributed in the west, while the low-value area was mainly distributed in the east.
