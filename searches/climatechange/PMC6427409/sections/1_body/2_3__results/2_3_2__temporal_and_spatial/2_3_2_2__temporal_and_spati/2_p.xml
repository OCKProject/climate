<p class="p">From the 1970s to the 1990s, the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes showed an increasing trend. The climatic tendency was between 9.87–13.40 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 11.42 kg C/ha/(10a). Among them, the climatic tendency in the central part was relatively low, while the climatic tendency in the eastern, southern, and western regions were relatively high. From the 1990s to the 2010s, the average climatic tendency of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes was slightly higher than that of the 1970s–1990s, and the climatic tendency was between 8.62–17.37 kg C/ha/(10a), with an average of 12.62 kg C/ha/(10a). In the eastern region, the increasing rate slowed down, while in the northern part, the increasing rate increased dramatically. The climatic tendency of the northern part was greater than 17 kg C/ha/(10a).
