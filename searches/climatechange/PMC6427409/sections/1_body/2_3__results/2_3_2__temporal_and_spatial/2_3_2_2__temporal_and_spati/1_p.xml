 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes ranged from 98.27 kg C/ha to 215.94 kg C/ha, with an average of 145.56 kg C/ha. CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the 1970s, 1990s, and 2010s were 125.80 kg C/ha, 146.42 kg C/ha, and 170.57 kg C/ha, respectively. CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission fluxes showed a decreasing trend from west to east. The high-value areas were mainly distributed in the western part with an average of more than 175 kg C/ha. The low-value areas were mainly distributes in the northern area, with an annual average value of less than 120 kg C/ha. The climatic tendency was between 8.78â€“14.43 kg C/ha/(10a) with an average of 11.88 kg C/ha/(10a). The average CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from 26 meteorological stations in the study area showed a fluctuating and increasing trend (
