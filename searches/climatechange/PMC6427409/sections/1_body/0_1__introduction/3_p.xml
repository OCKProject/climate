<p class="p">Several studies on the effects of climate factors on the spatiotemporal distributions of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields can be found in the literature, which mostly have been concentrated in Asian countries. For example, the study by Katayanagi et al. [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] indicated a decreasing trend of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission from rice paddies from north to south in Japan, considering organic carbon input, water management regimes, and the drainage rates of Japan’s seven administrative regions from 1990 to 2012. Minamikawa et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] pointed out that the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from the rice paddies of six experiment sites in central Thailand increased by different ranges, and also showed a big spatial distribution from 2001 to 2060 under four RCPs under different water management practices. In China, Li et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] found that Chinese fields emitted 6.4~12.0 Tg C per year within a continuous flooding scenario under 1990 climate land-use conditions by modeling CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions using DNDC, while southern China showed larger CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions than other parts, and in another paper, an increasing trend of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission of rice paddies in China from 2000 to 2020 by different management scenarios was also found [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. However, no big changes of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from rice fields in China between 1991–2010 was found in a study by Verburg et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Meanwhile, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] modeled CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from irrigation rice cultivation of five regions in China and predicated that the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission amount from 2010 to 2050 would increase by 1.2 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and that the increase in northeastern China was more significant than in other areas. At a smaller scale, Zhang et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] characterized the spatial dynamics of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from rice paddies of Sanjiang Plain in the years 1990, 2000, and 2010; he found that big spatial differences and annual average differences of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes existed, due to the different climate conditions between the years.
