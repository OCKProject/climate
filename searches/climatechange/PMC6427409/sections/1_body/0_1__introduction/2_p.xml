<p class="p">The CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from the paddy fields mainly depends on a series of biochemical processes in the soil such as CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> oxidation, and pathways of gas transportations such as plant-mediated transport, molecular diffusion, and ebullition [

 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. These processes are affected by many environment factors, and climatic factors are among the key controlling and driving factors [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Climate change affects CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy ecosystems by changing crop growth and the soil environment. Changes in temperature change the activity of methanogens in soil [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Different levels of rainfall change the soil moisture and aeration status, and further affect CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production and oxidation [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Increasing atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration contributes to crop biomass accumulation and provides more carbon sources for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in soil [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Changes in solar radiation will affect crop growth through crop photosynthesis, thereby affecting the crop transmission of CH

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Increased atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration due to human activities will have a greater impact on climate change in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, significant warming was estimated under different representative concentration paths (RCPs) during the 21st century by 1.3~6.1 °C [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The temperature in China was expected to increase at a rate of 0.06~0.63 °C per decade, and rainfall was also expected to increase by 0.52~1.85 per decade [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. These changes of climatic factors would definitely affect the CH
