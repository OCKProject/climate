<p class="p">In order to investigate the spatiotemporal distribution of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in the rice paddies in Heilongjiang Province, firstly, the daily meteorological data of 26 stations in Heilongjiang Province from 1960 to 2015 were used to calibrate and validate the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) dimensionality reduction meteorological model and generate the climate data for 2021â€“2080 in Heilongjiang Province under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Secondly, the DNDC model was calibrated and validated by the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes data of a site experiment, and the sensitive factors affecting CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes were analyzed by sensitivity analysis. Finally, the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes in Heilongjiang Province in the past and future under different climate scenarios were simulated by the DNDC model, and the effects of climate factors on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission fluxes were discussed. The purpose of this study was to provide a basis for the establishment of a greenhouse gas emission inventory of paddy fields in cold regions.
