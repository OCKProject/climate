<p class="p">Most of the previous studies pointed out that climate changes would cause spatiotemporal distribution changes of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields. In the large-scale studies of China, most studies tended to concentrate on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from the rice paddies of the southern areas. As a result, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in northeast China have sometimes been neglected; few papers have studied the impacts of climate change on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions through combining a global climate model (GCM) with different RCPs. Heilongjiang Province is located in the cold region of northeast China, and is sensitive to climate change [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], which will inevitably affect CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in cold regions. The rice planting area in Heilongjiang Province of China has increased greatly since the 1990s; however, changes to the rice-planting areas in other provinces of China have been relatively small. According to statistics, the rice-planting area in Heilongjiang Province increased by 249% from 1990 to 2015, reaching 3.15 Ã— 10

 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Relevant studies have shown that the suitable planting boundary of rice in Heilongjiang Province will continue to expand northward under future climate change [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, with the gradual increase of the rice-planting area in Heilongjiang Province, the study of the impacts of climate change on spatiotemporal distributions of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in Heilongjiang Province need to be introduced as a matter of concern.
