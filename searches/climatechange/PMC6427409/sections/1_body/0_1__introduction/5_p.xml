<p class="p">To date, most of the studies on CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in the cold region of Heilongjiang Province have been site experiments. These experiments revealed the mechanism of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes from paddy fields in cold regions and provided reliable data support [

 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-16-00692" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, it was difficult for these site experiments to estimate CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions over a larger area, and the temporal and spatial variation of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from paddy fields in cold regions under climate change is still unclear. Therefore, the estimation of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes must rely on the model to expand the sample number of regional CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> fluxes, and then assess the potential mitigation measures.
