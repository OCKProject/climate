<p class="p">Various adaptation measures are employed by water users to respond to climate change. The foremost adaptation strategy adopted by the study communities is crop diversification. The advantage of crop diversification is in the compensation of one crop failure by the yield of another crop. Many crops are grown at the same time on the same field. Association used for cash food are cocoa + plantain; Cocoa + cashew nut; Cocoa + cashew nut + teak. For food crops concern mainly yams, groundnut, taro, tomatoes, pepper and aubergine. The second important strategy is crop substitution. Water users are now using drought-tolerant crops to secure their occupation and income from the adversities caused by climate change. Thus, they have been replacing cocoa and coffee by hevea, cashew nut and teak. Also, long duration crops and varieties are getting replaced by short duration ones. For example, the variety of cocoa called ‘French cocoa’ has been replaced by ‘Mercedes cocoa’ promoted by ‘

 <italic class="italic">boucle du cacao</italic>’ and people are immigrating to the South East of the country. Another adaptation strategy used by the study communities is agroforestry. It concerns the use of fast-growing-species of trees in the farm. The frequent tree species are teak (
 <italic class="italic">Verbenaceae</italic>), framire (
 <italic class="italic">Terminalia ivorensis</italic>) and frake (
 <italic class="italic">Terminalia superba</italic>). A respondent states for example ‘when there is forest, there is rain and wind speed is reduced’. Bushfires and crop calendars redefinition are preventive adaptation strategies used by water users. Respondents reported that bushfires are now well regulated with the actions of local comities and non-governmental organizations (NGO) like « 
 <italic class="italic">SIN NAN SOPKA MIN</italic> » (e.g. fire made me poor). Also, crop calendars are redefined to facilitate adaptation by way of planning when to plant their crops. Time of rainfall has changed over the years, what the respondents termed as ‘untimely rainfall’ that poses much difficulty in the cultivation of crops. They usually manipulate the sowing date in accordance with the arrival of rain. Some water users rely on past rainfall patterns including the start and ending of the rainy season to form expectations and predict the rainfall patterns for the coming season. This redefinition of seasonal calendars is done most of the time in collaboration with some national agencies like ANADER (
 <italic class="italic">Agence National d’Appui au Développement Rural</italic>), FIRCA (
 <italic class="italic">Fonds Interprofessionnel pour la Recherche et le Conseil Agricoles</italic>) and SAPH (
 <italic class="italic">Société Africaine de Plantations d’Hévéa</italic>). Increasing fertilizer application and borrowing from friends and money lenders are financial adaptation strategies used by water users in the CRB. They resorted to these strategies to keep the household food secure and sometimes after they have run out of provisions from their own production. Getting money enables farmers to look for fertilizer and seeds of improved varieties.
