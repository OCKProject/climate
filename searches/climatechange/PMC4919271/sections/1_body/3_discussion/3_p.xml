<p class="p">One of the key perceived effects of changes in climate was declining in crop yield. Most of cash crops need good rainfall and their development is done to the detriment of forest areas. According to Brou (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2005</xref>), Ohouo and Obodi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2011</xref>) the rate of deforestation is one of the most important rates in the world (90 %). It is the case of cocoa which need annual rainfall between 1200 and 1500 mm (Brou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2003</xref>). Any change in such condition lead to declining in crop yield (Surre and Coomans

The recommendations for the described Cocoa swollen-shoot virus are to cut down alternative hosts. This results in a decrease of cocoa yield (Dzahini-Obiatey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2010</xref>; Domfeh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2011</xref>). The presence of mosquitoes is mainly a question of temperatures and humidity. Increased temperatures will increase occurrence of malaria. Crops destruction is increasing the cost of food because it is leading to low yields, food shortage and communities incomes declining (MICCA
