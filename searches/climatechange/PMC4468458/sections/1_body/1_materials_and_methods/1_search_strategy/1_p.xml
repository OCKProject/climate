<p class="p">The search process was conducted in electronic databases including papers published until June 2014 in ISI Web of knowledge, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar using key words of “environmental temperature,” “pregnancy,” “LBW,” “pregnancy outcome,” “climate change,” “PTB,” and a combination of them. To extract related articles in PubMed, medical subject heading was used. We considered cross-sectional, case-control, and longitudinal studies. Editorials, commentaries, and letter to editor papers were not included. The search was refined to the English language; we did not consider any time limitation. For any additional pertinent studies, the reference list of all relevant papers was screened as well.</p>
