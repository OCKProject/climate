<p class="p">This systematic review assessed the relationship of climate change to some pregnancy outcomes. Different studies have measured effects of these changes on eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio, and length of pregnancy. In general, review of studies suggested harmful effects of the climate and temperature changes on human health. It must be noted that two temperature spectrums either cold or hot influenced health. In some studies, cold weather and in other hot weather were associated with health outcomes. About cataract, the hot weather and 5Â° increase in the temperature were associated with a cataract occurrence. In the study of Catalano 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., cold weather was associated with an increase in the sex ratio and life duration of male sex in 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> year. Cold weather might produce these effects through different mechanisms including direct thermal effects, nutritional shortage and higher exposure to internal contaminants. Dadvand 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. studied hot weather or thermal stress and pregnancy length, they found that exposure to thermal stress was associated with 5 days decrease in the average pregnancy age. Secretion of oxytoxin and heat-shock proteins in results of heat stress is increased; it is recognized as one of the factors related to PTB.[
