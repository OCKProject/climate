 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the data extracted from articles included in this review. Different studies were conducted around the world including Asia, Europe, and America; most of them were from America and Europe. The studies were performed according to different methods and principles. Effects of the temperature, different seasons of fertilization time, season of childbirth, humidity and month of childbirth were assessed in these studies. Many diverse measurable outcomes were considered, e.g., eclampsia, preeclampsia, cataract, LBW, PTB, hypertension, sex ratio and length of pregnancy. Approximately all studies have reported a significant relationship between exposure variable and intended outcome. According to conducted studies, decrease in birth weight is more possible in cold months and winter. Increase in temperature was followed by increase in PTB rate. PTB was higher in exposure of the January to February months compared to March to October months.
