<p id="Par54" class="p">Search and rescue rates were calculated based on data from Public Safety Canadaâ€™s Knowledge Management System for years 2013 and 2014. More recent data was not available. Using ArcGIS spatial analysis tools, each event was joined with the closest proximal community. Incidence rates were calculated using Statistics Canada 2016 population data. The majority of search and rescue events were related to subsistence hunting and traditional travel on the land

 </sup>. High search and rescue rates were seen as being an indicator of sensitivity for a variety of reasons. Research has demonstrated that communities with high search and rescue rates likely place high demands on emergency volunteers in the community and have high volunteer burnout rates
