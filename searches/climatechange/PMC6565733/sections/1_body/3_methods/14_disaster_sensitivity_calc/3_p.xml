<p id="Par55" class="p">Data on disasters near or in communities was also used as an indicator of sensitivity. Similar to tracking of marine incidents, it was assumed that communities that had previous disasters have more hazards. While it is possible that these communities have learned and adapted to reduce risks, the tracking of past disasters is often used to assess future risks
