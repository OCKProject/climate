 </sup> and represents a key methodological challenge for developing future vulnerability indicators. Therefore, vulnerability results should be interpreted as how Inuit Nunangat airport and marine infrastructure would be affected if projected climate change were part of today’s social conditions. Hence, future changes at the sensitivity and adaptive capacity indicators would engender different vulnerability outcomes. Qualitative data were used to assist with interpretation of model outputs and development of policy relevant recommendations (
