 </sup>. This study is the first of its kind to assess Arctic climate change system vulnerability at such vast scale (over 2 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> land area) and resolution (âˆ¼25-km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) while promoting anticipatory adaptation through the identified vulnerabilities in air and marine transportation sectors. Based on our findings, we have outlined key areas needing adaptation.
