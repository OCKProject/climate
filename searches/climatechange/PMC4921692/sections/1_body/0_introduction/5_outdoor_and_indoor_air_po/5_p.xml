 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref> Most studies have suggested adverse effects of air pollution on children's lung function and respiratory symptoms. Deficits in lung function were associated with a correlated set of pollutants, including nitrogen dioxide, acid vapor, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and elemental carbon. Deficits in lung function during young adulthood may increase the risk of respiratory conditions, such as episodic wheezing that occurs during a viral infection. However, the greatest effect of pollution-related deficits may occur later in life, since reduced lung function is a strong risk factor for complications and death during adulthood.
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref> Prediction about the effects of climate change on health-related air pollution is hampered by several limits: future emissions depend on numerous factors, such as population growth, economic development, energy use, and production; current knowledge about weather effects on air pollution is still unsatisfactory; there is still a need of better emission inventories and observational datasets; long-term effects and actual enforcement of international agreements to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gases emissions (
