 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref> Environmental tobacco smoke is one of the most important risks for respiratory symptoms and diseases worldwide. The evidence is also reliable for indoor nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter, which have been associated with asthma. Whereas formaldehyde and volatile organic compounds seem to be the main pollutants in indoor settings, relevant papers on asthma are still scarce and limited to asthma and bronchitis. Molds have been associated with an increased risk of asthma and COPD.
