<p class="p">Particle pollution, vehicle exhaust, and ground-level ozone are the most important types of hazardous pollutants. Ozone is a strong oxidant that has been associated with persistent structural airway and lung tissue damage, as well as contributing to more severe symptoms of asthma and an increase in respiratory hospital admissions and deaths in Europe and the USA.
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> It is estimated that there will be an annual ozone level of &gt;1,500 ppm associated deaths by the year 2020 in the UK alone.
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> Pollution models for climate change scenarios predict an increase in ozone concentrations over large areas, while the effect on particle concentrations is less clear.
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref> The short-term effects of ozone on daily mortality and respiratory disease are extensively studied, while there is only limited documentation of long-term effects on mortality.
