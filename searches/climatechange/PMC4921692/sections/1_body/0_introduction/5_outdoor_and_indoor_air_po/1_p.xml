<p class="p">Air pollution is an alteration in the levels of quality and purity of the air due to natural or anthropogenic emissions of chemical and biological substances. It is the environmental factor with the greatest impact on respiratory health in Europe.

 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> Pollutants affecting air quality include inhalable particles. To put it simply, inhalable particles can be defined as those whose aerodynamic diameter is less than 10 µm (PM10), while fine inhalable particles are defined as less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5) and coarse inhalable particles, between 2.5 and 10 µm.
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref> The size of the particle, and surface and chemical composition of the particulate material determine the risk that exposure to this agent represents for human health. Fine particles, owing to their smaller size, penetrate deeply into the respiratory system and may affect the alveoli. Air pollutants show these effects by causing direct cellular injury or by inducing intracellular signaling pathways and transcription factors that are known to be sensitive to the oxidative stress.
