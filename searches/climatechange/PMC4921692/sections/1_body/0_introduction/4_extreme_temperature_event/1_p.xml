<p class="p">The effect of heat waves on mortality is well documented.
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref> It has been observed a rapid rise in the number of hot days and severe meteorological events,
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref> such as the 2003 and 2012 heat waves when temperatures reached or went above 35℃ degrees, resulting in excess deaths across Europe.
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref> In Europe, over 70,000 excess deaths were observed in 12 European countries in the heatwave summer of 2003. Such high summer temperatures are expected to be the norm by the middle of the century in Europe.
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref> There is evidence of an increased number of deaths and acute morbidity, especially among respiratory patients due to heat waves. For every 1℃ rise, the risk of premature death among respiratory patients is up to 6 times higher than in the rest of the population.
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> The increase in respiratory mortality (relative risk) is larger than total or cardiovascular mortality.
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref> Although the association between heat and the number of hospital admissions is less studied and less evident, admissions are also more apparent for respiratory than for cardiovascular disease.
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref> Moreover, climate scenarios for the next century predict that the warming will be associated with more frequent and more intense heat waves in wide areas of our planet with increased risk of wildfires and desertification. Heat and drought conditions contribute to wildfire risks. Smoke emissions can travel hundreds of kilometers downwind of fire areas, exposing people to a complex mixture of fine particles, ozone precursors, and other health-harming compounds

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> One recent worldwide estimate is that 339,000 deaths annually may be attributed to landscape fire smoke.
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> Respiratory and cardiovascular hospital admissions and emergency department visits increase in response to wildfire smoke exposure, strongly associated with PM levels.

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref> Drought conditions create multiple health challenges: in dry conditions, more pollen, dust, particulates, and when present, wildfire smoke which can irritate respiratory epithelium, exacerbate chronic respiratory illnesses, and asthma, and increase risks for acute respiratory infection (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref> In urban areas, the effects are higher because climate change influences outdoor air pollution because the generation and dispersion of air pollution is in strict correlation with local patterns of temperature, wind, and precipitation.
