<p class="p">As stated in the recent Working Group I Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, "most of the observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations."

A recent position statement on climate change and health impacts from the European Respiratory Society (ERS) was developed after a workshop co-organized by the HENVINET Project and the American Thoracic Society.
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> The position statement highlights climate-related health impacts, including deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory events due to higher concentrations of ground-level ozone; changes in the frequency of respiratory diseases due to transboundary particle pollution; and altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, moulds, and mites) and some infectious disease vectors. According to the report, these impacts will not only affect those with existing respiratory disease but likely increase the incidence and prevalence of respiratory conditions.
