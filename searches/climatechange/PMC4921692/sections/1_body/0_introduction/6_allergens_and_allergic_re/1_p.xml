<p class="p">The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still unclear, and studies addressing this topic are lacking. Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to respiratory infections and/or cold air inhalation on the other.
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref> Data provided by 30 years of observations within the International Phenological Gardens Network showed that spring events advanced by 6 days, the highest rate of phenological changes being observed in Western Europe and Baltic regions. Conversely, phenological trends appear to be different in the eastern border of Europe, sometimes showing a 1-2 weeks later start of the phases. Due to the earlier onset, the pollen seasons are more often interrupted by adverse weather conditions in late winter/early spring.

 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref> Duration of the pollen season is also extended, especially in summer and in late flowering species. The climate change projected during next century will influence plant and fungal reproductive systems and alter the timing, production, and distribution of aeroallergens. Increased exposure to allergens as a result of global warming, combined with exposure to pollutants that act synergistically to intensify the allergic response, could point to increased respiratory problems in the future. In fact, climate change is likely to influence vegetation, with consequent changes in growth and reproductive cycles and in the production of allergenic pollen (seasonal period and intensity). In addition, weed species are expected to proliferate. These changes can vary from one region to another, since some areas receive greater amounts of UV radiation and/or rainfall than others (
