<p class="p">An increasing body of evidence shows the occurrence of severe asthma epidemics during thunderstorms in the pollen season, several epidemics of asthma have been reported following thunderstorms in various geographical zones, prevalently in Europe and Australia.
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref> Asthma epidemics related to thunderstorms are limited to seasons when there are high atmospheric concentrations of airborne allergenic pollens (subjects with pollen allergy who stay indoors with the window closed during thunderstorms are not involved); further there are no observations on the involvement of asthma in nonallergic subjects. Much remains to be discovered about the relationship between asthma attacks and thunderstorms, but there is reasonable evidence in favor of a causal link between them in patients suffering from pollen allergy. In particular, during the first phase of a thunderstorm, that is, the first 20-30 minutes, there is evidence of high respirable allergen loadings in the air. This is due to dry updrafts that, during thunderstorms, entrain whole pollens into the high humidity at the cloud base where pollens may rupture and cold downdrafts carry pollen fragments (pollen grains are too large to penetrate the deeper airways) to the ground level where outflows distribute them. Due to strong electric fields that develop during thunderstorms, positive ions are released from the ground and could attach to particles and/or electric charge may enhance pollen rupture, thus enhancing bronchial hyperresponsiveness.
