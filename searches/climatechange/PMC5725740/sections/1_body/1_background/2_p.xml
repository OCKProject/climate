<p id="Par6" class="p">The geographic distribution of VBDs is influenced by a complex dynamic of environmental and social factors and their changing impact on the transmission and burden of VBDs through effects on their vectors, intermediate hosts and reservoirs. Current changes in the long-term trends of regional weather patterns, referred to as ‘climate change’, are adding new pressures to VBDs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. The impacts are anticipated to be significant, in terms of VBDs-related hazards, vulnerabilities and exposure. There is existing evidence to suggest that climate change impacts will substantially increase burdens on those people that are already vulnerable to climate extremes, such as those in the African continent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>], notably the drylands in the sub-Saharan region. Already this region is bearing the brunt of the disease burden due to VBDs and yet this region is also challenged by environmental changes, including climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>], which are perceived to induce multiple threats to development in the African continent. With climate change adding new pressure on already fragile ecosystems and populations, the African continent may face increased threats from VBDs since important disease vectors/intermediate hosts (e.g. insects, snails) depend on water and other environmental factors. Increasingly scarce water sources concentrate people and animals in specific locations, which can become hotspots for VBD transmission.
