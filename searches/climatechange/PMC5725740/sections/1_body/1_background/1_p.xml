<p id="Par5" class="p">Diseases transmitted to humans by vectors (mosquitoes, flies, sandflies, triatomine bugs, ticks, fleas, snails, etc.) such as malaria, dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus, lymphatic filariasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever, tick-borne encephalitis, typhus, Lyme disease, human African trypanosomiasis, onchocerciasis and schistosomiasis account for 17% of all infectious diseases and remain significant public health problems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. More than half of the worldâ€™s population are at risk of vector-borne diseases (VBDs); each year, more than a billion people are infected and 1 million people die from these diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Aside from deaths, many VBDs also cause considerable debilitation and suffering of affected populations. Through the years, great strides have been recorded towards combatting VBDs, most notably through large scale and coordinated control programmes, which have contributed to the decline of the global mortality attributed to VBDs. However, the health- and socio-economic impacts of VBDs, especially among vulnerable populations that are already facing the challenges of extensive poverty, fragile ecosystems, high population growth and non-existent, sub-optimal or failing health and social security systems, continue to be of grave concern.
