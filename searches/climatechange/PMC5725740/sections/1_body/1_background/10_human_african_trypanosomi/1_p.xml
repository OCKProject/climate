<p id="Par20" class="p">There is a scarcity of detailed biological data that can be used to assess the dependence of the vector and the disease on climatic parameters and how changes in climatic parameters are liable to affect the disease situation. This research project used the unique archives of data and augmented this by additional data from field investigations of man-fly and man-disease contact in Zimbabwe and Tanzania, to understand the spatio-temporal variability of disease threat and how this would likely change at different locations and altitudes in the context of climate change. This project had shown that farmers in western Tanzania are unfamiliar with the transmission of trypanosomiasis and can thus benefit from training, especially on the use of Restricted Application of Pyrethroid (RAP) insecticides as a cost-effective control method [

Tsetse populations were observed to be sensitive to climatological changes and therefore, it is imperative that climate variables be monitored together with monitoring of vector population levels and the presence of trypanosomes in the tsetse vectors and mammalian hosts [
