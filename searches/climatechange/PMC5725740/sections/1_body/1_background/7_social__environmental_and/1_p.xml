<p id="Par15" class="p">This project, undertaken in specific vulnerable communities in arid areas of Botswana, South Africa and Zimbabwe, had sought to determine the impacts of socio-economic, environmental, climatic, bionomic and institutional factors on malaria and schistosomiasis. This project had demonstrated, through a community engagement framework (involving active participation of community members together with researchers and public health practitioners) [

This project was also able to apply Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing tools, used at micro-geographic scale, to locally identify local hotspots for schistosomiasis transmission [
