<p id="Par17" class="p">This project had shown that, while there is good knowledge of malaria in the community, the confounding myths and misconceptions may adversely influence treatment-seeking behaviour and effective control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Non-adherence to malaria medication may also lead to drug resistance and other adverse side effects. Given the just confirmed perennial transmission of malaria and a high rate of asymptomatic cases in the riverine zone, there is potential for the emergence of transmission hot spots. There is thus a need for routine surveillance, appropriate management of the disease, particularly among primary school children, and expansion of malaria control initiatives into emerging hot spots such as the riverine zone. Mosquito net coverage is not adequate and the utilization is not optimal and can be improved. Populations living in mud-walled grass-thatched houses with open eaves are at highest risk of malaria infections in indoor environments. Finally, where microscopic examination is unavailable, Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs) provide alternative cost effective, accurate and rapid detection of malaria.
