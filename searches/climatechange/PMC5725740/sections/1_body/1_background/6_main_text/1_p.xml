<p id="Par10" class="p">Five projects comprise the TDR IDRC Research Initiative (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> for a list of projects). The projects, led by researchers from research institutions in Botswana, Cote d’Ivoire, Kenya, Mauritania, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, and in collaboration with existing disease control programmes in the context of the National Adaptation Plans for Climate Change (NAPs) in Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>], were focused on addressing malaria, schistosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis and Rift Valley fever. The projects provided a holistic research perspective to elucidate how environmental and socio-economic change affects transmission dynamics and disease burden of VBDs through changes in vector ecology, human ecology, social organization, demography and health systems. Vulnerability and resilience of specified socio-ecological systems (SES) were assessed based on multi- and transdisciplinary models and frameworks. In addition, social and health systems research were expected to illuminate and analyse community structures, dynamics and resilience, health systems performance and response to VBDs in the broader multisectoral stakeholder context.
