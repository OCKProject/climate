<p id="Par12" class="p">Capacity building is central to this research initiative. A Special Project Team was established to provide scientific and technical guidance to the research teams for the implementation of their research projects. Capacity building efforts (for research, ethics and gender-based data analysis), targeting research teams, communities, public health practitioners and those from the environment sector, were advanced through workshops and training courses. A web-based platform, vbd-environment.org, was specifically developed for knowledge-sharing and for dissemination of information..Other training opportunities were also available to support students at the Masters, PhD and post-doctoral levels (59 students total; 56% men and 44% women).</p>
