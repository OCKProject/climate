<p id="Par13" class="p">Research uptake is key in facilitating the use of research evidence by stakeholders which include communities, policy makers, practitioners and other relevant partners. Early and continuous engagement with stakeholders was at the core of the projectsâ€™ implementation process. A Research Uptake Meeting held last April 2017, in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo at the WHO Regional Office for Africa, was one of several notable occasions that provided a venue to engage research teams and their respective sectoral partners (from the ministries of health and environment) to discuss draft policy briefs based on emerging evidence and knowledge from the research projects. This meeting laid the groundwork for future continued engagement that is expected to promote a comprehensive, integrated and multisectoral approach to increasing resilience to VBDs under climate change conditions. During this meeting, the ministry officials from the health and environment sectors had acknowledged the usefulness of research towards contributing to further improvement of the implementation of VBD control programmes and for informing/updating the national health and environment strategic plans.</p>
