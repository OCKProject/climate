<p id="Par21" class="p">Using the ecohealth approach, this research project aimed to develop, through a community participatory approach, tools and appropriate coping strategies to alleviate the effects of climate change on the transmission of malaria and schistosomiasis. This project had shown that education, social support and governance have a strong impact in building community resilience to VBDs. There was a clear association between rainfall and temperature with the transmission of malaria and schistosomiasis which can inform planning and prioritization of resource allocation for a more effective implementation of VBD control programmes [
