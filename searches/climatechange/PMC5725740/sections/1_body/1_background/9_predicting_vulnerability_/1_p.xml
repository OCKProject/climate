<p id="Par19" class="p">The goal of this project was to use climate and land use models to predict potential hotspots of infection with African trypanosomiasis. This project had shown that African trypanosomiasis remains as a disease of public health importance affecting animals and humans in the Maasai steppe in Tanzania. In this project, it was observed that majority of pastoralists are aware of the animal form of trypanosomiasis; however, knowledge of Human African trypanosomiasis is poor. The changing climate is a major driver of the abundance of tsetse flies and their infection rates. Habitats, vegetation and host availability are strong predictors of tsetse abundance infection rates [

 <bold class="bold">.</bold> The presence of reservoirs, anthropo-zoonotic feeding behavior of tsetse flies and changing climate can potentially result in the resurgence of human African trypanosomiasis. It is therefore important to establish monitoring and surveillance, especially within the human-animal interface areas of the Maasai steppe.
