<p id="Par22" class="p">VBDs continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we have presented the TDR-IDRC Research Initiative on VBDs and Climate Change as an example of a research portfolio that can contribute to a broader, transdisciplinary, holistic systems-approach to research [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>] leading to a better understanding of the population health vulnerabilities to vector-borne diseases and towards increasing resilience under climate change conditions in Africa. It is expected that the TDR-IDRC research portfolio will add new knowledge and evidence on VBD impacts under climate change conditions on vulnerable populations, which, in turn may inform the development of practical frameworks, processes and tools for policy-decision making for better risk management and for building on existing VBD control strategies to come up with innovative approaches. This portfolio also is also expected to contribute to building African capacity for transdisciplinary policy-oriented research. The transdisciplinary approach (from conception to organization and to implementation of research projects) is expected to provide an enabling milieu for a process of mutual learning and exchange that involves shareholders and important societal actors (e.g. relevant decision-makers, affected local communities) to transform health concerns into finding solutions together [
