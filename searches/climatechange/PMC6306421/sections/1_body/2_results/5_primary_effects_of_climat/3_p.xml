<p id="Par29" class="p">Weather-related accidents were predicted to either decrease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>] or increase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. Based on the interviews, the risk for accidents has increased among reindeer herders. Changes in the carrying capacity of ice, snow quality, and formation are likely to increase the risk for transport-related accidents and in the mountain region risk for avalanches can increase. Based on available knowledge, the primary health effects of climate change are likely to increase among Saami reindeer herders. Saami reindeer-herding models differ regionally and vary from semi-nomadic to local, and effects of climate change and adaptation possibilities thus vary significantly. Based on available evidence, it is not possible to estimate how the climate change influences different reindeer-herding models. Climate change is estimated to have both negative and positive effects for reindeer herding. However, the net balance is likely to vary significantly regionally depending on geography, local climate, environment, adaptation and mitigation measures, competing land uses, social system, and Saami population, reindeer-herding models, governance, and socioeconomic factors.
