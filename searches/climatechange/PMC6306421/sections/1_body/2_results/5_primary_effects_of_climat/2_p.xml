Climate change increases the risk of wildfires that have negative health effects and result loss of pasture land. Climate change is projected to threaten the lichen ecosystems in high latitudes and increases competition with other vegetation, especially vascular plants [

Changes in precipitation, increased heat stress, insect harassment, and changes in snow conditions in winter have an effect on predation and reindeer population dynamics [
