<p id="Par48" class="p">Comparison of the health and well-being of Saami to the health of other indigenous people is possible only at a general level. Comprehensive population-based studies and registry-based data are missing—in Nordic countries ethnic registries are forbidden—and hence, even the definition of a Saami is being disputed. The most comprehensive overview on the health of indigenous and tribal people was published in 2016. The study used general indicators—such as life expectancy and infant mortality—available from registries, excluding morbidity and mental health. The analysis shows that direct comparison of health of indigenous peoples is not possible, because of different status and legal interpretation of indigenousness, differences in data collection methods and indicators and lack of standardization of different methods [

However, it can be argued that based on available evidence, the health of Saami is relatively good or better when compared on a general level to other indigenous peoples globally, but overview on cultural well-being and metal health of Saami is missing. More research and development of a monitoring system are needed to understand the health and cultural well-being of Saami in changing climate taking into consideration Saami values and traditions and major drivers for change.
