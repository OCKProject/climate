 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>] but it is possible that socioeconomic and lifestyle changes have negative effects on adaptive capacity. Our analysis suggests that the lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami is changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for both the physical and mental health of the Saami, increasing general morbidity, and making them more vulnerable to the adverse health effects of climate change. Changes in lifestyle and diet expose Saami to cardiovascular disease. Increased climate change-related heat exposure is associated with an increase in cardiac events and especially elderly are vulnerable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>]. We have identified that the livelihood changes may have direct effects on the physical health and cultural well-being of the Saami, which need to studied further and taken into consideration in governance.
