Of the more than 2000 survey respondents, 183 said that they did not know whether they and their household were vulnerable to the health effects of climate change. Those who are at higher health risk from climate change—such as those with medical conditions, women, and people from communities of color—are more likely to say they know whether they are at risk. A number of characteristics not associated with greater risk—knowledge (level of education, and information about state climate health impacts) and income—also decrease the likelihood that someone will say they do not know whether they and their household are at risk from the health effects of climate change.
