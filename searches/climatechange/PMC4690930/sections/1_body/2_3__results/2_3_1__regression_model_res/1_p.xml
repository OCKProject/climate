<p class="p">As hypothesized, the covariates—general health risk perceptions and political ideology—account for a sizeable percentage of the variance in perceptions of vulnerability to climate health harms, 25% (adj. R

Also as hypothesized, climate beliefs—certainty that climate change is occurring and an understanding of specific climate change health risks in Maryland—also greatly contribute to the explanatory capacity of the model, almost doubling it to 48%. The additional explanatory power of variables representing social vulnerability and hazard exposure is comparatively low, yielding an additional 3 percentage points in adjusted R
