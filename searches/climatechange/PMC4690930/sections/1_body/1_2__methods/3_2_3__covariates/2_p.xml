 <italic class="italic">Perceived general health risk.</italic> In order to account for overall differences in risk perception levels, we utilized regression scores from a six-item factor analysis of respondents’ perceived risk from general threats to their health and wellbeing, including second-hand smoke, air pollution, obesity, flu epidemics, chemicals, and polluted water (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-12-14994-t007" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). In the exploratory factor analysis, one component explained 45% of the variance across the six variables. The communalities—percent variance of the variables explained by the extraction—are 0.42, 0.51, 0.30, 0.51, 0.58, and 0.40 respectively. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy is 0.84, above the recommended threshold of 0.6, and Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity, testing the equivalence of the variances, is statistically significant (
