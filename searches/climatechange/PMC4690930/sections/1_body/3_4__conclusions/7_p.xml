 <italic class="italic">Limitations.</italic> The strengths of this study are in the sampleâ€™s wide representation of political beliefs and its use of secondary data in combination with survey responses. However, surveys often do not sufficiently reach individuals who are at higher levels of vulnerability [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], and respondents are more likely to be civically engaged than those who do not participate [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-12-14994" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. These conditions reflect the limitations of this study as well. Moreover, the ecology of vulnerability is complex and threat-specific; the measures in this study reflect only broad indicators. The factors for extreme heat vulnerability among the socially vulnerable have been recently explored in detail, calling attention to the importance of social and environmental conditions as well as individual characteristics [
