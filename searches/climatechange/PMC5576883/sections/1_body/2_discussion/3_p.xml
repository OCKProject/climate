<p class="p">A comprehensive set of high-resolution process-based watershed models developed for Jordan and southern Syria proved to be essential to quantifying the effect of future climate change on Jordan through drought impacts within its boundaries and in upstream Syria. Comparing Jordanâ€™s surface water resources today to those under climate change at the end of the century, our hydrologic simulation results suggest a reduction of 40% (204 to 122 MCM under RCP8.5) in total streamflow generated from all major watersheds. Drought within Jordan accounts for 56% of this decline, with the remaining 44% due to transboundary drought effects in Syria, assuming that agricultural land use reverts to historical pre-conflict conditions after 2025. The cascading effect of soil moisture deficit in Syria on this decline in streamflow to Jordan is 31% (26 MCM/year) because the upstream river flow is diverted to supply irrigated agriculture, thereby reducing transboundary flow to the south.</p>
