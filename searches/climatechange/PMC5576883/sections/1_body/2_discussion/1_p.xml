<p class="p">Water security assessments spanning future decades would greatly benefit from reflecting on the joint impacts of multiple drought types and human-induced land-use change. These impacts are especially worth considering for the 278 transboundary waterways (

Future water security concerns are critical in arid countries reliant on transboundary freshwater resources and where the combined effects of future droughts and human-induced land-use changes are likely to continue. We quantify these combined effects of land-use change and future climate change–induced precipitation (meteorological drought) on streamflow (hydrologic drought) and irrigated land (agricultural drought). Although our analyses focus on Jordan and its upstream riparian neighbor, Syria, where land use has changed markedly since 2013 (

  <italic class="italic">31</italic>
 </xref>), our approach is highly relevant to other countries in which regional and global changes might produce similar cumulative impacts on water resources and agricultural land.
