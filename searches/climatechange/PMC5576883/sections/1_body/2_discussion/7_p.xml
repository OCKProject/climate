<p class="p">Future freshwater sustainability in Jordan will likely be threatened by increased future water consumption generated by an increasing population and refugee influxes, following a punctuated population growth pattern observed since 1948. Future adaptation to extreme droughts in Jordan will be an immense challenge. The projected negative impacts of more severe droughts of greater duration calls for essential alternatives, such as fresh water supplied by desalination associated with the Red Sea–Dead Sea project and improved transboundary water-sharing agreements with neighboring countries. Regional cooperation among riparian countries resulted in an agreement signed by Jordan, Israel, and the Palestinian Authority. This agreement enables the Red Sea–Dead Sea pilot project to move forward and, along with potential future full implementation of the project, is an essential positive step toward beginning to alleviate water scarcity through mid-century. However, given worsening hydrologic and agricultural droughts, transboundary river flow that depends on Syrian agricultural land use, refugee-driven population growth, and groundwater depletion, enormous obstacles remain for Jordan to achieve a secure and sustainable freshwater supply.</p>
