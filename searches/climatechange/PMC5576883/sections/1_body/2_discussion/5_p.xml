<p class="p">Second, we analyze future meteorological droughts but go beyond that to consider agricultural droughts (soil moisture deficit) and hydrologic droughts (decline in streamflow). Assessment of agricultural and hydrologic droughts was based on a set of high-resolution regional data-driven process-based watershed models covering 95% of both the populated area and agricultural regions of Jordan. For all three drought types, we quantify temporal behavior of drought occurrence duration, frequency severity, and concurrence of events. Our results suggest (i) the emergence of a drier, hotter future climate with consequent declines of 30% in precipitation, 28% in soil moisture, and 58% in streamflow during the late century (2070–2100) that fall well outside the climatological conditions experienced during the baseline historical period (1981–2010); (ii) that the concurrence of all three drought types during the late century increases to 27 and 47 monthly events (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from only 2 concurrent events during the baseline period; (iii) that the average variance of all three drought types during the late century is ~35% lower than the variance during the baseline period, which is likely due to the occurrence of far fewer wet events; (iv) that the two largest dammed reservoirs in Jordan are likely to see a reduction in annual inflow of 31 and 65%, respectively, by late century; and (v) that spatial and temporal drought analyses indicate that the northern basins, which contain most of Jordan’s population and agricultural activities, are twice as likely to experience either agricultural or hydrologic droughts by the end of the 21st century under extreme climate change compared to the baseline.</p>
