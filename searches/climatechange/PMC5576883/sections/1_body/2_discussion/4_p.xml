<p class="p">Our work advances methods and understanding of the evolution of multiple drought types under future climate scenarios that cause reductions in freshwater supply in critically dry Jordan, which is also affected by upstream riparian land-use change. First, we present a systematic assessment of the baseline historical period behavior of climate models for drought analysis as an essential step for strategic selection of a realistic subset of future model projections. Our approach eliminates the most implausible models for this regionâ€”those that do not reproduce the historical precipitation record. Of the 10 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) climate models, only 3 met statistical criteria for acceptability and are the only ones consistent with both the selection criteria and ENSO behavior. The selected models were shown to be consistent with the latter portion of the historical record not used in the model culling process. Models that were inconsistent with the historical precipitation data remained so during the consistency-check period. Although this check period was brief, it was one showing a sudden marked drought.</p>
