<p class="p">From a broad perspective, our results suggest that climate change analyses focusing only on precipitation deficit in transboundary flow systems underestimate potential impacts in water-stressed regions for two reasons. First, although the effect of declining precipitation is no doubt the major driving factor for all three types of droughts considered in the Jordan-Syria system, declines in streamflow and soil moisture, which are critical to freshwater supply and agriculture, are driven not only by lower precipitation but also by significantly higher temperature and evapotranspirative demand plus land-use change. Second, downstream riparian nations are extremely susceptible to the cascading impacts of multiple drought types. For example, streamflow in a downstream nation (such as Jordan) may decline because of the drought there, but flow can also further diminish because of the impact of meteorological drought in the upstream riparian nation plus the indirect effect on runoff suppression in the upstream riparian nation (for example, Syria) due to soil moisture deficit (agricultural drought) and consequent increases in irrigation demand.</p>
