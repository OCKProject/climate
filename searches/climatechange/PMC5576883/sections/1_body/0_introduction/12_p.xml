<p class="p">The effect of Syrian conflict on Syrian land use and transboundary flow in the Yarmouk River, and subsequent impact on Jordan, was the topic of a recent remote sensing and statistical analysis (

 </xref>). Our investigation builds upon and differs from that effort as we analyze the combined impacts of climate change and the Syrian conflict on transboundary river flow from Syria to Jordan during the remainder of the 21st century, by relying on simulations of hydrologic processes rather than statistical analysis only applied to the historical period. We analyze two post-conflict scenarios affecting Yarmouk flow: (i) “continuing conflict” is the case in which Syria continues in a state of reduced irrigated agriculture due to conflict, fewer farmers, and disrepair of irrigation infrastructure, and (ii) “recovery to pre-conflict status” wherein, after 2025, Syria returns to its prewar state of irrigated agriculture. In both cases, Jordan receives a small fraction (about one-third) of transboundary flow than it relied upon in the prewar period 1980–2010. In addition, in both cases, the changes in upstream agricultural water use are quantified using our hydrologic model, which accounts for changes in agricultural land-use patterns and Syrian reservoir releases.
