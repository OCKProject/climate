<p class="p">All of these previous studies restricted their analyses to meteorological droughts (low precipitation). However, droughts affecting agriculture and river flow have serious and often longer-lasting impacts on both food and water security, although these problems typically follow the onset of meteorological droughts. Merely considering meteorological drought as an indicator of freshwater and agricultural vulnerability provides an incomplete picture that may be too optimistic. Jordan cannot afford to be overly sanguine about the devastating consequences of droughts given preexisting regional vulnerabilities due to conflicts, immigration, dependence on transboundary river flow, and limited mitigation options (
