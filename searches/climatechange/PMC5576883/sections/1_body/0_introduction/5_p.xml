<p class="p">Syrian water use and its numerous dams that capture flow in the Yarmouk basin are of particular importance because they have critical influences on reducing river discharge that remains for Jordan and Israel. However, it is noteworthy that Israel, Jordan, and the Palestinian Authority overcame political obstacles in transboundary water allocation by signing a bilateral agreement green-lighting the construction of a Red Sea–Dead Sea pilot water transfer program, with desalinated water transferred to Israel in exchange for additional water provided to Jordan to supply Amman. Full execution of the Red-Dead program beyond the pilot stage is the next-step essential option to partially alleviate some of the stress imposed by the current and future water demands in Jordan. Recently, pressure on Jordan’s freshwater resources has stemmed from a sudden population increase during 2011–2015 in large measure due to its rapid acceptance of more than 1.3 million refugees, of which 1 million were Syrian, compared to a native Jordanian population of 8.2 million (

Given the crucial role of Jordan in maintaining the stability of the Middle East and the threat to the nation’s water security, we present an analysis of the potential impacts of future droughts and climate change on the nation’s freshwater resources. We then explore the additional future potential impact of Syrian land-use change as a result of recovery from the ongoing war as it affects transboundary river flow to Jordan.
