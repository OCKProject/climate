<p class="p">Our analysis relies only on those particular regional climate model results that satisfactorily reproduce historical precipitation measurements and are consistent with El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) behavior (table S1). The hydrologic simulations of each basin in Jordan (including one major basin extending into southern Syria) provide estimates of the duration, frequency of occurrence, and severity of agricultural and hydrologic droughts. These hydrologic simulations were then aggregated by averaging over the study region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) to provide a general quantitative picture of drought evolution in significantly populated Jordan and southern Syria. Spatial impacts on flow in rivers and soil moisture deficit throughout Jordan showing the drought impacts in each region are presented in Results.
