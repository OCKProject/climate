<p class="p">The effects of global climate change are known to have important, often adverse consequences on regional environmental security as well as on social well-being, conflict, and transboundary migrations, especially water security in arid regions. The time scale of these changes, however, is sufficient to allow transformations of land use and transboundary river flows, both of which are sensitive to the nature of droughts and pose challenges to freshwater management. The distributional conflicts over transboundary waters will intensify in the future due to increasing water needs as populations compete for ever-dwindling resources. This is significant in arid regions and, more specifically, in the Middle East, where the added pressure of climate change on limited water resources is further exacerbated by anthropogenic disasters. The coupled effects of climate changeâ€“induced droughts and conflict-induced land-use changes on transboundary waters are often left unexplored.</p>
