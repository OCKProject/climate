<p class="p">Second, we investigate the combined impact of climate change–induced future hydrologic droughts and land-use changes in upstream Syria on Jordanian water resources. The Yarmouk River lies in a major transboundary basin shared with Syria and is the largest tributary to the Jordan River (Yarmouk-Jordan River system). This is important because significant transboundary flow in the Yarmouk River from Syria has served as a major freshwater source for Jordan Valley agriculture and public supply for Amman, Jordan’s largest city. For decades, Syria has built dams to retain water and used the Yarmouk basin’s surface water for agricultural irrigation, allowing little flow to reach its downstream neighbor, Jordan (
