<p class="p">Here, we investigate two key aspects of Jordanâ€™s freshwater vulnerability related to droughts. First, we consider multiple manifestations of future high temperature in conjunction with low precipitation by exploring three types of drought: meteorological drought reflecting a decline in precipitation, agricultural drought representing the deficit in soil moisture (soil water under nondeficit conditions is required for crops), and hydrologic drought as measured by reduced streamflow. The latter two drought types indicate the potential additional manifestations of precipitation deficit, rising temperature, and land-use change. To quantify the effects of agricultural and hydrologic droughts that directly affect Jordan under climate change, we simulate rainfall-runoff processes in each major drainage basin in the country based on future projections of temperature and precipitation obtained from regional climate models. We consider two climate change scenarios: RCP4.5 (optimistic case) and RCP8.5 (business as usual).</p>
