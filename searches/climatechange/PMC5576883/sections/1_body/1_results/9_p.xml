<p class="p">Under RCP4.5, Jordan is likely to experience a gradual decline in the occurrence of extremely wet months. Compared to the baseline period, under RCP4.5, the chance of occurrence of an extreme precipitation event (&gt;2 SD) reduces by 85%, and the chance of occurrence of a severe precipitation event (&gt;1.5 SD) reduces by 73% during 2071â€“2100 (fig. S1). The effect of increased warming and the subsequent reduction of the wet events in the case of soil moisture and streamflow are experienced at a slower pace, and even under RCP8.5, the region is likely to see months with streamflow and soil moisture values higher than 1.5 to 2 SD, until 2070 (
