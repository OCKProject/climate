<p class="p">Although inconsistent climate variability across independent climate models or between models and observations is not surprising (
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">33</italic>
 </xref>), we find that the variance of the future projections of the multimodel mean is ~35% smaller than that in precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow during the baseline period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figs. 1</xref>, C and D, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>, A to D). The decline in variance is more evident in RCP8.5, which is consistent with significantly lower occurrence of wet events under this scenario. This reduced variance does not appear to be due to bias correction as suggested by a 5-year period (2011â€“2015), during which we validated the bias-corrected precipitation versus observed precipitation (
