<p class="p">Droughts are multi-attribute events characterized by properties such as duration, frequency of occurrence, and severity. We quantify droughts on a monthly time scale in terms of levels of SD from the baseline average, with each sequential level reflecting a greater drought magnitude. If, for each drought type, the variable of interest (precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow) falls below −1 SD from the baseline average for a continuous period of one or more months, then it is defined as a drought event. Drought frequency of occurrence during a 30-year period is reported as the number of months of drought events. As an annual summary, we also report the number of dry years in each 30-year period with annual precipitation, average soil moisture, and average streamflow falling below −1 SD from the baseline annual average. The duration of a drought event is the number of months during which the monthly deviation falls below −1 SD from the baseline average. Severity of each drought event reflects its magnitude and is the sum of monthly SD levels falling below −1 SD. We present results for all four 30-year time periods in our figures. These figures show the progression of climate impacts on droughts over the century. Our comparison of the 2071–2100 end of century period to the 1981–2010 baseline period illustrates how drought properties are likely to change with (RCP4.5) and without (RCP8.5) climate change policy intervention (
