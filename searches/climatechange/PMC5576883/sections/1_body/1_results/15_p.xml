<p class="p">Jordan receives water from the Yarmouk River, the largest and most important tributary of the Jordan River, with an annual average flow of around 400 to 500 MCM (

 </xref>). Flow into Jordan is controlled by the Al-Wehda dam. The Al-Wehda reservoir not only is the nationâ€™s largest with a capacity of 110 MCM but also is located at the Jordan-Syria border and serves as the centerpiece of the 1987 transboundary water-sharing agreement between the two nations. However, since the construction of Al-Wehda dam in 2005, the annual flow into the reservoir steadily declined from 150 to 15 MCM by 2011. This is largely due to the increase in upstream water use and diversions via a number of Syrian dams and reservoirs, the development of which ran counter to the intent of various water treaties with Jordan. The transition period from 2006 to 2011 is important because it represents the time after which the Al-Wehda dam officially started functioning in accordance with the Jordan-Syria water agreement of 1987 and right before the decline in agricultural land use following the onset of the Syrian crisis. The reservoir inflows started rising in 2013, which can be attributed to the (i) recent Syrian uprising that led to a decline in the irrigated land in the Syrian portion of the Yarmouk basin and (ii) recovery from a multiyear drought (
