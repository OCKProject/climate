<p class="p">1) The continuing conflict scenario represents the best-case scenario for Jordan in terms of receiving transboundary flow from Syria. Under reduced Syrian agriculture and moderate climate change impacts represented by RCP4.5, our hydrologic simulations suggest an average inflow of 62 MCM/year to the Al-Wehda reservoir during 2016–2050. Even under this best-case future scenario, Jordan is likely to experience 51% less inflow compared to what it received during the baseline historical period (127 MCM/year during 1981–2010). Groundwater formerly fed the Yarmouk River, but excessive groundwater abstraction in Syria (
