<p class="p">1) The reduction in flow to Jordan caused by the recovery in southern Syrian agriculture is twice that due to climate change. In this context, by “reduction” in flow, we mean the difference in flow caused by either (i) the different climate scenarios while keeping the land-use scenario constant or (ii) the different land-use change scenarios while keeping the climate scenario constant. To specifically consider the independent impact of conflict-driven reduction in Syrian agricultural land use on inflows to Jordan, we take the difference in flows between the scenarios RCP8.5 continuing conflict scenario and RCP8.5 recovery to pre-conflict scenario, and the difference between RCP4.5 continuing conflict scenario and RCP4.5 recovery to pre-conflict scenario. In this case, we find that, during 2026–2050, there is an average annual decline of 26 and 20 MCM in inflow from Syria to Jordan under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. However, looking at the effect of climate change alone on flow generation, we see that the average decline in annual flow generation is only 15 and 8 MCM under the continuing conflict and recovery to pre-conflict scenarios, respectively.</p>
