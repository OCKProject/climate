<p class="p">The consistent negative shift in the probability distributions for all three types of droughts under future scenarios suggests a higher level of aridity and drought persistence. First, for meteorological drought, the mean of both RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 PDFs shows a shift toward drier conditions and a decline in variance as reflected in the relatively flatter right tail in comparison to the PDF for the baseline period, indicating a lower probability of occurrence of wet events. Second, for agricultural drought, the PDF for RCP4.5 has an elongated right (wet) tail, with a slight negative shift in the mean and a higher variance when compared to the baseline period PDF (

Under RCP4.5, the probability of the region experiencing near-normal soil moisture conditions is similar to the baseline period, with a slightly higher probability of occurrence of both dry and wet extreme events. The density function for agricultural droughts under RCP8.5 has a negative shift in the mean and lower variance when compared to RCP4.5 and the baseline period, thus indicating the possible need for higher irrigation requirements in the future. Third, the hydrologic drought density functions for RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 experience a moderate shift toward the drier side, although to a lesser extent when compared to meteorological and agricultural droughts. The variance for the baseline period and future scenarios is quantified for all three drought types and agrees with the above inferences (
