<p class="p">Results for the “business-as-usual” case show a significant increase in drought occurrence and severity. For meteorological drought, we find that the number of years that receive annual precipitation less than −1 SD from the baseline period progressively increases from 7 of 30 years (7 years in 1981–2010 or 23% of years) in the baseline period to 28 of 30 years (94% of years) during 2071–2100. Similarly, although the baseline period did not experience a precipitation deficit that falls below −2 SD, 15 of the 30 years (50% of years) during 2071–2100 are likely to experience extreme precipitation deficit, falling below −2 SD (

The number of years with annual soil moisture deficit falling below −1 SD increases from 6 (20% of years) during 1981–2010 to 23 years during 2071–2100 (76% of years), with only 1 of 30 years (3% of years) seeing an extreme soil moisture deficit (

Similarly, a streamflow deficit that falls below −1 SD progressively increases from 9 years during the baseline period (30% of years) to 25 years during 2071–2100 (86% of years). The number of years likely to experience an extreme streamflow deficit increases from zero during the baseline period to two during 2071–2100 (7% of years) (
