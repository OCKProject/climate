<p class="p">2) The maximum decline in annual inflows into Jordan due to the independent impact of land-use change alone is two times as great as the maximum decline in flow due to the independent impact of climate change. Comparing the continuing conflict versus the recovery to pre-conflict land-use scenarios under the constant climate scenario, we found that the maximum decline in inflow to Jordan from Syria is 53 and 45 MCM/year, respectively, whereas the impact of climate change alone, while keeping the land use constant, on maximum decline in inflow is only 28 and 19 MCM/year for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (table S3, A and B).</p>
