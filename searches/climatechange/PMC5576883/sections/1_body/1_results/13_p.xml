<p class="p">In addition to the increase in probability of occurrence of individual drought types in the future, there is a higher incidence rate of multiple drought types occurring contemporaneously. Evaluation of extreme events like droughts by considering a univariate (single drought type) indicator could lead to significant underestimation of the actual hazard posed by concurrent multiple drought-type events. Simultaneous coexistence of multiple forms of drought leads to compound extreme events having a significant impact (

 </xref>). We find that the probability of concurrent occurrence of all three drought types is expected to significantly increase from only 2 collective events during the baseline period to 27 and 47 collective events under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, during the 30-year period (2071â€“2100) (
