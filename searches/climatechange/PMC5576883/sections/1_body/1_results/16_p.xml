<p class="p">We analyzed the annual inflows to the Al-Wehda reservoir under four plausible scenarios, which are combinations of climate change and agricultural land-use change in Syria (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Fig. 8A</xref>). Our analysis was limited to the first half of the 21st century (2015â€“2050) because the future of the region is quite uncertain. Two of the four plausible scenarios revealed important results discussed presently. First, under the continuing conflict scenario, we assume that the current reduction in irrigated agricultural land area generated by the Syrian conflict remains unchanged until 2050 and is sufficiently represented using the 2014 post-conflict agricultural land-use map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Fig. 8D</xref>). Second, under the recovery to pre-conflict status land-use scenario, Syrian irrigated agriculture is assumed to recover to the pre-conflict state in 2025 and is sufficiently represented using the 2009 land-use map (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Fig. 8E</xref>). The irrigated land area under the recovery to pre-conflict scenario is 50% more than the irrigated land area under the continuing conflict scenario (
