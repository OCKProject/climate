<p class="p">We find that the increase in occurrence of −1 and −2 SD droughts coincides with a substantial increase in the number of years with positive temperature anomalies from 13% during the baseline period to 100% during 2071–2100 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). A positive temperature anomaly is defined as an annual average temperature departure from the baseline average that is greater than 1 SD. The probability of years having simultaneous drought (precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow) and a positive temperature anomaly increases from less than 10% to more than 90% toward the end of the 21st century when compared to the baseline period (
