<p class="p">However, considering meteorological droughts alone underestimates the impacts on streamflow and agriculture. For example, by 2071â€“2100, compared to the baseline period, the northern basins, which contain the major river tributaries, cities, and agricultural areas, we note that (i) the frequency of occurrence of hydrologic and agricultural droughts doubles, whereas meteorological drought increased by 60%, and (ii) agricultural drought duration increases from 2 to 5 months/year, whereas meteorological drought increases from 2 to 4 months/year. In addition, northern basin agriculture takes a longer time to recover from drought than the rest of Jordan. Agricultural drought duration increases by 3 months in the north versus 1.5 to 2 months in the central and southern regions, respectively.</p>
