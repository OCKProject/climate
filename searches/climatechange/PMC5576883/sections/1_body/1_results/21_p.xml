<p class="p">To determine the independent impacts of conflict-driven land-use changes and climate change on flow generation as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Fig. 8A</xref>, we separately analyzed the (i) difference in inflows to Jordan when comparing the recovery to pre-conflict status and continuing conflict scenarios under the same climate change scenario (either RCP4.5 or RCP8.5) and (ii) difference in inflows when comparing climate change scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 holding land-use change constant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8" class="xref">Fig. 8</xref>, B and C). The analysis indicated that the ongoing Syrian uprising and the resulting change in agricultural land use have over twice the impact on average annual streamflow generation than climate change (table S3, A and B) and is supported by the following results:
