<p class="p">Overall, the number of drought events (in any form) and the average drought duration (months) are significantly greater for RCP8.5 than for RCP4.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). Under RCP4.5, the future maximum drought severity is lower than the baseline period maximum drought severity during 2011–2070. However, the frequency of drought occurrence is greater than that of the baseline period. This is an indication of the emergence of a higher rate of occurrence of “moderate” drought events (−1.5 &lt; SD &lt; −1) in the near future under RCP4.5.
