<p class="p">2) The recovery to pre-conflict status land-use scenario is the best case for Syria but is the worst case in terms of transboundary river supply for Jordan. Under pre-conflict irrigated agriculture in Syria and more severe climate change impacts represented by RCP8.5, our hydrologic simulations show that after 2025, Jordan would experience little flow in the Yarmouk River. This is due to resumption of greater irrigated agriculture in upstream Syria, lower future precipitation, and higher temperatures leading to more severe and frequently occurring droughts. It is significant to note that under this scenario, average annual inflow into the Al-Wehda reservoir would be 32 MCM/year, which represents a 75% reduction in inflow compared to the baseline historical period (127 MCM/year).</p>
