<p class="p">In addition to the expected increase in the future number of dry events, the number of wet events (when precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow is more than +1 SD from the baseline) is also expected to decline during the 21st century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). This is evident under RCP8.5, wherein there is a clear decline over time in all the wet event properties (duration, frequency of occurrence, and maximum severity of wet events), thus indicating a dual impact of climate change in simultaneously reducing the wet events and increasing the dry events. The sporadic wet events are likely to occur toward the end of the 21st century and strictly fall in the moderate category (&lt;1.5 SD), with the climate models predicting a likelihood of zero monthly occurrences of receiving “severe” or extreme rainfall (&gt;1.5 or 2 SD) based on the baseline period in the second half of the 21st century (fig. S1).
