<p class="p">The other two scenarios, RCP8.5 continuing conflict and RCP4.5 recovery to pre-conflict status, are intermediate ones that fall between the best-case and worst-case scenarios discussed above. The annual average transboundary flows into Jordan are estimated to be 47 and 43 MCM/year under RCP8.5 continuing conflict and RCP4.5 recovery to pre-conflict status scenarios, respectively, during 2016â€“2050. These values are about one-third of the baseline period average annual transboundary flow during the baseline period (127 MCM/year).</p>
