<p class="p">The likelihood of increased incidence of droughts and an increasingly warmer, drier future has important implications for Jordan’s freshwater resources. The agricultural sector is the country’s largest water user (about 64% of total supply), and because of the rapidly depleting groundwater resources in the region, the nation’s irrigation demand largely relies on surface water and treated wastewater (

 </xref>). With decreased natural runoff as a consequence of increased warming and irrigation demand, we find a significant anticipated reduction in the flows into the major reservoirs within the country (fig. S3) under the RCP8.5 scenario. King Talal dam and Al-Wehda dam, which constitute the two major reservoirs in the country with a combined capacity of 188 MCM, are likely to experience a reduction in annual inflow of 31 and 65%, respectively, by the end of the 21st century. The rest of the reservoirs with a combined capacity of 45 MCM are also likely to experience a decline in annual inflows.
