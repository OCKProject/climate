<p class="p">We analyze future winter season (October to May) drought as a function of low precipitation, soil moisture deficit, and reduced streamflow based on comparison of results from the three climate models meeting the criteria that each model must satisfactorily replicate the baseline period precipitation and temperature. Under the influence of climate change during the “business-as-usual” RCP8.5 scenario that assumes a future with no policy action and increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, Jordan is expected to experience a 30% decline in annual winter precipitation and a 4.5°C increase in annual average temperature by 2071–2100 (

The effect of changes in precipitation and temperature will be further manifested in the form of changes in variables such as soil moisture and streamflow. Under RCP8.5, Jordan is likely to experience a 28 and 58% decline in soil moisture and streamflow, respectively, resulting in agricultural and hydrologic droughts (
