<p class="p">An examination of the probability density functions (PDFs), reflecting levels of drought severity for meteorological, agricultural, and hydrologic droughts, depicts a shift over time toward drier conditions under RCP8.5 (2071–2100) when compared to the baseline period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7" class="xref">Fig. 7</xref>, A to C). This shift signifies an increase in drought occurrence and severity in the future. The right (wet) tail of the PDFs for RCP8.5 is flattened, indicating low probability of occurrence of wet events for precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow. The PDFs for RCP4.5 (2071–2100) also show a temporal shift toward drier conditions, although to a lesser extent.
