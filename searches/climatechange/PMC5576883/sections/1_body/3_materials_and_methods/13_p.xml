<p class="p">3) RCP4.5 and “pre-conflict state—recovery of irrigated agriculture”: This scenario assumes moderate emissions and a recovery to pre-conflict agricultural land use in upstream Syria after 2025. Hence, from present to 2025, the agricultural land-use area is reduced because of the effect of conflict (indicated by the 2014 land-use map). After 2025, Syria is assumed to recover from the conflict and return back to the increased agricultural land area corresponding to the pre-conflict years (indicated by the 2009 land-use map). The behavior of the upstream Syrian reservoirs is assumed to be represented by average monthly releases during the post-conflict period 2012–2015 until 2025 and during 2025–2050, and the upstream Syrian reservoir releases are assumed to be represented by average monthly releases during the pre-conflict period 2000–2011.</p>
