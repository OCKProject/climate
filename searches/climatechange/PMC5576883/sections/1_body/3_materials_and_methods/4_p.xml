<p class="p">The preparation of land-use map from Landsat imagery for Syria was based on an unsupervised classification protocol, wherein the pixels were gathered in a defined number of clusters depending on the reflectance for each wavelength. The clusters were then manually associated to land-use classes, and a “temperature” analysis was carried out to differentiate between irrigated and rainfed areas. Goward 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (

  <italic class="italic">44</italic>
 </xref>) had shown that the surface temperature (Ts) declines with the increase in soil moisture and is negatively correlated with normalized difference vegetation index. Hence, Ts would be an encouraging indicator of irrigation (

  <italic class="italic">46</italic>
 </xref>). The differentiation between irrigated and rainfed areas was done on the basis of the temperature difference between cropped soil and surrounding bare soil, with a negative temperature anomaly being an indicator for irrigation. The irrigated land-use classes primarily include fruit trees (citrus, apple, and grapes), summer and winter vegetables (lettuce, eggplant, cauliflower, and tomato), and olives (partly rainfed and partly irrigated, and differentiated on the basis of temperature analysis). The source of irrigation can be either surface water or groundwater. The irrigated crop areas falling within a 5-km buffer zone from reservoirs or streams are assumed to be irrigated using surface water, and the remaining through groundwater. Irrigated water use was estimated using CROPWAT (
