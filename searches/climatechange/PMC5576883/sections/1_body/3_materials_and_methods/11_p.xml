<p class="p">1) RCP4.5 and “continuing conflict state—reduced irrigated agriculture”: This scenario assumes moderate emissions and reduced irrigated agriculture in upstream Syrian parts of the Yarmouk basin due to the impact of the continuation of the Syrian conflict, leading to migration of Syrian farmers and decline in agricultural land-use acreage. The land-use maps developed for different years based on Landsat 8 images indicated a peak in irrigated agricultural area before the beginning of the Syrian uprising in 2011. At present, under the influence of the Syrian conflict, the irrigated agricultural land area is reduced by 33% compared to the pre-conflict years (table S2). This scenario assumes that the agricultural land-use area remains at this reduced state (as indicated by the 2014 land-use map) until 2050. The behavior of the upstream Syrian reservoir releases is assumed to be represented by average monthly releases during the post-conflict period 2012–2015.</p>
