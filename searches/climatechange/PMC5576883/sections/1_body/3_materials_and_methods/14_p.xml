<p class="p">4) RCP8.5 and “pre-conflict state—recovery of irrigated agriculture”: This scenario assumes extreme emissions and a recovery to pre-conflict agricultural land use in upstream Syria after 2025. The agricultural land-use area is assumed to stay at a reduced level due to the impact of conflict until 2025 (indicated by the 2014 land-use map) and after 2025 and is assumed to improve and return back to the pre-conflict level that is 50% more (indicated by the 2009 land-use map). The behavior of the upstream Syrian reservoirs is assumed to be represented by average monthly releases during the post-conflict period 2012–2015 until 2025 and during 2025–2050, and the upstream Syrian reservoir releases are assumed to be represented by average monthly releases during the pre-conflict period 2000–2011.</p>
