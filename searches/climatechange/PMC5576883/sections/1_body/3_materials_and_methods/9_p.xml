 </xref>) and SWAT model simulations of soil moisture and streamflow at the smaller, sub-basin, hydrologic response unit scale were computed for each basin and used for analysis of meteorological, agricultural, and drought properties. On the basis of the observations or model simulations, we calculate (i) the baseline average value over 1981–2010, (ii) the deviation of the variable of interest value from the baseline average (fig. S2), (iii) classification of drought events based on the extent of deviation expressed relative to the SD in the baseline period, and (iv) drought properties consisting of duration, frequency of occurrence, and maximum severity. For the 21st century simulations, we compare all three drought properties for each 30-year period to the baseline period to facilitate evaluation of the progression of regional climate change for each drought type.
