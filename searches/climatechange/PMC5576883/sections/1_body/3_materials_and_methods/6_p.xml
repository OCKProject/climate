<p class="p">Figure S8 and table S7 show the results of calibration and validation for locations within each of the major basins in Jordan. SWAT model calibration parameters include curve number, evaporation compensation factor, baseflow recession factor, groundwater “revap” coefficient, threshold depth of water in shallow aquifer for initiation of return flow, and deep percolation. Both manual calibration and optimization algorithms in SWAT–CUP (Calibration and Uncertainty Program) were used. Details regarding the above calibration parameters, their physical implications, and routines can be found in the SWAT user manual (
