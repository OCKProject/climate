<p class="p">Although the climate models are capable of providing information, with some confidence, on how the climate is likely to evolve in future, because of their coarse spatial and temporal scale of operation, they are incapable of capturing the effects of natural processes such as flow in streams, evaporation from land and water surfaces, evapotranspiration from crops and vegetation, groundwater movement and recharge, and artificial processes such as irrigation or reservoir storage. All of these processes affect the regional hydrology and hence require a coupling of climate models with a physically based regional hydrologic model to perform climate change impact assessment on regional hydrology and natural disasters such as agricultural or hydrologic droughts.</p>
