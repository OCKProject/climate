<p class="p">A land surface rainfall-runoff model was used to obtain monthly simulations of soil moisture and streamflow for agricultural and hydrologic drought analysis [in this case, Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)]. SWAT is a distributed parameter hydrologic model that estimates the water balance within a watershed by using daily meteorological variables, topography, land use, vegetation, and soil characteristics as inputs (

 </xref>). SWAT uses Manningâ€™s equation to compute open-channel flow. Streamflow through the channel network is routed using a variation of the kinematic wave model (Muskingum method). Flows into the major reservoirs were simulated in the model, and values were checked against observed inflows. The reservoir outflows were based on rules developed on the basis of inflow and reservoir storage change data. Details regarding SWAT data requirements and model description are given in table S5 (A and B).
