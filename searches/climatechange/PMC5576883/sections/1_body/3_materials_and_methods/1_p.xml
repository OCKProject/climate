<p class="p">Analysis of meteorological, agricultural, and hydrologic droughts requires measured or estimated monthly precipitation, soil moisture, and streamflow, respectively. Streamflow considered for measuring hydrologic drought is the flow out of the basin, which, in most cases, would be a reservoir inflow. These flow values were the basis for evaluation of hydrologic drought. For the baseline period (1980–2010), daily gridded precipitation from the global meteorological forcing data set at a resolution of 0.25° was temporally aggregated to obtain monthly precipitation data and was subsequently used for the meteorological drought analysis (

The data set was chosen after performance analysis by comparing against observed rainfall at 10 station locations within Jordan. Visual inspection through comparison of monthly time series plots, autocorrelograms, empirical cumulative distribution function (CDF) plots, and other statistical metrics (root mean square error, Pearson

The results of the analysis are provided in figs. S4 to S7 and table S4 (A to C). Results indicate that by all measures, the Princeton reanalysis data set was able to reliably represent precipitation within an error margin of 10 mm/month and a high Pearson

However, the reanalysis data set is undoubtedly prone to errors related to spatial interpolation and complex (steep) topography of the region, such as locations 2 and 10. The baseline period gridded precipitation data served as the benchmark for the correction of bias in the 21st century precipitation projections obtained from regional climate model simulations.
