<p class="p">Regarding the future, two climate change scenarios considered encompass a plausible future range of conditions: (i) RCP4.5 is considered to be the “optimistic” scenario, which assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize by mid-century due to policy intervention, and (ii) RCP8.5 is considered to be the “business-as-usual” scenario, which assumes that greenhouse gas concentrations follow an increasing trajectory until the end of the 21st century. Meteorological properties, including temperature and precipitation, for the 21st century projections were based on dynamically downscaled regional climate model simulations at a resolution of 50 km from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) project (

 </xref>). CORDEX is an integrated data portal for providing downscaled global and regional climate model simulations derived from CMIP5. We restricted the analysis of the future by considering an “intelligent” subset of the CMIP5 climate models that performed well in successfully replicating the climatology during the baseline historical period (tables S1 and S8) rather than taking an ensemble average of all the CMIP5 models, many of which did not reproduce historical precipitation observations. The replication criterion was assessed in terms of the Pearson’s 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>, absolute error, percent bias, and an ENSO score (table S8). The selection criteria ensure that the chosen models satisfactorily represent the regional climatic characteristics, including ENSO that can affect Jordan’s climatology. Three climate models were chosen on the basis of these selection criteria: HadGEM, IPSL, and ECHAM. Temperature was reproduced well by all models (fig. S9B). However, precipitation was not. Those precipitation models selected were bias-corrected using a distribution mapping approach based on the observed precipitation for the baseline period (1981–2010) (see figs. S9A to S10, A to G, and table S9). Comparison of observed precipitation to the bias-corrected precipitation for a verification period (2011–2015) suggests that the bias-corrected precipitation for this period from selected models follows RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (
