<p class="p">Given the strong seasonality in the region’s climatology that manifests as zero or near-zero precipitation during the summer months, we consider only the rainy season (October to May) when analyzing drought properties. Summers are so dry and devoid of rainfall that we do not consider droughts during June to September. In the case of hydrologic droughts, the source of flow, if any, is groundwater baseflow and timed releases of treated wastewater or reservoir storage accumulated during winter. Because of many years of excessive pumping and consequent depletion of groundwater resources, the baseflow contribution to summer flows is negligible (

 </xref>). Similarly, the soil moisture levels during summer months will be largely controlled by artificial supply through irrigation, which again depends on the winter storage. Hence, the drought metrics do not consider summer months for analysis. During this rainy season, any month is considered to be under drought if monthly precipitation, soil moisture, or streamflow falls below at least 1 SD from the baseline period average. We consider the event to be a moderate drought if the variable of interest exceeds −1 SD of the baseline period, a severe drought if it exceeds −1.5 SD, and an “extreme” drought if it exceeds −2 SD (table S10).
