   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Land-use map for year 2009 indicating the increase in irrigated agricultural land use under recovery to pre-conflict scenario. The green shaded region indicates the irrigated agricultural land area. The annual incremental flows were calculated by taking the difference between the continuing conflict and recovery to pre-conflict scenarios and RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, to identify independent impacts of conflict and climate change.
