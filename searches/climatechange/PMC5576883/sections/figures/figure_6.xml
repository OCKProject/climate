  <p class="p">When the variable of interest falls above +1 SD from the baseline average, it is considered as a wet event. Wet events are defined by the number of events, average duration, and maximum severity for each 30-year time slice. The gray shaded area represents the baseline period. The severity of each wet event is defined as the sum of monthly deviations of the variable of interest exceeding +1 SD from the baseline period over a continuous period of one or more months (see figs. S1 and S2 for details). Duration of a wet event is defined as the number of months of a continuous period over which the monthly deviation of the variable of interest is above +1 SD.</p>
