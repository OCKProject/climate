<p class="p">For the 11 Nunavut weather stations with continuous or close to continuous data from 1946 to 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), we extracted monthly mean temperatures directly from Environment Canada's national climate data archive (Environment Canada, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) or calculated monthly mean temperatures from Environment Canada's daily temperature archive data. In some instances, the monthly temperatures were missing from the Environment Canada data and, in these cases, we hindcast or reconstructed the monthly mean temperature using data from the closest weather station (Leathers, Malin, Kluver, Henderson, &amp; Bogart,

 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The latitude, longitude, and elevation of the weather stations have not changed over the 70‐year period. Each collection data point was associated with the nearest, most climatically logical weather station based on synoptic and sea ice regimes (Canadian Ice Service,
