<p class="p">The process we used to choose the 23 species for this study was as follows. First, species with at least 50 herbarium specimens in flower were selected to ensure a large enough sample size. Second, species whose taxonomy was in doubt were eliminated from the analysis. Wind pollinated species were also eliminated because anthesis or receptive stigma are rarely captured or easy to identify on a herbarium specimen. Third, using our phenology monitoring data from Lake Hazen and Iqaluit, species with long flowering durations (&gt;3 weeks), e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Cassiope tetragona</italic> (L.) D. Don which flowers for 3–4 weeks (Panchen, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Panchen &amp; Gorelick, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), were eliminated because there would be large variance in flowering DOY. Species where it was difficult to determine whether the plant was in flower, e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Oxyria digyna</italic> (L.) Hill, were also eliminated from the analysis.
