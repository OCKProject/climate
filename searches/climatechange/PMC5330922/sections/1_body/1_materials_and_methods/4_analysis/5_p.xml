<p class="p">To test whether there was a bias in collection dates toward earlier herbarium specimen collection in more recent years, we correlated the date of all herbarium specimens collected for all 23 species against the year of collection (1896–2015) and for each species individually for the years 1946–2015. We used these year ranges combined with across species (1896–2015) and individual species (1946–2015) to match the analyses of change in flowering/seed dispersal time over time (1896–2015) and change in flowering with temperature per species (1946–2015). We used all herbarium specimens in the correlations, including those that were not in flower or dispersing fruit, to reflect when collections were made over the years. We ran these correlations using the National Herbarium of Canada (CAN) data because this collection has the most extensive and comprehensive collection of Nunavut herbarium specimens and the collection is completely databased (Table S1).</p>
