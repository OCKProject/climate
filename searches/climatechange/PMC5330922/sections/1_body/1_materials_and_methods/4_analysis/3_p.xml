<p class="p">To determine sensitivity of Arctic plant flowering times to temperature, we ran linear regressions for each species from across Nunavut separately with flowering DOY as the response variable and June mean temperature as the explanatory variable. We repeated the regression analyses separately for each region, island, and locale in order to compare the flowering time temperature sensitivity of plants on the Nunavut mainland versus conspecific plants on Nunavut archipelago and similarly Baffin Island plants versus Ellesmere Island conspecifics, and Lake Hazen plants versus Iqaluit conspecifics. There were insufficient data to determine sensitivity of Arctic plant seed dispersal times to temperature per species; hence, we used a standard least squares mixed model to determine seed dispersal time temperature sensitivity across Nunavut to July mean temperature across the 20 species with dispersing seed DOY as the response variable, July mean temperature as the fixed effect, and species as a random effect, and repeated for Nunavut archipelago, Baffin Island, and Ellesmere Island where there were sufficient data.</p>
