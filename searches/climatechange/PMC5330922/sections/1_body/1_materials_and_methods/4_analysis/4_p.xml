<p class="p">To determine whether there has been a trend toward earlier flowering times over the past 120 years (1896–2015) across Nunavut, we ran a standard least squares random intercept mixed model with flowering DOY as the response variable, species as a random effect, and year as a fixed effect. We ran a similar model to determine whether there has been a trend toward earlier seed dispersal times over the past 120 years (1896–2015), with dispersing seed DOY as the response variable.</p>
