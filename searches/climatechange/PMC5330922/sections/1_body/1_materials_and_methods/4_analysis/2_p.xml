<p class="p">To determine which monthly temperatures are most strongly correlated with the time of flowering of Arctic plants across Nunavut, we ran a standard least squares mixed model with flowering DOY as the response variable, species as a random effect and May, June, July, and August mean temperatures as fixed effects. We repeated this model run separately for each region, each island (Baffin and Ellesmere Islands only), and each locale (Lake Hazen and Iqaluit only), using Nunavut mainland, Nunavut archipelago, Baffin Island, Ellesmere Island, Lake Hazen, or Iqaluit flowering collection data points. We ran a similar set of models to determine which monthly temperatures are most strongly correlated with the time of seed dispersal with dispersing seed DOY as the response variable. Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island were chosen from the island classification because they were the only islands with regular collections since 1920 for Baffin Island and since 1957 for Ellesmere Island (FigureÂ
