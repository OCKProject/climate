<p class="p">Flowering times were most correlated with June mean temperatures as might be expected given that the majority of species flower in late June and July and the month(s) preceding flowering typically have the strongest correlation with flowering time (Fitter et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Panchen &amp; Gorelick, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Panchen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). July and August mean temperatures were also correlated with flowering time, albeit less significantly than June mean temperatures, and this is also to be expected given that flowering continues until the end of August (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32702-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Photoperiod and snow melt‐out date are other factors that can be correlated with the time of flowering (Bernier &amp; Périlleux, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Inouye et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Rathcke &amp; Lacey, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>). The Nunavut archipelago receives 24 hr of daylight per day starting at least 1 month before the earliest flowers are observed, while much of the Nunavut mainland experiences darkness during the growing season. Although the flowering time of some Arctic and alpine species is facultatively photoperiodic (Heide, Pedersen, &amp; Dahl, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>; Hülber et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Keller &amp; Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), it, therefore, seems unlikely that photoperiod plays a major role in the time of flowering on Baffin, Ellesmere, and other Nunavut archipelago Islands but could play a role on the Nunavut mainland. There is evidence that the snow melt‐out date is correlated with time of flowering of Arctic plants (Bjorkman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Iler, Høye, Inouye, &amp; Schmidt, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013b</xref>; Molau, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>; Stenström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). However, there are exceptions, particularly in polar deserts where there is minimal snow accumulation over winter (Bienau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Ellebjerg et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Molau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Panchen &amp; Gorelick, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Thórhallsdóttir, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Much of the Nunavut archipelago is polar desert and receives very little snow accumulation, while the Nunavut mainland receives considerably more snow (Przybylak, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). In addition, snow melt‐out date does not appear to differ much between Baffin and Ellesmere Islands (Panchen &amp; Gorelick, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, photoperiod and/or snow melt‐out date could account for some of the intraspecific differences in flowering time sensitivity to temperature between the Nunavut mainland and Nunavut archipelago but less likely between Baffin and Ellesmere Islands.
