<p class="p">Temperature changes observed since 1946 reflect the three synoptic weather systems that dominate Nunavut. Baker Lake, Cambridge Bay, and Coral Harbour are predominantly influenced by continental systems (Fletcher &amp; Young,

 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) and are experiencing the greatest rises in temperature, both annually and in the months of June and July, and these temperatures have been rising continually since 1946. Alert, Eureka, Isachsen, and Resolute are predominantly influenced by Arctic Ocean basin systems (Edlund &amp; Alt, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>; Fletcher &amp; Young,

 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>) and experienced a regime shift from a cooling period to a warming period (Reid et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Throop et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Clyde, Iqaluit, and Hall Beach are influenced by Atlantic Ocean systems and have experienced little or no warming annually or in the months of June and July and no regime shift. Pond Inlet can experience any of the three systems in different years or months and perhaps might explain the regime shift from a steady temperature to a warming period. It is possible that the regime shifts could be an artifact of change in temperature measuring equipment, from manual readings in the early days to automated measurement in more recent years. However, if this were the case, we would have expected to see the regime shift in approximately the same year for all months and annually at a weather station and possibly across the weather stations given that Environment Canada would upgrade all of its weather stations at approximately the same time but the regime shift year varied widely across months and stations (Table S4).
