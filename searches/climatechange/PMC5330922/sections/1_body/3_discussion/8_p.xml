<p class="p">In conclusion, flowering times of Nunavut plants are most strongly correlated with June mean temperature and seed dispersal times are most strongly correlated with July mean temperature. On average over the past 120Â years, seed dispersal times have advance twice as fast as flowering times in Nunavut and likely reflect greater increases in July than June mean temperatures. The diversity in flowering time temperature sensitivity among species could result in altered community ecology and those changes could vary in different parts of Nunavut given the variation in temperature trends and intraspecific phenological temperature sensitivity across the territory.</p>
