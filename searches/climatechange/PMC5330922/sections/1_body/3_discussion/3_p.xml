<p class="p">Given that (1) flowering times and fruiting times are most correlated with June and July temperatures, respectively and (2) compared to June temperatures, July temperatures are warming more and warming across a wider area of Nunavut, it is not surprising that seed dispersal times have advanced over twice as fast as flowering times over the past 120 years in Nunavut. This implies that the duration for seeds to mature is becoming shorter and there is potential for greater sexual reproductive success and an extended reproductive season in the short Arctic growing season (Alatalo &amp; Totland,
