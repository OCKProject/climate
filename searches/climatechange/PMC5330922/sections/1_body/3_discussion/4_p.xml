<p class="p">As expected, the smaller the spatial scale, the better the model fit. However, even at the largest spatial scale, i.e., across the 2.1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of Nunavut, there was a significant relationship between flowering time or seed dispersal time versus monthly mean temperatures. This is surprising given the large geographical area, the large distances between temperature data sources and different year‐to‐year variations in the synoptic weather systems across Nunavut (Fletcher &amp; Young,

Given the large geographical area included in the analysis, the absolute values of the phenological temperature sensitivity should be treated with caution; it is the relative values that are important here. Among the spatial scale comparisons, the flowering time temperature sensitivity of plants at Iqaluit appears to be the most pronounced, but this analysis is on a small spatial scale and hence perhaps temperature sensitivity is underestimated at the larger spatial scales due to greater variations in the flowering times. Similarly, flowering phenology of plants at Lake Hazen appears to be more temperature sensitive than conspecifics from across Ellesmere Island. The start and end year used in temperature climate change analysis, combined with a greater interannual temperature variation than the warming trend, can play a strong role in the magnitude of the warming or phenological trends observed (Baker, Hartley, Butchart, &amp; Willis,
