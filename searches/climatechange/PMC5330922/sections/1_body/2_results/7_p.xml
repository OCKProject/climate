<p class="p">Annual temperatures have risen significantly since 1946 at nine of the 11 weather stations, albeit with a very weak correlation at Hall Beach (Nunavut archipelago) and Pond Inlet (Baffin Island), while annual temperatures at Clyde (Baffin Island) and Iqaluit (Baffin Island) have not risen significantly (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32702-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). Baker Lake (Nunavut mainland) and Cambridge Bay (Victoria Island) in the south and west of Nunavut experienced the most dramatic annual temperature increases of 0.30 and 0.35°C/decade, respectively. In contrast, May and August mean temperatures have not risen significantly at any of the 11 weather stations. June mean temperatures have risen significantly since 1946 only at Baker Lake, Cambridge Bay, and Pond Inlet and, although significant, very weakly correlated at Coral Harbour (Nunavut mainland; 0.36, 0.33, 0.25, and 0.24°C/decade, respectively). Following a similar pattern to the June mean temperature, July mean temperature has risen significantly since 1946 at Baker Lake, Cambridge Bay, Coral Harbour, Eureka (Ellesmere Island), Pond Inlet, and, although significant, are very weakly correlated at Clyde (0.28, 0.30, 0.37, 0.26, 0.37, and 0.17°C/decade, respectively). The most dramatic June mean temperature increases are at Baker Lake and Cambridge Bay with 0.36 and 0.33°C/decade rise, respectively, while the most dramatic July mean temperature increases are at Coral Harbour and Pond Inlet, both rising 0.37°C/decade.
