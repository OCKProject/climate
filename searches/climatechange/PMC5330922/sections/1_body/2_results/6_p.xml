<p class="p">The correlation of collection date for all herbarium specimens versus year (1896–2015) was very weak (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .05 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 3,025, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .0001). There was no significant correlation per species between collection date for all herbarium specimens and year (1946–2015) for most species (Table S3). This suggests there was little to no change in collection time frame over the years and unlikely to have caused a bias in our analysis.
