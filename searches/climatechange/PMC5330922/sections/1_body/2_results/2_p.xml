<p class="p">There is considerable variation in the range of flowering DOY of each species over the 120 years (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32702-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The species with the least variation was 
 <italic class="italic">Erysimum pallasii</italic> (Pursh) Fernald, with a range of 43 days. The species with the greatest variation in flowering DOY was the snow bed species 
 <italic class="italic">Ranunculus nivalis</italic> L., with a range of 88 days. The order of flowering (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) is consistent with recent observations (Panchen &amp; Gorelick, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), indicating that the collection flowering time data are representative of species’ relative time of flowering through the growing season.
