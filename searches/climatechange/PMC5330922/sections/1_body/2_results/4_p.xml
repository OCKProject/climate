<p class="p">All but two of the 23 species showed a significant negative relationship between time of flowering and June mean temperature, that is, these species flower earlier with warmer June mean temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Table S2). The magnitude of a species’ flowering time sensitivity to June mean temperature varied across Nunavut. The flowering phenology of plants in the Nunavut archipelago was generally more sensitive to June mean temperatures than conspecific plants on the Nunavut mainland, and plants on Baffin Island were generally more sensitive than conspecifics on Ellesmere Island. Flowering times at Iqaluit were generally the most sensitive to June mean temperature. Flowering time temperature sensitivity varied dramatically ranging from −1.7 days/°C (
 <italic class="italic">S. cernua</italic> L. on Nunavut mainland) to −9.6 days/°C (
 <italic class="italic">D. lapponica</italic> at Iqaluit). The annual/biennial 
 <italic class="italic">Androsace septentrionalis</italic> and the late‐flowering 
 <italic class="italic">Chamerion latifolium</italic> (L.) Holub were the only species whose flowering time showed no sensitivity to temperature. The seed dispersal time sensitivity to July mean temperature of the 20 species from across Nunavut was −1.79 days/°C (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 346, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .0001). That is, seed dispersal was 1.79 days earlier for every 1°C rise in July mean temperature. The seed dispersal time sensitivity to July mean temperature across species was −2.3, −3.65, and −1.64 days/°C in Nunavut archipelago, Baffin Island, and Ellesmere Island, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 288, 123, 87, respectively, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .0001).
