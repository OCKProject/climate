<p class="p">Since 1946, a regime shift has been experienced at Alert, Eureka, Isachsen, and Resolute (Nunavut archipelago) weather stations, with a cooling or steady temperature period followed by a warming period with change points in the 1970s to 1980s for annual mean temperatures, the late 1960s and early 1970s for June mean temperatures, and 1990s to 2000s for July mean temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32702-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, Table S4). Baker Lake and Coral Harbour (Nunavut mainland) and Cambridge Bay (Victoria Island) weather stations experienced an annual mean temperature regime shift from steady temperatures to warming temperatures in 1987, 1964, and 1989, respectively, but no significant regime shift for June or July mean monthly temperatures. Clyde, Hall Beach, Iqaluit, and Pond Inlet weather stations experienced an annual mean temperature regime shift from cooling or steady temperatures to warming temperatures, but only Pond Inlet has seen a June and July mean temperature regime shift from cooling to warming temperatures in 1985 and 1977, respectively. Large interannual variation in monthly and annual temperatures of several degrees Celsius was observed for all weather stations (Figure
