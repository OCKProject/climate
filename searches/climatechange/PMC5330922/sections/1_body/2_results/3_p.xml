<p class="p">June mean temperature had the strongest correlation with the timing of flowering at all spatial scales, except Ellesmere Island where July mean temperature had the strongest correlation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32702-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). May to August mean temperatures also had a significant correlation with the timing of flowering at some spatial scales. July mean temperature had the strongest correlation with the timing of seed dispersal at all spatial scales, except Nunavut mainland where, although not significant, August had the strongest correlation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32702-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). As expected, in general the models had better fit at finer‐grained spatial scales.
