<p class="p">In temperate regions, herbarium specimens have often been collected regularly on a local scale enabling the construction of a flowering phenology time series at a single location over extended periods of time, and hence, most temperate phenology–climate change studies have focused on a localised area with homogeneous topography and climatology. In situations where there are spatial or temporal gaps in the phenology record from herbarium specimens, the phenological historical records have been successfully augmented with dated photographs and field observations (Bertin,

 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Conducting a similar study in the Arctic, however, poses a challenge (Holopainen, Helama, Lappalainen, &amp; Gregow, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations have only been collected sporadically and, on many occasions, only once from a particular location across the whole of the topographically and climatologically varied Nunavut territory, Canada, necessitating a study on large spatial scales. The largest area, to date, used in herbarium specimen climate change phenology analysis is in Ohio, where a 116,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area with 26 weather stations was assessed (Calinger, Queenborough, &amp; Curtis, 
 <xref rid="ece32702-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Nunavut has an area of 2.1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and just 11 weather stations with long‐term temperature records. In addition, almost all of the weather stations in Nunavut are coastal and hence influenced by the effect of the sea ice and its melting regime and therefore may not be reflective of temperatures in the interior (Atkinson &amp; Gajewski,
