<p class="p">The primary objectives of this research were to use herbarium specimens, photographs, and field observations collected from across Nunavut to determine (1) which monthly temperatures most strongly influence the timing of flowering and timing of seed dispersal of Arctic plants; (2) the sensitivity of Arctic plant flowering times and seed dispersal times to temperature as an indicator of the impact of climate change on Arctic plant phenology; and (3) whether there has been a change in flowering times and seed dispersal times over the last 120 years in Nunavut. A complementary objective was to assess contemporary climate change with regard to changes in monthly temperatures in Nunavut. More broadly, this research will serve as a proof of concept to assess whether phenology–climate change studies using historic data can be conducted at large spatial scales.</p>
