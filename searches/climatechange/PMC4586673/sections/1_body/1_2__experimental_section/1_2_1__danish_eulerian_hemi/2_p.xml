<p class="p">The mercury chemistry scheme applied in the mercury sub-model of DEHM is based on the Tropospheric Chemistry Module (TCM) [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], which consists of three gas phase compounds: Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup>, HgO, HgCl
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; 1 particulate phase Hg and nine aqueous phase compounds. Ozone is the most important oxidant for the formation of reactive gaseous mercury (RGM) and total particulate mercury (TPM) in this scheme. An additional fast oxidation rate of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> to HgO is assumed during polar sunrise over sea-ice in the Arctic in order to simulate the Atmospheric Mercury Depletion Events (AMDEs), which accounts for up to about half of the deposition from the atmosphere [
