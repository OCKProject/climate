<p class="p">In all the simulations presented here, the contribution from the background concentration is known. Therefore, this post-processing procedure has been used for all the presented results. The ozone concentrations are provided by the SOx-NHx-NOx-O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>-VOC chemistry module, and Black Carbon concentrations, which are applied in the model for the production of particulate Hg in the aqueous phase chemistry, are provided by the particle module in DEHM.
