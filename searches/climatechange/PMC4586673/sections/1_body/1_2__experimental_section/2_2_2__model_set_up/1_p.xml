<p class="p">We have performed two model experiments in this study. The first model experiment was made to estimate the influence of climate change on the atmospheric transport of Hg to the Arctic and the deposition within the Arctic. This experiment was also applied to identify the major source areas of Hg to the Arctic and to study if there is a change in the importance of the different source areas in the applied climate change scenario. The second model experiment was made to estimate the effects of changes in emissions compared to the effect of changes in climate conditions. For the first experiment we made four sets of simulations, one with all sources, one with no sources in North America (NA), one with no sources in Europe (EU), and one with no sources in Asia (AS), see
