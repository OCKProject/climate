 <sup class="sup">0</sup> and RGM, the contribution from the global background is 64% of the total concentration in the 1990s, while Asia contributes with 25%, Europe with 6% and 5% arrives from North America. The difference in the contributions for the two decades is less than 1% for Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> and RGM, which means that the relative contribution from the source areas does not depend on the climate according to these model simulations. For particulate Hg, the contribution from the background is smaller (47% for the 1990s, 43% for the 2090s), mainly because of the transport of primary particulate Hg. Europe contributes with 17% in the 1990s and 20% in the 2090s, Asia with 30% and 31% for the two decades and North America with 6% for both decades. This indicates that the transport of primary particulate Hg, especially from Europe, is enhanced in the 2090s compared to the 1990s under the applied climate change scenario. Results from the DEHM model also indicates that the atmospheric transport of POPs to the Arctic is larger in a future warmer climate [
