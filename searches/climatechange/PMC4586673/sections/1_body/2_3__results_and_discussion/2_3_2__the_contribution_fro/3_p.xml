Although their division of source areas was finer than the one applied in this study and their model domain did not cover the most eastern part of the Arctic, some similarities are seen. The contribution from re-emission and natural sources (corresponding to the background in this study) accounts for an estimated two thirds of the deposition to the Canadian Arctic, while (East) Asia is the major anthropogenic source area followed by Europe and North America.
