<p class="p">The relative contribution to the deposition is also shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> and these are quite similar to the relative contributions of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> concentrations as described above, reflecting that Hg is mainly transported to the Arctic as Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> which is oxidized to RGM and particulate Hg during the transport and some of this oxidized Hg is deposited. The larger atmospheric transport of TPM in the 2090s than in the 1990s is so small compared to the Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> that it does not influence the overall relative contribution distribution. The global background is the most important contributor. There are only very small differences (&lt;0.2%) in the relative contributions for the two decades indicating that climate change do not have a large influence on the relative contribution of the source areas. All the source areas in the Northern Hemisphere contributes to a large background pool of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> and this is getting well mixed before the Hg is deposited because of the long lifetime of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> in the atmosphere (1 year). However, there are some differences between the source areas in how large a fraction of the total emission that is deposited in the Arctic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-12-11254-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Europe is relatively the most important source area from which around 4.4% of the total Hg emission is deposited in the Arctic in the 1990s, while it is 3.3% for Asia and 3.2% for North America. This shows that the emissions from Europe are more efficiently transported to the Arctic compared to emissions from Asia and North America, which are both located more southerly and in addition have a longer transport pathway before they arrive in the Arctic. Common for all three source areas is that these fractions are lower in the 2090s compared to the 1990s (3.7%, 2.7% and 2.6% for EU, AS, and NA, respectively), corresponding to 16%â€“18% lower. This is due to the lower deposition owing to the lower sea-ice fraction in the 2090s than in the 1990s.
