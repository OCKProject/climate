 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] indicate that reactions of Hg with atomic bromine can account for the conversion of Hg

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-12-11254" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. There are uncertainties regarding the origin of atmospheric Br that are associated with snow, refreezing leads and formation of first-year sea-ice [

Following the increasing atmospheric temperature the formation of first year sea ice is expected to increase, which could lead to an increase in release of Br to the atmosphere, which again will result in an increase of the rate of Hg deposition during AMDEs [
