<p class="p">The main reason for the differences between the two decades in the model is that the parameterization of the fast oxidation of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> to HgO during the AMDEs depends on the sea-ice fraction. The lower sea-ice fraction in the 2090s compared to the 1990s will result in a lower oxidation of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> to HgO and therefore a higher concentration of Hg
 <sup class="sup">0</sup> and lower concentrations of RGM and TPM.
