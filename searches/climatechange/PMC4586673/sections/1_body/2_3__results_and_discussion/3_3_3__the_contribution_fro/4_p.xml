<p class="p">According to the model simulations presented here, the decrease of the Hg deposition due to climate changes are smaller than the decrease due to emission changes in both the MFTR and zero emission scenarios; 18% 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. 20% or 37%, respectively. When combining the MFTR and zero emission scenarios with changed climate input, the model system predicts total Arctic Hg deposition that are 33% lower for the MFTR emission scenario and 47% lower for zero emission scenario for the end of 21st century compared to end of 20th century (
