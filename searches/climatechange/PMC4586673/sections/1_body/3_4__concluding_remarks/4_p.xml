<p class="p">DEHM predicts between a 6% increase (Status Quo scenario) and a 37% decrease (zero anthropogenic emissions scenario) in Hg deposition to the Arctic under present day climate depending on which of the four emissions scenarios that are applied. The relative change in Hg deposition to the Arctic between the 1990s and the 2090s is the same for all applied emissions scenarios.</p>
