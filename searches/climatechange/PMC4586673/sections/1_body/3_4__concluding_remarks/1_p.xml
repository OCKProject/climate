<p class="p">We have performed a series of model simulations to test how the Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) reacts to climate change forcing. We have investigated how the atmospheric concentrations and depositions of Hg in the Arctic changes under a moderate climate change scenario. We have furthermore studied the contribution from the major source areas (Asia, Europe and North America) and finally we have investigated how changes in emissions affect the deposition in the Arctic compared to changes in climate.</p>
