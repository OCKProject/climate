<p class="p">The model system predicts total Arctic Hg deposition that are up to 47% lower for the end of 21st century compared to end of 20th century when combining the emission change scenarios with changed climate input. The combined effect of changing both emissions and climate input is different than the sum of the simulation with changed emission and the simulation with changed climate.</p>
