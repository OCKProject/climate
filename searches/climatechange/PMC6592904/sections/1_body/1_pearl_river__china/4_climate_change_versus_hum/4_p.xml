 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> clearly shows the dramatic difference between what could have been (under natural forcing only) and the impact of human activities to date (assuming that no significant human interventions, positive or negative, will take place during the remainder of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century). The percentage reduction of fluvial sediment supply to the coast due to human impacts from 1954 to 2013 is 71%, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. The projected CC driven increase in riverflow during the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century will only compensate for 1% of this deficit by 2100.
