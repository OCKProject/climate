<p id="Par14" class="p">Subsequently, the fluvial sediment supply the coast may have received due only to natural forcing (including climate change but excluding all human impacts) was computed. When all human impacts are neglected, ideally, the system can be expected to behave as it did during the “natural” Phase 1. Furthermore, several studies have indicated that climate change driven variations in runoff during the latter half of the 20

 </sup>. Therefore, in this “natural forcing only” computation, the PR rating curve for Phase 1 was used together with the measured riverflows to compute the fluvial sediment supply to the coast for the period 1954–1999. For the entirety of the 21

 </sup>, an increase of 10% in the runoff (by 2079–2099, relative to 1979–1999) was adopted. In this 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century sediment load calculation too, the rating curve computed for the natural Phase (i.e. Phase 1) was used because all human impacts are being neglected in this calculation. The potential fluvial sediment supply to the coast under only natural forcing (including climate change) for the entire 1954–2100 period is shown in Fig.
