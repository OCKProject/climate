<p id="Par16" class="p">Although a recent analysis of multi-decadal shoreline mobility in response to changes in fluvial sediment supply shows that the subaerial Pearl delta is still advancing seaward

 </sup> that have also examined the evolution of the sub-aqueous bathymetry of the Pearl delta have shown that parts of the delta are in fact presently eroding or accreting at a decreasing rate. Therefore, like several other large deltas in the world that have not yet been significantly or visibly impacted, the decrease in fluvial sediment supply to the coast identified here is likely to change the morphological evolution of the coastal zone adjacent to the Pearl River (inclusive of the Pearl delta) in the years ahead. For example, erosion of Yangtze delta is reported to have commenced when the fluvial sediment supply to the coast decreased by 50%

 </sup>. Given that the computed decrease in fluvial sediment supply from 1954–2013 by the Pearl River is already 71%, it is therefore highly likely that the Pearl delta will also face a similar fate, sooner rather than later. Furthermore, sediment starvation by the river-adjacent coastline could lead to sustained coastline recession as has also been observed at the Yangze

 </sup>. The projected decrease in fluvial sediment loads in the Pearl River could also have significant environmental implications, due to the associated reduction in the ability of the water column to self-decontaminate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>. A potential positive impact of the projected decrease in fluvial sediment supply is increased nearshore zone primary productivity. Enhanced photosynthesis of planktons due to the potential increase in transparency of seawater associated with a reduction in suspended sediment concentration in the water column could result in such an increase in primary productivity in the nearshore zone

 </sup>. This type of environmental impacts are not only relevant for the Pearl Delta, arguably one of the key economic regions in China, but also for nearby Macau and Hong Kong, and thus requires attention in future studies.
