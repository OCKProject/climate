<p id="Par12" class="p">For the purposes of this study, it is necessary to determine the relative contributions of climate change and human activities on fluvial sediment supply to the coast in a way that is consistent for both the past and the future (given that measured sediment loads are not available for the future). To that end, sediment loads predicted by the rating curves described above were here used together with reasonable assumptions. The computational procedure followed is illustrated in
