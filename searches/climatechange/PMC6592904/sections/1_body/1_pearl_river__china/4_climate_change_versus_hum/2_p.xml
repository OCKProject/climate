<p id="Par13" class="p">First, the total fluvial sediment supply to the coast (i.e. at location PR) was computed under the combined effect of climate change and human activities. For Phases 1 to 4, the mean fluvial sediment supply at PR per Phase was computed using the monthly measured riverflow data and rating curves for PR (see Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref> in Supplementary Material). Post-2014 riverflows were estimated using the 0–10% increase over the 21

 </sup>. Here, assuming a high end scenario, an increase of 10% in the runoff (by 2079–2099, relative to 1979–1999) was used in all calculations. The fluvial sediment supply for the period 2014–2099 was then calculated with the rating curve obtained for Phase 4 at location PR, with the assumption that no more significant human interventions will take place at this already heavily engineered system. The fluvial sediment supply to the coast under the combined effect of climate change and human impacts over the period 1954–2100 thus calculated is shown in Fig.
