<p id="Par19" class="p">As in the case of the Pearl River, the dominance of human impacts over that of climate change on fluvial sediment supply to the coast is likely at other heavily engineered rivers around the world. If remedial measures are not implemented sooner rather than later, the result will be substantial sediment starvation along river-adjacent coastal zones leading to pervasive coastal erosion and ensuing land losses. This will not only threaten existing coastal zone communities and developments but will also compromise foreshadowed coastal zone developments and expansions.</p>
