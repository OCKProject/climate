<p id="Par17" class="p">The stability of river-adjacent coastal zones (inclusive of deltas) is strongly dependent on the continued supply of fluvial sediment to the coast. Any significant departure from the natural fluvial sediment supply is very likely to result in sustained erosion leading to large scale coastal zone land losses. With the strategic use of historical data and future projections, this study derived quantitative insights into the relative impacts of human activities and climate change on variations in fluvial sediment supply to the coast at the globally relevant Pearl River, China, over a ~150 year period (1954â€“2100).</p>
