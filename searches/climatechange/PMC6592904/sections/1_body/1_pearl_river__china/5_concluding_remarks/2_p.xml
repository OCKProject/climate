<p id="Par18" class="p">This analysis showed that the fluvial sediment supply to the coast from the Pearl river has decreased (from its natural state) by 71% from 1954â€“2013 due to human activities, and that projected increases in riverflow due to climate change will compensate for just 1% of this deficit by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (if the impact of human activities is maintained at current levels). Based on these projections, the coastal zone of the Pearl River will be starved of approximately 6,000 Mt of fluvial sediment during the remainder of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century.
