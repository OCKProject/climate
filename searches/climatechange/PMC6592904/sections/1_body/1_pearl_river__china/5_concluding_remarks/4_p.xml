<p id="Par20" class="p">Furthermore, the results of this study underline the importance of taking into account catchment effects, particularly those due to human activities, in coastal zone management and planning efforts which have historically looked at the coast mostly from the sea side (i.e. basing all decisions on characteristics of sediment transport driven by oceanic processes such as waves, tides, extreme sea levels, sea level rise etc.). The non-inclusion of a large human induced deficit in fluvial sediment supply to the coast, such as that projected here for the Pearl River, when considering the coastal zone sediment budget could lead to sub-optimal designs and decisions, which may, under some circumstances, place coastal settlements and communities at risk.</p>
