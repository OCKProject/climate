<p id="Par6" class="p">Monthly riverflow and sediment load data measured at 9 stations from 1954–2013 along the Pearl River (see methods and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> in Supplementary Material) were used to gain insights on the spatio-temporal evolution of the fluvial sediment transport along the river. The measurement stations (XLT, TE, DA, QJ, DHJK, WZ, GY, SJ and BL) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. To compute riverflow and sediment load at the Pearl river outlet (virtual station PR), the data at stations GY, SJ, and BL were added together.
