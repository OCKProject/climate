<p id="Par8" class="p">From the 1950s to the late 1970s, fluvial sediment loads in the Pearl river system have mainly been governed by river discharge, followed by an increased impact of deforestation till the end of the 1980s. From the early 1990s, dam construction has dominated the fluvial sediment loads in the Pearl River, with the period from the early 1990s to the mid-2000s being affected by the construction of the Yangtan dam, and the final period from the mid-2000s onward being affected by the construction of the Longtan dam. Following this philosophy, here we have divided the historical period 1954–2013 into the four phases shown in Fig.
