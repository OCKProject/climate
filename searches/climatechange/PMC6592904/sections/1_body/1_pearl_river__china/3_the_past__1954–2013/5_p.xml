<p id="Par10" class="p">To understand the physical drivers underlying the above described temporally varying fluvial sediment transport regime of the river, here we made strategic use of sediment rating curves (i.e. empirically determined relationships between sediment load and water discharge at measurement stations) developed for the 9 stations and the ocean outlet (PR) (see methods and Supplementary Material). During Phase 1 (1954–1979), the sediment load predicted by the rating curves (when used together with measured riverflows) follows the observed sediment load data at all 10 locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Therefore, Phase 1 can be considered as a water discharge controlled phase (or a largely “natural” phase) devoid of significant human influences. Having established this “baseline”, it is then possible to use the Phase 1 rating curves to compute what the sediment loads “would have been” during the other 3 Phases in the absence of any significant human influences. It should however be noted that the baseline period, during which no significant human impacts are expected to have occurred, might vary among different reaches of the complex Pearl river system. However, along the main West river reach (XLT – PR), the sediment load is completely governed by river discharge over the 1954–1979 period (as shown by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), and hence this period is suitable as the overall baseline period for the purposes of this study.
