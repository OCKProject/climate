<p id="Par9" class="p">Analysis of the fluvial sediment loads along the main river reach (XLT to PR) during the four discrete phases shows distinct differences in the characteristics of sediment supply to the coast among the different phases. Over the period 1954–1979 (Phase 1), the sediment load increases along a downstream continuum with the upper reach (XLT to QJ) contributing over half of the total fluvial sediment supply to the coast, with further contributions from tributaries downstream. During the subsequent decade or so (1980–1991; Phase 2), fluvial sediment supply to the coast increases, mostly due to an increase in the contribution from the upper reach. From 1992–2006, the reverse behavior is observed where the fluvial sediment supply to the coast decreases below that during Phase 1. In the final period from 2007–2013 (Phase 4), fluvial sediment supply to the coast decreases even further to less than 30% that of Phase 1.</p>
