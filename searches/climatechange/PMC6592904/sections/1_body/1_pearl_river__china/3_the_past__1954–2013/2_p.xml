 </sup> have indicated that, in terms of fluvial sediment loads in the Pearl river, the historical period from 1954 to 2013 can be divided into four discrete phases. It should be noted that while the exact timing of the four phases may be somewhat different among the West, North and East rivers of the Pearl river basin, Wu

 </sup> have shown that the combined fluvial sediment load in the North and East rivers (SJ and BL) is about 10% of the total sediment supply to the coast (GY, SJ and BL combined). Therefore, as the focus of this study is the fluvial sediment supply to the coast from the Pearl river basin as a whole, here we have considered the same phase timings at all stations to enable the basin aggregated calculations that are necessary for this analysis.
