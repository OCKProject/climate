<p id="Par4" class="p">Pearl river, China, is the 2
 <sup class="sup">nd</sup> largest river in China in terms of water discharge (after the Yangtze river), and being among the largest 25 rivers in the world, is a globally significant system

 </sup>. The Pearl river basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) is home to 230 million people
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
