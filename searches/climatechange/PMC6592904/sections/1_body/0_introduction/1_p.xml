 </sup>. However, due to rapidly increasing demands for water, food, land and power, a number of human-induced stressors are resulting in large scale and potentially irrevocable changes in these natural systems

 </sup>. One such change is the sustained erosion and ensuing land losses in the heavily populated deltas and adjacent coastlines (referred to hereon simply as 
 <italic class="italic">coastal zones</italic> for convenience) due to the reduction of fluvial sediment supply to coast. More often than not, upstream dam constructions is the main driver of such reductions in fluvial sediment supply to the coast

 </sup>. For example, the Three Gorges Dam in China has been retaining about 80% of sediment from upstream since it entered into operation in 2003, resulting in a massive reduction in fluvial sediment supply to the coast by the Yangtze river
