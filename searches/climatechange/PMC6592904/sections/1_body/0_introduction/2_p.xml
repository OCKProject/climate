<p id="Par3" class="p">Potential future land losses in coastal zones due to decreases in fluvial sediment supply is an increasing global concern due to the combination of (a) the significant increase in the construction of/plans for new mega dams over the last two decades

 </sup>. Nevertheless, to date there is little quantitative understanding of how the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to fluvial sediment loads may evolve over the coming decades in many of the world’s important river systems. Such quantitative knowledge is however crucial to enable effective basin scale catchment and coastal zone management

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century projections to quantify the relative contributions from both human impacts and climate change to the fluvial sediment supplied to the coast by the Pearl River, China over a ~150 year period (mid-20
