<p id="Par23" class="p">Extensive studies of this type of functions have found that the 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> coefficient is an index of erosion severity, or the source of sediment supply. A high 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> parameter is associated with intensely weathered material which can be easily eroded and transported

 </sup>. The exponent 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> represents the erosive power of the river and the influence on the sediment supply from the entire catchment surface. The value of 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> can also be affected by the grain size distribution of the material available for transport in the river basin. Large values of 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> indicate an increase in sediment transport capacity of the river

 <italic class="italic">a</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> coefficients as relevant to the Pearl river is provided by Zhang
