<p class="p">In terms of effects at the individual level (or Level 1 unit of analysis), education level and household income were not statistically associated with our outcome variables, while sex and political orientation exerted the strongest influence on both climate change belief and support for government regulation of carbon emissions. In accordance with previous findings

 <xref rid="pone.0103180-Zelezny1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">[48]</xref>, political conservatism predicted lower levels of belief in climate change (b = −.148,

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .004), men showed decreased levels of belief in climate change (b = −.426, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .001) and a lower level of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b = −.498, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>&lt;.001), and age was significantly associated with climate change belief (b = −.012, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .011), with older respondents tending to show less belief about the reality of climate change. The relative strength of the proximity effect (b = −.038 and b = −.036) was low in comparison with sex and political orientation, and it was slightly lower than the effect of regional deprivation, but our results indicate that distance to coast was significantly associated with climate change belief and support for emissions regulation.
