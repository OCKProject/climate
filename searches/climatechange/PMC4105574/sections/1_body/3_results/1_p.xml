<p class="p">Results from our multilevel random-intercept model are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0103180-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. As predicted, distance from the coast significantly predicted decreased levels of belief in climate change (b = −.038, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .004) and lower levels of support for government regulation of carbon emissions (b = −.036, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .005). These unstandardized coefficients indicate that for every additional 10 km from the coast that residents live, they are likely to be .038 units lower in their belief in climate change, and .036 units lower in their support for government regulation of carbon emissions. Considering that ratings of the two outcomes ranged from a minimum possible value of 1 to a maximum of 7 (a total of 6 units), our model therefore indicates that someone who lives 100 km from the coastline will be on average .38 units lower in their belief in climate change [.38 = 10 * .038], or roughly 6.3% of the total possible scale range lower [6.33 = (.38/6) * 100], compared to someone who lives by the coastline. In New Zealand, the maximum distance from the coastline a person could reside is approximately 177 km. The effect of proximity is relatively small, but still statistically significant even considering the small geographical area of the country.
