<p class="p">Based on the global-average time differentials of energies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) and the conversion rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the time series of generation and dissipation rates are generated (see Methods). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> displays the global-average generation and dissipation rates, which suggests that all generation/dissipation rates are increasing with time. 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref> further suggests that all positive trends have confidence levels &gt;90% except for the positive trends of

 <italic class="italic">D</italic>(
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>
 <sub class="sub">M</sub>) (confidence level∼87.2%) from ERA-Interim. The positive trends in the generation and dissipation rates are mainly due to the increasing conversion rates, because the time differentials of energies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) are at least one order of magnitude smaller than the conversion rates (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), so the time differentials of energies do not play significant roles in determining the generation and dissipation rates (see Methods).
