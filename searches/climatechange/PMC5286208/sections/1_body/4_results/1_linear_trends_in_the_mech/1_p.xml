<p class="p">The latest versions of the two reanalysis data sets (that is,, NCEP-DOE R2 and ERA-Interim) are combined with the theoretical frame to investigate the Lorenz energy cycle of the global atmosphere and its spatio-temporal variabilities. First, we average the energy cycle over the 35-year time period to update the time-mean state of the Lorenz energy cycle (
