 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref> data set because of advances made in the assimilation system. The three reanalysis data sets are the best publicly available data sets for the long-term global meteorological conditions, which include the necessary variables (for example, three-dimensional wind field, temperature field and geo-potential height field) with a daily time step to compute the Lorenz energy cycle of the global atmosphere. The three data sets are obtained by assimilating satellite data into state-of-the-art analysis/forecast models, which makes them physically consistent. In addition, the three satellite-based data sets, covering a much longer time period than the 5-year and 10-year global data sets used in the previous studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, provide a great opportunity to study the temporal characteristics of the global atmospheric energy cycle. Our following discussions are mainly based on NCEP-DOE R2 and ERA-Interim data sets in the modern satellite era (1979–2013). The NASA MERRA-2 data set, which has a different time period (1980–2013), is used to validate the results from the first two data sets NCEP-DOE R2 and ERA-Interim (
