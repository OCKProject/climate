 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. However, studies of the long-term temporal characteristics of the global atmospheric energy cycle are lacking. Here we examine the linear trends of the Lorenz energy cycle of the global atmosphere in the modern satellite era (1979–2013) with two satellite-based meteorological data sets (see Methods): the newest reanalysis from the National Centers of Environmental Prediction and the Department of Energy Reanalysis II (NCEP-DOE R2)
