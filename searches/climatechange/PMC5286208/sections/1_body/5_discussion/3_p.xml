Our estimates of the generation and dissipation rates of energies also offer important hints to the distribution and variability of the heating/cooling and friction in the global atmosphere, which cannot be measured easily. Finally, the statistical characteristics of the global atmospheric energy cycle are important for the validation of the simulations of climate change, for they constitute further constraints that must be fulfilled.
