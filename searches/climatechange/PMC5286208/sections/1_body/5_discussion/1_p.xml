<p class="p">The Lorenz energy cycle of the global atmosphere and its spatio-temporal variations are investigated with the latest versions of three reanalysis data sets (that is, NCEP-DOE R2 and ERA-Interim, and MERRA-2). Our investigations suggest that the total mechanic energy of the global atmosphere did not significantly change during the past 35 years (1979â€“2013). However, the eddy energies display significant positive trends especially in the SH. In addition, positive trends are revealed in all conversion terms and generation/dissipation rates of energies during the past 35 years.</p>
