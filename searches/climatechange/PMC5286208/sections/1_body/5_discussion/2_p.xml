<p class="p">This study will help to understand the climate change in a broader perspective. The statistical analyses of the Lorenz energy cycle provide an important constraint on the climate change: the efficiency of Earth's atmosphere as a heat engine increased in response to the climate change (for example, global warming). Recently, there have been discussions of the efficiency of Earth's global atmosphere considered as a thermodynamic heat engine, in which the hydrological cycle was discovered to play an important role

Our analyses suggest that the dissipation of kinetic energies related to the atmospheric circulation also significantly contributes to the temporal variations of the efficiency of atmospheric heat engine. Climate change triggers intensified eddy and storm activities

The increased conversion rates are further balanced by increased generation/dissipation rates, so that finally the efficiency of the heat engine of the global atmosphere increased during the past 35 years.
