<p class="p">The means, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations of the variables are presented in

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). That is, higher perceived intractability of climate change was related to lower frequency of climate-friendly behavior over the past 6 months. In addition, there was a significant negative correlation between CCI and BCC (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = -0.269, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), as well as CCRP (
