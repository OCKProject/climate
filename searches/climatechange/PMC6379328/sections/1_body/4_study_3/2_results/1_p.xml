<p class="p">The means, standard deviations, and Pearson correlations of the variables are presented in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. An independent-samples 
 <italic class="italic">t-</italic>test was performed on the various measurements between the individualist and collectivist groups (see 
 <xref rid="T5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). As expected, the scores on the individualism dimension of the individualist group were significantly higher than were those of the collectivist group: 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(154) = 5.77, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> = 8.22, 95% CI = [5.40, 11.03], Cohen’s 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.95. Similarly, scores on the collectivism dimension of the individualist group were significantly lower than were those of the collectivist group, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(154) = -6.31, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> = -10.61, 95% CI = [-13.95, -7.28], Cohen’s 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = -1.04. No significant difference was found in BCC, CCR, or KCCA between groups (
