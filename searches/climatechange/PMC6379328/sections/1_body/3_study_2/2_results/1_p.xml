 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> presents the descriptive statistics. An independent-samples 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test was performed on PICC between the experimental and control groups. Consistent with the manipulation, there was a significant difference for PICC between the experimental and control groups, with the experimental group showing higher scores:
