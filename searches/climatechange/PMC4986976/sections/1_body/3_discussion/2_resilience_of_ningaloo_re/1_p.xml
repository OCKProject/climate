<p class="p">Unusually, Ningaloo Reef exhibits a naturally high level of macro-algal cover within the lagoon where both coral and macro-algal habitats exist side by side [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. This is typically an indicator of a reef in decline, however, high macro-algal cover is considered to be a healthy stable state for Ningaloo Reef [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Despite the naturally high occurrence, a recent study indicated that high macro-algal cover still impedes coral larvae settlement at Ningaloo [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>] and therefore reduces the ability for corals to recover following a bleaching event. Consequently, naturally high macro-algal cover, coupled with shallower water and less water mixing within the lagoon systems is a likely driver of the lower coral resilience values found in the lagoon areas.
