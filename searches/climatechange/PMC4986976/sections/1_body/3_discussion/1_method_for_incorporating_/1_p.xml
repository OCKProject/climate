<p class="p">As many existing marine parks have been established for several decades, there is a growing need for methods which enable an assessment of their management zones against the most recent scientific information, particularly with respect to climate change. This study demonstrates a method by which climate change resilience features can be defined, delineated and then incorporated into the incremental refinement of an existing marine reserve network for coral reefs and contributes to the limited research on the topic [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The availability of remotely-sensed, hyperspectral data provided a good opportunity to isolate resilience features at a high resolution over a large area. It provided resilience information on a much finer scale than similar research using remote sensing products [
