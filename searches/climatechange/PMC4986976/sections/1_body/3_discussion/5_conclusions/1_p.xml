<p class="p">Consideration of the predicted impacts of climate change in conservation planning is critical, yet, practical application is scarce. This study demonstrates that isolating features likely to confer resilience on a coral reef is feasible and, with the use of hyperspectral remote-sensing and modern acoustics, it can be achieved at high resolution across large study areas. As more empirical evidence regarding the factors that make coral reefs resilient becomes available, conservation planners can further refine resilience features and incorporate areas of high conservation significance within planned MPAs in a relatively straightforward manner. While it is still difficult to predict the impacts of climate change with any degree of certainty, it is imperative that resilience is incorporated into MPAs in order to have the highest probability of long-term persistence.</p>
