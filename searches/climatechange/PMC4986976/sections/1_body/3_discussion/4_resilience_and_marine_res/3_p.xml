<p class="p">Although the role no-take marine reserves play in increasing the resilience of reefs is still uncertain, and likely to be linked to a number of other variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref102" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">102</xref>], there are many measurable benefits directly linked to no-take reserves [

The prioritisation of the representation of highly resilient areas, or known areas of refuge to thermal stress, within reserve networks is therefore a sound precautionary principle and fundamental to achieve biodiversity conservation outcomes [
