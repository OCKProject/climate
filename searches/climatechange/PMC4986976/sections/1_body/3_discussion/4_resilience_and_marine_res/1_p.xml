<p class="p">There is some empirical evidence to suggest that coral reefs within marine reserves may be more resilient to the impacts of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Some areas within reserves have demonstrated an enhanced ability to recover following extreme weather events [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref099" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>] and Caribbean coral reefs within reserves were found to have significantly better recovery rates after a bleaching event than reefs without reserve protection [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The ability for reserves to increase ecosystem resilience to climate change beyond the reserve boundaries themselves is likely to be linked to how well the populations within reserves can enhance the recovery of downstream degraded areas through connectivity [
