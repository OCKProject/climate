<p class="p">Some highly resilient areas were represented within the current sanctuary zones. However, the shallow water habitat data were collected before the 2011 and subsequent 2012/13 bleaching events and, as such, the benthic composition and coral cover may have changed. For example, within the Bundegi sanctuary zone (

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. As such, in order to ensure effective adaptive management, a repeat survey, using the same hyperspectral and acoustic methods, could be implemented and included within the resilience framework developed by this study.
