<p class="p">Incremental reserve design has been found to be an effective tool for adaptive management [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. However, this study found similar results to Stewart et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref094" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">94</xref>], whereby incremental refinement required a larger area to meet targets than if a systematic conservation planning process was used without considering the existing zoning. While Airam√© et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">95</xref>] suggested removal of historic reserves if they were not included within systematic solutions, longevity is important for the success of reserves [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref096" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], and increases in the biomass of certain fish species within the current reserves at Ningaloo have already been recorded [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref097" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. Therefore, an iterative refinement of the existing no-take sanctuary zones is the best option for a more representative reserve system that encompasses areas critical for resilience to climate change induced disturbance.
