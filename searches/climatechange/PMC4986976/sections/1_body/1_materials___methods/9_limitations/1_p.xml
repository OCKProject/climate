<p class="p">Small gaps existed in the benthic datasets, which meant those areas would have been less likely to be included in the reserve network by Marxan. A number of studies have also incorporated SST variables when determining areas of thermal refugia for inclusion within reserves [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Although SST data could be useful to delineate thermal refuges in deeper environments, the resolution of remotely sensed SST data is relatively coarse and can be inaccurate in the shallow, nearshore and narrow lagoons found at Ningaloo. As the benthic datasets used in this study are very high resolution, in this instance, including SST data would detract from the high level of spatial resolution provided by the benthic datasets and thus was not included in this analysis.
