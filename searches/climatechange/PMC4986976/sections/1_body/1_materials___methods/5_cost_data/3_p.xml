<p class="p">Data detailing distribution of individual recreational activities such as fishing, diving and relaxing enabled a comprehensive socio-economic cost layer to be developed [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Values from each of the cost datasets (
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) were normalised and fishing values were then multiplied by 10 because displacement of fishing by no-take zones has the highest opportunity cost [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. All other values were left on a scale of 0â€“1 as the activities would not be displaced by the presence of a no-take sanctuary zone (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161094.s004" class="xref">S4 Table</xref>). Each of the cost data layers was then overlaid with the planning unit grid layer and summed to assign a single opportunity cost to each 1 km
