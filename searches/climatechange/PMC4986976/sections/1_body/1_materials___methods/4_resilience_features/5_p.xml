<p class="p">A test for correlation between each feature found high structural complexity to be strongly correlated with low macro-algal cover (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.98) and high live coral cover (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.77). High live coral cover and low macro-algal cover also had a positive correlation (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.67). These strong correlations could enable the resilience index to be simplified with high structural complexity acting as a surrogate with minimal reductions in accuracy. However, retaining the correlated features increased the irreplaceability of the planning units which contained all three features. With the ultimate aim of incorporating the planning units with the highest resilience within the reserve network, retaining all six features was considered preferable.
