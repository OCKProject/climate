 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] layer was utilised to map the water depth throughout the extent of the study area. It was also utilised to create a rugosity map, as a surrogate for habitat complexity, using the Benthic Terrain Modeller Tool for ArcGIS which creates an output of rugosity from digital elevation models. The rugosity values were reclassified into six structural complexity classes following similar criteria to those used by Graham et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] namely, 0 = no vertical relief, 1 = low and sparse relief, 2 = low but widespread relief, 3 = widespread moderately complex relief, 4 = widespread very complex relief and 5 = exceptionally complex relief.
