<p class="p">Reef passes, as an indicator for water mixing, were also determined through use of the 3.5 m pixel HyMap bathymetry data [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] and manually digitized in ArcGIS. Reef passes were defined as an opening between reef crests where depths &gt;5 m extended landward beyond the reef crest into the lagoon. Reef passes are &lt;1 km wide; any gaps &gt;1 km in width were considered to be larger reef breaks and are less likely to experience the strong current flow characteristic of reef passes at Ningaloo Reef [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Percentage cover of macro-algae and live coral was determined using the 3.5 m resolution shallow water benthic habitat maps which were limited to &lt;20 m depth [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Proximity to human activities [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] was calculated using the cost layer outlined below, and the normalised values were subsequently split into equal terciles of high, moderate and low.
