<p class="p">Marxan generates a summed solution output for each scenario which provides the selection frequency of each planning unit across all 10,000 repetitions. With a focus on iterative refinement of the existing no-take zones, these outputs for scenarios S2 and S4, and the difference between the two scenarios, were plotted in ArcGIS to determine which planning units had the highest selection frequency and, therefore, were most likely to be present in a final representative reserve design. In order to compare different design options, Marxan calculates an objective function score, which combines the boundary length, any penalties for not meeting targets, and the total cost for the reserve network [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. The ‘best’ solution outputs were plotted in ArcGIS and total area of the ‘best’ recommended reserve system calculated.
