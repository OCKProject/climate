<p class="p">ArcGIS was used to calculate the percentage of shallow water habitats and deeper water benthic communities currently represented within no-take sanctuary zones in the Marine Park. Marxan analyses, following standard methods [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>], were then undertaken to identify additional priority areas for inclusion within no-take sanctuary zones that would enable the 34% representation targets to be met. For each of the analyses, 10,000 repetitions and two million iterations were used and a high penalty value was set for each feature to ensure all objectives were achieved. The six resilience features were incorporated as additional conservation features similar to the method used by Levy and Ban [
