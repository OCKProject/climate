<p class="p">Ningaloo Reef (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161094.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) on Australia’s north-west coast is one of the largest fringing coral reefs in the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. At ~300 km long, it spans three degrees of latitude from 21°S to 24°S, encompasses a diverse range of habitats and has high species richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. The reef crest forms a discontinuous barrier along the coast, creating a lagoon with an average width of 2.5 km [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. At the southern and northern extents of the reef, the lagoons disappear and are replaced by extensive intertidal reef platforms [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The reef crest provides a buffer to the prevailing south-westerly winds and waves and is irregularly interspersed by reef passes allowing water circulation in and out of the lagoons [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The lagoons display high annual sea surface temperature variability of over 10°C in comparison to the relatively more stable temperatures within reef pass systems [
