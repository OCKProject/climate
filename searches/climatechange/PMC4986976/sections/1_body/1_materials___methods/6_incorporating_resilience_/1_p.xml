<p class="p">A commonly used systematic conservation planning software, Marxan (version 2.43) [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>], was used to incorporate the resilience values into a conservation planning exercise. Marxan is an open access software designed to solve the minimum set reserve design problem [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. It uses a simulated annealing algorithm with spatially derived planning units to find a set of near optimal reserve solutions which minimise socio-economic cost while meeting user-defined biodiversity targets (i.e. conservation features) [
