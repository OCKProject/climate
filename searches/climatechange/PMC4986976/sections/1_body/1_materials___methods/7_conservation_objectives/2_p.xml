<p class="p">With the same rationale used to define 34% targets for habitat types, a 34% target for features conferring high resilience was also used, assuming that these features represent areas most likely to resist and/or recover from future thermal disturbances and are therefore critical areas that require adequate representation within no-take sanctuary zones. Following examination of the literature, six relevant studies were chosen to identify the relative importance of each resilience feature ([

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0161094.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref> for rationale). As the perceived importance of individual features varied between authors, we used the same (34%) target for each resilience feature.
