<p class="p">Current international guidelines recommend that a target of 30â€“40% minimum representation of conservation features be included within no-take sanctuary zones [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. The existing management plan for Ningaloo Marine Park did not define any quantitative targets for the inclusion of specific habitat types within no-take sanctuary zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] and the final boundaries of these zones were delineated by negotiation with stakeholders, resulting in 34% of the total area of the Park being designated as no-take sanctuary zones. However, these zones are biased towards certain habitats and are unrepresentative of others [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In order to quantify this problem and recommend redress, we formulated a desired target of 34% representation within sanctuary zones of each benthic biodiversity feature. The target was based on the international guidelines previously mentioned, as well as the stakeholder negotiation previously undertaken in the Park.
