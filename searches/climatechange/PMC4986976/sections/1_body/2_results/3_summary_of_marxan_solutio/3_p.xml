<p class="p">The complete hierarchal cluster analysis of the top 100 solutions per scenario showed S5 (resilience features only without existing zones) was the most dissimilar to the other scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161094.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The second split was driven by whether the scenarios had existing sanctuary zones locked in. Finally, within the three scenarios that did have existing sanctuary zones locked in, S6 (resilience only) was separated from the scenarios which included the biodiversity targets (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161094.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The solutions generated by S1 and S3 and by S2 and S4, respectively showed no dissimilarity thus, for NMP, adding the resilience targets had little bearing on the Marxan solutions.
