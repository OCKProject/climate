<p class="p">Of the 46 shallow water habitat classes identified in the Ningaloo Marine Park [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], 45 had &gt;40% representation within current no-take sanctuary zones. The only habitat missing the target (patchy tabulate coral) accounted for a very small proportion of total habitat coverage (&lt;100 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and it is only found within the southern regions of the reef. Of the 16 deeper water benthic community classes, three were represented at &gt;34%, while most classes required small increases (1â€“6%) in representation within sanctuary zones. However, to attain the 34% target, a &gt;10% increase in area within no-take sanctuary zones is required for dense, sparse and medium filter feeder communities and dense sponge communities.
