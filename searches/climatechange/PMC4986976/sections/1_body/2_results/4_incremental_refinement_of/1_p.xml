<p class="p">The summed solution output for the S2 scenario identified areas of high selection frequency offshore in the region north of Point Cloates and in the southern reaches offshore from Gnaraloo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161094.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref>). There were a few planning units of high selection frequency in the northern region of the Marine Park corresponding to the area adjacent to Cape Range National Park and Exmouth and relatively evenly distributed areas of high selection frequency outside sanctuary zones throughout the rest of the Marine Park (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161094.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B</xref>) was only marginally different to the S2 scenario (Cohens Kappa = 0.798). The greatest increase in selection frequency following the addition of resilience features was off the coast of Coral Bay (
