<p class="p">It is broadly recognised that conservation planning for MPAs should attempt to incorporate resilience features while remaining adaptive to new research findings [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In particular, Game et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] argue that in order to achieve the best conservation outcomes, MPAs should be placed in areas most likely to be resilient to disturbance induced by climate change. While the growing need to address climate change resilience within marine conservation planning is well documented [

 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], there are many MPAs that were implemented before it became an important consideration. As such, there have been very few spatially explicit attempts to apply resilience theory to the incremental refinement of existing MPAs [
