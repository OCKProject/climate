<p class="p">Recent investment in research within the Park has resulted in spatially explicit datasets, which have provided an excellent opportunity to classify climate change resilience features, and to demonstrate one approach for integrating these features into an incremental refinement of the Parkâ€™s zonation within the existing adaptive management framework. The aims of this study were to identify any gaps in representation of benthic habitats within existing no-take sanctuary zones; to define and map climate change resilience features and to assess their representation in existing no-take sanctuary zones; and to conduct a spatial analysis using Marxan software to make incremental refinements of existing zones to ensure that the benthic and climate change resilience features are adequately represented within no-take sanctuary zones.</p>
