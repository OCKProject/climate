 <xref rid="pone.0161094.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], it has been found, in some cases, that the presence of well-enforced, no-take marine reserves may reduce the impacts of these threats, thereby increasing the resilience of marine ecosystems to disturbance caused by climate change [

More importantly, by including the most resilient areas within no-take marine reserves, particularly areas most likely to resist and/or recover from bleaching events, defined biodiversity conservation outcomes are more likely to be achieved into the future [
