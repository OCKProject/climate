   <italic class="italic">c</italic>) Schematic of the three most probable connection models in SDE analysis (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Posterior probabilities of models are noted in parentheses. Circles represent process layers, and arrows indicate causal directionality. Stippled arrows indicate a much weaker influence per time unit (electronic supplementary material).
