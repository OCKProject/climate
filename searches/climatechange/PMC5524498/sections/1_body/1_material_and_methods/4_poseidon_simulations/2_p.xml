<p class="p">Here, we evaluate the sensitivity of SCOR to changes in (i) spatial sampling completeness and (ii) the shape of the species rank-abundance distribution (RAD). Our simulation model (Poseidon) consists of a user-specified number of spatial cells (sites), number of time steps, total number of species (richness) and total number of individuals (abundance). In our simulations, we allow true richness and abundance to vary independently (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>), to highlight the key point that SCOR is unaffected by changes in richness. In each time step, we distribute individuals randomly among species, obeying a lognormal RAD. The RAD shape parameter (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) can be fixed or time-varying. We distribute individuals randomly among sites, and we sample only a proportion of the sites. This proportion increases from 0.1 to 0.4 through time (sampling coverage decreases with age), with any short-term sampling variability superimposed on this trend (
