<p class="p">To test our proposition that commonness can be more tractable than richness, we compare the performance of SCOR to richness estimators commonly used in palaeobiology. Poseidon therefore calculates raw richness (S), range-through richness (RT; assuming a species existed in all time bins between its first and last occurrence), Shannon entropy (H), and several sampling-standardized richness metrics, including classic rarefaction (CR), occurrences-squared weighted (O2W) [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]: SQS 3.3 (R script downloaded from the SQS website on 26 August 2014) and SQS 4.3 (perl script kindly provided by J. Alroy on 3 September 2014). We ran SQS 3.3 on sampled individuals (abundances) and SQS 4.3 on formatted Poseidon species occurrences, with a quorum level of 0.6 in all runs. Both SQS versions yielded very similar results when given the same type of data (abundances or occurrences). We used 100 iterations/trials in all subsampling methods (CR, O2W and SQS). Shannon H from the SQS 3.3 R script was used to calculate Pielou's J evenness. Goodness of fit between true and estimated richness, and between true abundance and SCOR, was measured by the coefficient of determination (
