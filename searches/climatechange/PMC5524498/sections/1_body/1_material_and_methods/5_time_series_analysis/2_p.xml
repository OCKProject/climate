<p class="p">If we take seriously the notion that climate-related oceanographic changes and planktonic ecosystems are interacting components of the Earth system, then we need to approach the possible long-term linkage between SCOR and DOT from a dynamical systems perspective. However, SCOR and DOT are both indirect proxy records that are not uniquely determined by any single physical or ecological process, and a dynamical coupling detectable in the proxy records would be a result of transitive chains of unobserved causal intermediates. In addition, the tectonic, climatic, atmospheric and biotic boundary conditions have all evolved over the Cenozoic. These challenges, combined with uncertainty in the relative importance and scales of mechanisms, limit the feasibility of explicit process modelling of a SCORâ€“DOT interaction throughout the Cenozoic. Instead, our approach is to test the hypothesis of a causal relationship using dynamical information inherent in the observed records, which enables us to advance beyond static correlations while avoiding unwarranted mechanistic assumptions.</p>
