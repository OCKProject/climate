<p class="p">Occurrences of macro- and microperforate planktonic foraminifera were retrieved from the Neptune Sandbox Berlin (NSB) database [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] (on 22 April 2015). SCOR was calculated using ⅓ Myr time bins, in order to maximize the number of temporal observations for time-series analysis, but our results also hold on a lower resolution of ½ Myr. In addition to a SCOR curve for 572 species in the original NSB taxonomy (updated in 2014 to match the taxonomic name list of the International Ocean Discovery Program), we calculated an ensemble of 20 SCOR curves that included from 81 to 100 of the most common species. To assess the robustness of SCOR to differences in taxonomic opinion, we established the set of 100 most common species using a different taxonomic scheme [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] and checked that the time intervals of commonness for these species in NSB were congruent with published stratigraphic ranges of each species after this taxonomic re-mapping [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 and table S1).
