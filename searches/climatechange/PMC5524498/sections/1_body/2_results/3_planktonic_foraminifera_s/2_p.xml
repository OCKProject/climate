The SCOR curve for the 572 original NSB species is statistically indistinguishable from the SCOR curve of the approximately 100 most common species, because SCOR is driven by the most common and widespread species. We based our final analyses on an ensemble of 20 SCOR curves, including from 81 to 100 of the most common species, after taxonomic remapping (electronic supplementary material, figure S2 and table S1). This SCOR ensemble was then compared with the Cenozoic DOT reconstruction (
