<p class="p">Estimates of SQS richness in the NSB data confirm the sensitivity to RAD shape found in Poseidon. Indeed, SQS richness can be reproduced by simply combining the raw richness and evenness curves, a relationship that holds for different taxa in NSB and across all Poseidon simulations (electronic supplementary material, figure S4). Changes in RAD shape are thus a significant confounding factor, at least for the specific subsampled richness algorithms tested here.</p>
