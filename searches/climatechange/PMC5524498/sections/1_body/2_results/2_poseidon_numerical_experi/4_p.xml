<p class="p">A data source like NSB, in which species occurrences were originally recorded for biostratigraphic purposes, is well suited for SCOR, because SCOR is only sensitive to common and widespread species, and biostratigraphically useful species are typically common and widespread. Nevertheless, we have included a Poseidon experiment where the recording of species (presence/absence) is random with respect to global commonness (electronic supplementary material, figure S5). Even in this scenario, which is designed to be particularly biased against it, SCOR still performs better than richness estimators. This experiment shows that we do not have to capture every abundant species for our approach to be meaningful.</p>
