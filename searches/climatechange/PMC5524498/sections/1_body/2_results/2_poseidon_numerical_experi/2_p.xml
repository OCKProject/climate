<p class="p">We find that SCOR is robust to variability in both spatial sampling and RAD shape (

 <italic class="italic">d</italic>), as well as variability in the abundance–occupancy relationship (electronic supplementary material, figure S1). As expected, raw S decays rapidly with increasing sampling variability, but is insensitive to changes in RAD shape (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>). RT is relatively robust to both factors, as the species pool and/or sampling is sufficient to avoid severe edge effects. Shannon H reflects both richness and evenness, and, with increasing 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> variability, H becomes more sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> than to changes in richness. O2W shows overall poor agreement with true richness. CR and SQS, being sampling standardization methods, are robust to the isolated effect of spatial sampling variability on richness, all else being equal. However, both CR and SQS are highly sensitive to changes in RAD shape. As with Shannon H, increasing 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> variability causes CR and SQS to lose track of richness (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170722F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>) and to respond to changes in 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> instead (electronic supplementary material, figure S3). In Poseidon, 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> variability is a white noise, entirely random with respect to both richness and abundance. Hence, the sensitivity of subsampling methods to RAD shape exists independently of how one might choose to measure sample evenness.
