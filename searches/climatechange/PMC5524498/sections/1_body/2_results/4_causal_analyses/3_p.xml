<p class="p">Using a series of linear SDEs to model correlation and causality between the two records, we recover relatively strong evidence that SCOR responds to changes in DOT, with a time lag of 0.33–1.1 Myr, in agreement with the CCM and IT analyses. Linear SDE analyses on SCOR and DOT individually show that the best descriptions for SCOR and DOT are a single-layer and a three-layer model, respectively (electronic supplementary material). We allowed for the possibility of a two-way connection in a statistical sense, because both proxies derive from the deep-sea carbonate record, which is a responsive component of the climate system and could, in principle, impart a shared signal. Consequently, there are 15 possible connection models, including the null hypothesis of no relationship (electronic supplementary material, figure S6). Posterior model probabilities provide substantial evidence for a causal connection between SCOR and DOT (electronic supplementary material). In the two most probable models (
