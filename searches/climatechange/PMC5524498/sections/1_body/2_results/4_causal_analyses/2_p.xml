<p class="p">Although the net trends are inversely related, fluctuations in SCOR and DOT do not show consistent negative or positive covariation throughout the Cenozoic (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). This result is consistent with a unidirectional forcing of SCOR by DOT, where predictability potentially goes both ways, but the causal direction peaks at negative lags [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. IT analysis supports this causal directionality: predictive information flow is significant from past DOT to SCOR, peaking at a negative lag of two to four time bins (approx. 1 Myr; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170722F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>). In the opposite direction, IT peaks at the corresponding positive lags, also consistent with unidirectional forcing. Both IT and CCM indicate a time-delayed coupling, but age model noise and the indirect nature of proxy records imply that the absolute magnitude of the lags cannot be given a strict physical interpretation. We therefore limit our interpretation to the sign of the peak lag to infer the directionality of the causal relationship.
