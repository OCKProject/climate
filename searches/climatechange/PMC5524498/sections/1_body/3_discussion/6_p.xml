<p class="p">In this paper, we have: (i) highlighted the importance of widespread species as indicators of global ecosystem response; (ii) shown that a simple measure of global occupancy can be used to track changes in global abundance, because widespread species are typically globally abundant (i.e. commonness, as we define it); (iii) shown that in the fossil record, commonness is more tractable than richness, because the same fundamental ecological property that lends power to commonness (i.e. only a few species are abundant and widespread) can be a weak spot for richness estimators; (iv) used dynamical information in global-scale proxy records to rigorously test the coarse-grained hypothesis of a causal relationship between observed global occupancy of planktonic foraminifera and long-term climate changes captured in DOT records; and (v) based on the quantitative evidence for a causal connection, put forward a more fine-grained hypothesis on the possible role of mixotrophy that we hope deserves future scrutiny.</p>
