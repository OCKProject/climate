<p class="p">The congruence of our three independent analyses provides strong quantitative evidence of a dynamical coupling between the observed global occupancy of planktonic foraminifera and past climatic and oceanographic changes captured in the DOT proxy record. A Cenozoic increase in ocean thermal stratification due to polar cooling has long been proposed as a secular abiotic forcing of plankton evolution [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Assimilating a Cenozoic DOT proxy in models of planktonic foraminifera diversification has also been found to increase model support [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], on time scales comparable with the predictive lags found here. However, we caution against reducing the DOT–SCOR coupling to any single mechanism operating through the evolving biotic, tectonic and atmospheric boundary conditions of the Cenozoic. Rather than attributing process to temporal correlations or net trends, we use information inherent in the data to demonstrate a dynamical coupling, while avoiding mechanistic assumptions. The magnitude of the predictive lag cannot be interpreted as a direct, physical process–response delay, but accommodates an indirect, heterogeneous causal pathway between DOT and SCOR. Our results instead open up new questions on the long-term dynamics of commonness and its linkage to environmental change. As an example, we briefly consider the ecological characteristics of the species responsible for the SCOR pattern.
