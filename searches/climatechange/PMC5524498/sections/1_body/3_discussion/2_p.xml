<p class="p">Occurrences in the NSB database stem from ocean drilling expedition shipboard data, and the presence of taxonomic and stratigraphic errors can be problematic for constructing range-based richness or phylogeny [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Our approach is much less sensitive to taxonomic and stratigraphic noise. Furthermore, we do not use local abundance data in NSB, which may be influenced by local fluxes and preservation, to reconstruct global abundance. Instead, SCOR is based only on global occupancy, integrated across widespread species, because globally widespread species are typically globally abundant (electronic supplementary material, figure S1

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As predicted from the hollow shape of species-abundance distributions, our results are reproducible with fewer than 100 of the most common species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170722F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). The overwhelming majority of species in NSB thus do not contribute to SCOR, and the use of different taxonomic schemes does not affect our results. SCOR does not depend on knowing true times of speciation and extinction; a species only contributes to SCOR if/when it is widespread, and stratigraphic outliers or long tails of occurrences, erroneous or not, have no impact. Hence, we need not distinguish between a species having gone truly extinct and it having become a rare, ecological ‘ghost’, like the coccolithophore

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. In addition, even if morphospecies do not conform strictly to biological species, they may represent successful phenotypes and/or traits that potentially link global abundance to ecosystem functioning. We use SCOR for its simplicity and consider it a starting point for more sophisticated occupancy-based approaches [
