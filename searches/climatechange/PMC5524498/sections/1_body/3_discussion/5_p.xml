<p class="p">Planktonic foraminifera inferred to host symbionts in the open-ocean mixed layer (Ecogroup 1 in [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]) are among the most widespread species that contribute to high SCOR during intervals of relative DOT warmth (i.e. positive deviations from the net DOT trend), especially the early Eocene and the late Miocene–Pliocene (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20170722F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>; electronic supplementary material, figure S2). By contrast, deeper-dwelling species not known to host symbionts contribute most to SCOR during intervals of relative DOT cooling, such as the latest Eocene–Oligocene and, in the case of thermocline-dwelling species, the mid-Miocene. Symbiont-hosting (mixotrophic) rhizarian protists are surprisingly abundant in oligotrophic oceans today [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. If oligotrophic realms expand with surface warming in the near future [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], then the global abundance of mixotrophs could increase. Greater global abundance of mixotrophs might enhance the efficiency of the biological carbon pump in the ocean, through net increases in body size and faster sinking rates [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Although the global biogeochemical impact of planktonic foraminifera may be limited, their outstanding fossil record makes them a prime candidate for studying a planktonic ecosystem response to global environmental changes in the past. Despite the opposite net trends, long-term fluctuations in SCOR and DOT show intervals of positive covariation, suggesting that planktonic foraminifera proliferated in periods of relative DOT warmth. To the extent that long-term patterns in the DOT record reflect Cenozoic mean states of surface water temperature (e.g. early Eocene warming followed by long-term Eocene cooling), and if, on average, warmer water conditions correspond to lower nutrient levels, then mixotrophy may have allowed the global abundance of planktonic foraminifera to increase in a warmer ocean. In the warm early Eocene, for example, oligotrophic open-ocean ecosystems may have reached mid- and high latitudes [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. If higher global abundance of mixotrophic plankton was associated with greater efficiency of the biological carbon pump [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], then the SCOR pattern would be consistent with the sharpened δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C depth gradients observed in the warm early–mid–Eocene [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], and the reduction of δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C depth gradients from the warm Pliocene to the cooler Pleistocene [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. We propose that mixotrophy has been an ecological factor linking the global abundance of planktonic foraminifera to the relative extent of oligotrophic oceans. Testing this hypothesis calls for spatially resolved proxy data and spatially explicit occupancy modelling, which are out of the scope of this study.
