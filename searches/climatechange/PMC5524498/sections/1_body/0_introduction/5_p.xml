<p class="p">Turning to the rich deep-sea sedimentary record of the Cenozoic era (0â€“65 Ma), we apply SCOR to global occurrences of planktonic foraminifera, a calcifying unicellular zooplankton group of central importance to our understanding of Cenozoic climate history. The taxonomy of planktonic foraminifera is based on test (shell) morphology, and despite the presence of cryptic diversity, the validity of extant morphological taxa is generally supported by ribosomal sequence data [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Global patterns of morphospecies richness of extant planktonic foraminifera have been linked to various environmental factors, including sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, productivity, geography and ocean currents [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. On Cenozoic time scales, fossil diversity dynamics in planktonic foraminifera have been linked to a combination of ecological traits and oxygen isotope records via statistical model selection [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], or correlated to changes in deep-sea sedimentation [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The dynamics of global commonness, on the other hand, have remained unexplored.
