<p class="p">Major oceanographic regime changes, linked to climatic and tectonic processes, have occurred on geological time scales. Geological archives may thus provide insights into how global environmental changes have impacted ocean biomes, as preserved in the sedimentary record. Declining abundance of common species may have dramatic impacts on ecosystem functioning [

However, efforts to link past climatic and oceanographic changes to planktonic biota in deep time have remained focused on temporal changes in species richness [
