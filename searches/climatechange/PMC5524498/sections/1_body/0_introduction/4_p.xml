<p class="p">We seek to redress the situation by targeting species that are globally common and widespread at any given time, using the Summed Common species Occurrence Rate (SCOR). SCOR sums the observed occupancy (the proportion of sampled sites at which a species is present and observed) across a species set and is driven by the most widespread species in the set [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In general, widespread species are also abundant [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and a positive relationship between global abundance and occupancy is found in the global ocean plankton [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], including the planktonic foraminifera (electronic supplementary material, figure S1
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). Here, we define commonness as high global site occupancy, and show that if the global abundance–occupancy relationship is positive (albeit noisy), then SCOR is a proxy for relative changes in global abundance integrated over the total set of species included. We do not consider local abundances or geographical ranges of individual species. A species contributes to SCOR only if and when it is widespread, which accommodates the geological transience of commonness; in the fossil record, species and higher taxa generally show a gradual expansion and contraction of their spatial extent of occurrence, being rare (restricted) in the early and late stages of their known stratigraphic range [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Furthermore, species that make up the bulk of the fossil record, and biostratigraphically useful species in particular, tend to be common and widespread.
