<p class="p">We propose that changes in the commonness of the most common species may represent a more tractable and meaningful measure of past ecosystem response to environmental forcing than those in the estimated total number of species. As a measure of potential physical forcing, we use a reconstruction of changes in deep-ocean temperature (DOT) throughout the Cenozoic [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. We use the DOT record because it is a robust, globally meaningful signal of long-term changes, compatible with our integrated, global-scale analysis. Temperature proxy records for the surface ocean show considerable spatial heterogeneity [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and would call for a spatially explicit analysis, which is not considered here. Geological proxy records are generally noisy mixtures of signals that represent multiple processes and are derived from a sedimentary record that is itself an active component of the Earth system. Any causal connection detected between proxy records would necessarily be indirect with respect to the underlying processes of interest. Nonetheless, the DOT proxy record of high-latitude and deep-water temperature reflects a set of interlinked, climate-related oceanographic variables, including changes in geographical and vertical thermal structure, considered to be important physical controls on the long-term evolution of planktonic foraminifera [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Here, we find evidence of a dynamical coupling between planktonic foraminifera SCOR and DOT using three conceptually very different methods for detecting causality in time series.
