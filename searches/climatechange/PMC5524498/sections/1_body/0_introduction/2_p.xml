<p class="p">True species richness can be elusive even in well-studied ecosystems, because most species are very rare, and relatively few species account for most of the total abundance [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. For example, only approximately 1.4% of the estimated tree species account for half of the biomass of the Amazon forest and control the cycling of water, carbon and nutrients [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Similarly, a recent survey of eukaryotic plankton diversity in the global ocean found that approximately 0.24% of the taxa accounted for half of the total number of rDNA reads [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. The relative richness of major trophic groups in the plankton is similar across ocean basins, and codiversification of protistan parasites, mutualistic symbionts and their hosts suggests an important role for ecological (‘biotic’) interactions in driving global plankton diversity [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Oceanographic (‘abiotic’) factors, on the other hand, such as differences in nutrient levels among ocean basins, are more clearly reflected in the abundance of major groups [

 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. For example, the species richness of diatoms is comparable across nutrient-rich coastal waters and oligotrophic oceans, but their abundance is strikingly different in high- and low-nutrient settings [
 <xref rid="RSPB20170722C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. These first-order patterns of richness and abundance in global eukaryotic plankton suggest that long-term environmental forcing of global abundance, such as an increase in the global abundance of low-nutrient adapted groups in response to an expansion of oligotrophic conditions, can be independent of any change in richness.
