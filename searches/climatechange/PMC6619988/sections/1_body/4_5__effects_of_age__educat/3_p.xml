<p class="p">Women accept the reality of ACC at higher rates than men do in our New Hampshire data, but other sex differences in 
 <xref rid="pone.0217608.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> are not significant. 
 <italic class="italic">Education</italic>, like 
 <italic class="italic">age</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">year</italic>, affects responses across all four models. Because 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic> appears also in interactions with 
 <italic class="italic">ideology</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">party</italic>, these main effects from 
 <italic class="italic">education</italic> (with odds ratios significantly above 1.0) represent the positive influence of education among political moderates (
 <italic class="italic">ideology</italic> = 0) or Independents (
 <italic class="italic">party</italic> = 0). Moderates or Independents who have college educations are more likely than their peers to support renewable energy, and to think that ACC is real. By similar reasoning, the main effects of 
 <italic class="italic">ideology</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">party</italic> represent the effects of these characteristics among respondents who completed technical school or some college (
 <italic class="italic">education</italic> = 0).
