 <italic class="italic">E. guineensis</italic> distribution in Reference [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. A total of 2465 records were used in fitting the parameters. These records may be described as geographically representative of the known distribution of the species. The global study used CSIRO-Mk3·0 and MIROC-H GCM global climate models (GCMs) to model potential future distribution of oil palm. CLIMEX in conjunction with the A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), a mechanistic niche model using CLIMEX software supports ecological research incorporating the modeling of species’ potential distributions under differing climate scenarios and assumes that climate is the paramount determining factor of plant and poikilothermal animal distributions. CLIMEX output categorized areas according to highly suitable climate (HSC), suitable climate, marginal climate, and unsuitable climate based on other studies through CLIMEX.
