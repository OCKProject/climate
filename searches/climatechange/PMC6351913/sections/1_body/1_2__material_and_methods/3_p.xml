<p class="p">Future suitable climate scenarios for oil palm growth in Indonesia are described fully in Paterson et al. [

 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Briefly, the distribution model for oil palm under current and future climate scenarios was developed using CLIMEX for Windows Version 347 (Hearne Scientific Software Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia, 2007). Climate data and climate change scenarios were carried out using the CliMond 10Â´gridded climate data. The potential future climate was characterized using the same five variables based on two global climate models (GCMs), CSIRO-Mk3.053 and MIROC-H (Centre for Climate Research, Japan) with the A1B and A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) in Reference [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. These were available as part of the CliMond dataset. CLIMEX parameters were fit using the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, a database of natural history collections from around the world for various species. Information on the global distribution of oil palm was downloaded and used in parameter fitting. A total of 124 records were used. South East Asian distribution data were reserved for validation of the model.
