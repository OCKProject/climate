 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] considered Malaysia and Indonesia, where 85% of oil palms are grown and which effectively constitute the modern industry. Indonesia produces somewhat more than Malaysia. However, Paterson et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] considered the situation for all oil palm growing regions, including SE Asia, Latin America, and Africa, despite their production being only 15% of total when Indonesia and Malaysia are not considered. The current paper focused on Sumatra, which is a large producer within Indonesia, and which was not considered in isolation before in Paterson et al. [
