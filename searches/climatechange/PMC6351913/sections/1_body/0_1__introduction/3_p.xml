<p class="p">The industry is threatened by various diseases. Basal stem rot (BSR) caused by the fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma boninense</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00024-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) has caused severe disease problems for over 80 years [
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] and is the most serious disease in Indonesia. BSR is unimportant in other, much lower, palm oil producing regions outside of SE Asia. The current level of disease can be considered as containable, especially compared to the situation if the palms were growing under a suboptimal or unsuitable climate [

 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The climate worldwide has changed over this period, which has been discussed frequently by the current author [

 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma</italic> are variable [
