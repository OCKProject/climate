<p class="p">Furthermore, the crop will experience generalized climate stress in Sumatra after 2050, leading to more BSR [

 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,

 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Cold stress in current time for growing oil palm in Sumatra was localized largely in mountainous regions, as might be expected, amounting to ca. 10% of Sumatra [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This becomes almost absent by 2100, indicating that oil palm could be grown in these regions, possibly with lower BSR. When crops are moved to new regions, the levels of disease can decrease from the “parasites lost” phenomenon [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. However, other factors will determine if oil palms can be grown in mountainous regions, such as the slope of land and type of soil. There is no heat stress at present: This will become apparent in ca. 5% of Sumatra towards the south east in 2100 [
 <xref rid="B13-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. It is likely that oil palm will not grow in that region and, consequently, BSR will be irrelevant. There was no dry stress at present in Sumatra, but data were not available for 2100. The equivalent data in Reference [
 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-07-00024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] indicated there were none of these stresses in 2050 and 2100, although the definition of the world maps was lower.
