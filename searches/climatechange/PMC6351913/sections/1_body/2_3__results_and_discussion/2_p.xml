 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00024-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref> indicates the levels of suitable and highly suitable climate together and highly suitable climate alone for growing oil palm in Sumatra. The projected levels of 
 <italic class="italic">G. boninense</italic> infection are also provided. The infection will increase significantly because of the decrease in the suitability of the climate for growing oil palm as discussed in References [

 <italic class="italic">G. boninense</italic>. The suitability of the climate for oil palm growth slightly will increase until 2050, indicative of mountainous regions having an increasingly suitable climate. However, by 2070, there will be a decrease in highly suitable climate, until a very low level is reached by 2100. There will be a fairly small increase in basal stem rot from 41% until 2050, after which time, the increase will be dramatic. The disease level will reach 100% by 2100.
