For example, the palms could be grown in novel regions outside of SE Asia, where the disease is at low levels, although many of these regions will become unsuitable for growing oil palm under projected climate change. Other factors pertaining to sustainability of the global production of oil palm maybe that the palm could adapt or be adapted by cross-breeding. Genetic manipulation may also be beneficial in the future. The use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with and without reduced tillage, cover crops, biochar, empty fruit bunch application, etc. [
