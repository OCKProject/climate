<p class="p">The situation for Central Sumatra is more serious than in all of Sumatra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00024-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The level of disease is higher at the current time and will increase slightly until 2050. The suitability of the climate will decrease at a very high rate for oil palm and highly suitable climate will decrease to a very low level. The amount of disease will increase rapidly to 100% at 2100. The situation in South Sumatra was similar to that in Central Sumatra (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00024-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The rapid deterioration in suitable climate for oil palm together with the rapid rise in disease will make oil palm unsustainable after 2050 but long before 2100 in most of Sumatra. However, the suitable climate for North Sumatra has a different pattern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="microorganisms-07-00024-f007" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). There was a low level of highly suitable and suitable climate of ca. 40% probably because of the large number of mountains within this region, with an associated unsuitable climate for growing oil palms. The suitable climate for oil palm will increase linearly until 2050 as the mountainous climate becomes more suitable. The region may become suitable for growing oil palm, but other factors, such as soil type or the slope of the mountains, will affect the ability to grow oil palm. This requires further assessment. The level of disease will increase gradually from 40% to 70% by 2100. Hence, North Sumatra may be more sustainable than the other regions.
