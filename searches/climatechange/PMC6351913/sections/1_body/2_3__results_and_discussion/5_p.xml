<p class="p">Two paths resulting in more disease with projected climate change are recognized herein: (a) An increase in virulence of 
 <italic class="italic">G. boninense</italic> and (b) an unsuitable climate for oil palm, making it less resistant to disease. Oil palm in Sumatra will be detrimentally affected by a less suitable climate from 2050 onwards, leading to a high increase in BSR. This indicates a greater risk of unsustainability when the suitable climate and BSR levels are considered. The situation is exacerbated when the virulence of 
 <italic class="italic">G. boninense</italic> is considered, with deterioration beginning after 2030 in some cases. The situation in Sumatra acts as a model for other oil palm growing regions in SE Asia.
