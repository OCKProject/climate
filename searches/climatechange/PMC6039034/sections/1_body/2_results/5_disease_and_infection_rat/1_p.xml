<p class="p">Witchesâ€™ broom was first recorded in Bahia in 1989 and has resulted in a big reduction of cocoa production since. At the beginning of the study (April 2015), the fungal infection caused about a 15% pod loss. However, during the drought the loss was much higher: 36% in April 2016 and 35% in April 2017 after the drought.</p>
