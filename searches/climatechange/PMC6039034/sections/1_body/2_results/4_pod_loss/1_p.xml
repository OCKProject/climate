<p class="p">The average potential yield per area (based on pod number) on the 31 farms, for the main harvest (of two per year) in April 2015 before the drought, was 242 (± 25) kg/ha. During the drought, in April 2016, the average potential yield was 26 (± 9) kg/ha—an 89% reduction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200454.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Nine months after the drought ended in July 2016, the potential yield in April 2017 was still 83% lower than in April 2015. The drought dramatically decreased the number of pods per tree. The 15% mortality of productive cocoa trees caused 11% of the 89% loss.
