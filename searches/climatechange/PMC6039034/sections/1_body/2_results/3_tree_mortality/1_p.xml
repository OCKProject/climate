<p class="p">Cocoa tree mortality was 15% (±2.3 SE) during the ENSO event as compared to &lt;1% normally (Bastide et al. 2008). In a further 5% (±1.2 SE) of the trees the large productive stems died but suckers remained alive. Cocoa mortality differed between groups 28% in hybrids, 22% in ‘common’ cocoa and 15% in ‘clones’ (χ

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Shade tree mortality during the drought was 7% of the 317 woody shade trees on the transects; no species of shade trees was particularly affected. There were also 337 banana trees before the drought in March 2015 but these normally have a short lifespan (6 to 14 months), so it is not possible to say how many died of drought.
