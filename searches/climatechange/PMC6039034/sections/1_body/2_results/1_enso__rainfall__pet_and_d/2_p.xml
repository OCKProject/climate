<p class="p">Comparing the 30-day rainfall totals with the Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200454.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) showed two very long episodes, separated by 25 days, when PET &gt; rain: September 2015 to January 2016 (136 days) and February 2016 to end of June 2016 (131 days). From July 2016 rainfall returned to approximately equal PET–the average situation except for December 2016 until February 2017, when PET exceeded rainfall (

Expressing the same rainfall data in a different way as the ‘standardized precipitation-evapotranspiration index’ (SPEI) showed two episodes of negatives values during ENSO 2015–16 including 4 months with SPEI&lt; -2 and with an extreme deviation of -3.2 in November 2015 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200454.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). These are exceptional values, SPEI was &lt;- 2 during only 4 months in the past 168 months (14 years). More recently the lowest values for SPEI have been decreasing, indicating stronger droughts since 2001.
