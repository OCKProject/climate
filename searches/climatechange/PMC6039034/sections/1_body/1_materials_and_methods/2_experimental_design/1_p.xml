<p class="p">From the 333 traditional cocoa farms listed in CEPLAC (Executive Commission of the Cocoa Farming Plan, the government organisation part of the ministry of agriculture in charge of research and technical support for Brazilian cocoa production) rural census for Barro Preto, we chose 31 at random, amounting approximately 1760 ha of the area planted with cocoa. In March 2015, we established permanent transects of 8 m x 100 m in areas defined as representative of each farm by the farm administrator. GPS coordinates of the transects were recorded. All cocoa trees and woody shade trees &gt; 1.5 cm of DBH (&gt; 5 cm of circumference) at 1.3 m above ground were measured and identified with tags. Cocoa tree and shade tree densities were on average 622 (± 33 SE) and 126 (± 12 SE) per hectare respectively. Shade level was estimated by measuring the gap fraction (and the inverse ground cover) using hemispherical photos: one photo was taken every 10 m along the 100 m transect, above the cocoa tree but below the shade tree canopy to measure average percentage of ground cover per transect. We used an EOS 5D Nikon camera with a hemispherical lens, attached to a telescopic gimbal. All photos were analysed using Canopy analyser HEMIv9–HemiView, delta-T, Cambridge, UK.</p>
