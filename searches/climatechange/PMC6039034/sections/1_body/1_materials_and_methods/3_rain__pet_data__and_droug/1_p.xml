<p class="p">Rainfall and temperature data were recorded at MCCS weather station from January 2001 to February 2017. All farms were located within 15 km of MCCS. The PET was calculated from temperature using FAO ET0 calculator Version 3.2, September 2012 [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This calculator, based on the Penman-Monteith equation, uses average, minimum and maximum day temperature as minimum data inputs. (Average PET/month 
 <sub class="sub">2001–2016</sub> = 111 mm). We calculated the sum of average rainfall for the 30 preceding days to compare it with the sum of PET for the 30 preceding days. When the sum of the 30 preceding days of rain was less than the sum of the 30 preceding days of PET, we considered that the cocoa trees where facing a drought event. We compared water balance (rain, PET and soil water holding capacity) for a two-year period during ENSO (March 2015 to February 2017), which was the worst two-year drought since 2001 including the ENSO of 2008 (May 2007 to April 2009). The severity of the 2015–16 drought was also assessed using the widely used Standardized Evapotranspiration Precipitation Index (SPEI), calculated from the SPEI package in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], and 15 years of MCCS rainfall as input data. We used the database from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to identify the duration of El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events and to classify their strength using the Oceanographic El Niño Index (ONI), based on anomalies in Sea Surface Temperature (SST): weak (0.5 to 0.9°C SST anomaly), moderate (1 to 1.4°C SST anomaly), strong (1.5 to 1.9°C SST anomaly) and very strong (&gt;1.9°C SST anomaly).
