<p class="p">The fungal infection rate (mainly caused by 
 <italic class="italic">Moniliophthora perniciosa</italic> but also infrequently by 
 <italic class="italic">Phytophthora palmivora</italic>) was assessed by recording the number of rotten pods on each tree. 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">perniciosa</italic> primarily affects the leaves and vegetative development, but also impacts directly cocoa pods. The November 2015 harvest was not recorded for logistic reasons. Potential losses due to drought and disease were calculated by comparing the number of pods counted during harvests during and after the drought with the number of pods counted during harvest before the drought.
