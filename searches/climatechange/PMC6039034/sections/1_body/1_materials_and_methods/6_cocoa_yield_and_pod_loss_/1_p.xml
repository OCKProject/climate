<p class="p">The number of cocoa pods on tree counted before the bi-annual harvests in the transects was used as a proxy to estimate an average potential yield per harvest. The number of cocoa pods (length &gt; 10 cm to exclude numerous small fruits that fall before reaching 10 cm) was counted on each tree before the harvest by the farmers in April 2015, April 2016, November 2016 and April 2017. Pod number on trees in the 800 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> transects was scaled up to one hectare to calculate an average potential yield in kg/ha for each farm. (We considered that the cocoa and shade tree densities within the transects were representative of the farms). Potential yield was estimated using a conversion factor of 40 g of dry cocoa beans per healthy cocoa pod before the drought and 23 g of dry cocoa beans per healthy cocoa pod during after the drought (a relationship established for cocoa in the area). Both averages were calculated based on ripe cocoa pod sampling from Barro Preto farms respectively before the drought (May 2012) and at the end of the drought (May 2016). Approximately 30 pods were opened, fresh beans were fermented 5 days, sun-dried for about a week before being weighted.
