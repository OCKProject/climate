<p class="p">Management practices are usually limited to harvesting and occasionally pruning and manual weeding. Fertiliser and pesticides use are unusual. Most farms use herbicides (Glyphosate) to delay and reduce regrowth after manual weeding. During the study, manure fertilisation was applied in only 2 of the 31 farms. Cocoa trees were pruned annually after the main harvest in most farms.</p>
