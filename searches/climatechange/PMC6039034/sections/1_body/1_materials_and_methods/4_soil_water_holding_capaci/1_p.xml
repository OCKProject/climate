<p class="p">We measured soil water holding capacity in the middle of each transect in 10 of the 31 farms in April 2017. Because of limited resources and time, we could not make measurement in all 31 farms. In situ soil had its roots cut (in the top 5 cm of soil) was saturated with water one day and samples were collected the next day from the top 60 cm (0–20, 20–40, 40–60 cm). Samples were fresh weighed and then dried for 3 days at 90°C and reweighed. The difference in weight allowed us to calculate the water content, (m
 <sub class="sub">water</sub> = m
 <sub class="sub">wet</sub>-m
 <sub class="sub">dry</sub>, with m
 <sub class="sub">water</sub>: mass of water, m
 <sub class="sub">wet</sub>: mass of wet soil and m
 <sub class="sub">dry</sub>: mass of dry soil). This mass of water was converted into water depth (mm), at field capacity using the formula h = V/ (π x r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) with h: water height in the soil core in mm, V = volume of water in mm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> and r = radius of soil core (15 mm). One of the ten farms was excluded because the soil was extremely rocky.
