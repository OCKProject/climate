<p class="p">The number of dead cocoa trees was recorded in the middle of the second drought in April 2016 and compared to the number of live cocoa trees recorded in April 2015. Dead trees were recorded again in November 2017 and additional mortality was marginal (1.7%). The mortality rate of the cocoa trees (

 <sup class="sup">1/t</sup> where N
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is the number of trees at the beginning of the interval, N
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> the number of trees that died after one year (time t = 1 year). Cocoa trees were classified into 3 groups by MCCS technicians based on field characteristics: 1) ‘common’—Amazonian Amelonado including Marañon and Para the varieties most commonly found in Bahia; 2) ‘clones’, grafted or rooted cuttings of identified clones such as CCN51, TSH1188, PH16 or PS1319 selected by research institutes; and 3) hybrids, seed material produced in the 1960’s by CEPLAC mainly from hybridization of the ‘clones’ and other varieties.
