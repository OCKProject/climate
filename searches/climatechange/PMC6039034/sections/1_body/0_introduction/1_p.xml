 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. There is still an active discussion and a high uncertainty about the impact of climate change on ENSO frequency and intensity. Some climate change scenarios predict an increase in extreme events, including an increased frequency of strong El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events [
