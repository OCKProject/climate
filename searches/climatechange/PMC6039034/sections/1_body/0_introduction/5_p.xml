<p class="p">Our study measured the effect of a severe ENSO-related drought on cocoa trees in randomly chosen farms in the traditional cocoa producing area in the Northeast of Brazil, where 75% Brazilian cocoa is grown. The region has been affected by severe ENSO-related droughts in the past, however the severity of 2015–16 ENSO-related drought was unprecedented. Our major concern is that ENSO-related droughts are threatening cocoa production in traditional agroforests in the area in the long-term. We used permanent transects to measure the effect of a very strong drought on cocoa trees in 31 randomly-chosen farms with traditional cocoa agroforestry systems. To our knowledge, this is the first on-farm study of the effect of a severe natural drought on adult cocoa trees where cocoa was compared before and after an ENSO event. We expected to find reductions in cocoa yield and thus that predicted increases in drought are likely to cause major reductions in cocoa yield in the coming decades as the climate changes and strong droughts increase. Forest drought has recently emerged as a research priority [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]; drought effects on cocoa agroforestry could be a ‘canary in the coal mine’ warning of problems to come both in agriculture and in semi-natural and natural vegetation due to increased intensity and frequency of droughts in a changing world climate.
