<p class="p">Cocoa is described as being sensitive to drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], but there are few field-studies on the effect of drought on cocoa. Published studies of cocoa bean yields and their decrease due to ENSO-related droughts are based on interviews with farmers and/or official national statistical data. In Sulawesi, it was found that ENSO-related drought caused a 62% loss of cocoa production compared to their usual levels—based on data provided by the farmers [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In West Africa 27% loss compared to a normal year was reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], but this loss was mainly due to a decrease in the planted area due to forest fires, it was not much caused by lower production in drought affected cocoa trees. In Ecuador, 19% loss of cocoa planted area was found as a result of the 1997–98 ENSO [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. A physiological production model compiling data from 30 sites in 10 cocoa producing countries, concluded that water limitation was responsible for 50% loss in yield [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. A climate change model for West African cocoa production [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] predicted that the possible decrease in area suitable for growing cocoa by 2050 was mainly due to increased temperature and surprisingly not due to a decrease in rainfall. Overall these reports show that many areas have strong reductions in cocoa production due to drought though none of the studies is based on detailed research of the effects of drought on cocoa trees on farms.
