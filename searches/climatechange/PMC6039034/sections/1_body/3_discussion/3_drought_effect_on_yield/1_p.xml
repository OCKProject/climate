<p class="p">Potential yield losses in 2016 and 2017 were about 89% compared to the harvest in April 2015 before the drought. The decreases are much higher than the decrease in annual cocoa yield reported for the state of Bahia from 2015–2016 (about 30%: 298 to 207 kg. ha
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The difference could be due to one of several, non-mutually exclusive, reasons. Firstly, our farms may have been unusually affected by the drought as compared to the rest of the state of Bahia; we cannot test this but point out that our farms were a random sample from 333 farms in the Barro Preto region (160 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) however this is only 0.5% of the cocoa region of the State of Bahia (32,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and though the area sampled was large (16 km West to East and 10 km North to South) it is small compared to the ‘cocoa area’ of Bahia. Secondly, it could be that in wetter parts of the cocoa region of Bahia (i.e. in the North: Salvador) the ENSO-related drought had little effect or even increased growth because in wetter areas, the potential reduction in yield due to some drought may be overwhelmed by the increased production resulting from increased solar radiation. Thirdly, drought may cause abnormally high leaf loss in shade trees, which has two effects it potentially somewhat reduces water use by the shade trees and it also lets more light through to the cocoa trees below, thus increasing yield (a situation found in liana seedlings in semi-evergreen rain forest in Panama where a stronger dry season resulted increased seedling growth, [
