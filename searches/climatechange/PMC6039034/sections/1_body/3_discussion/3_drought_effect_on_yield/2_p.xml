<p class="p">There seems to be only one other on-farm study of the effect of drought on cocoa yield—an experimental drought, simulating an ENSO event, in Indonesia, where rooves reduced rainfall by about 78% over 13 months, when the actual rainfall was 2937mm. In this experiment, there were no extended periods without rain and the ‘relative extractable water’ from the soil only reached close to zero for one month near the end of the experimental drought. Cocoa yield was only reduced by 10%, though interestingly yield was reduced by 45%

By contrast, in our study of natural drought we had an 89% lower yield and a 15% cocoa tree mortality; the large differences between the studies were probably due to the fact that our natural drought was much stronger (136 and 131 days with PET &gt; rain versus 32 and 60 days under the shelters in the Indonesian experiment).
