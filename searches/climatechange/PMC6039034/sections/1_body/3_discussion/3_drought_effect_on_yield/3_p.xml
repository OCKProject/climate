<p class="p">The direct effect of the drought (low water availability in soil) was to reduce the cocoa pod production and to kill many cocoa trees. Additionally, the drought could have had indirect effects on cocoa yield which were not measured during the experiment. For example, the drought could have affected the cocoa pollinator populations causing an indirect reduction in cocoa yield. In the artificial drought experiment in Indonesia, the results of hand-pollinations were not affected by the drought. However, pollination intensity was a main factor limiting yield in both roof and control plots [

In Bahia, the prolonged ENSO drought could have affected pollinator breeding and habitats, reducing the pollination intensity and thence indirectly reducing the cocoa yield. Furthermore, the drought could have modified the organic matter decomposition on cabruca soil. This could have limited the access to nutrients for the cocoa trees, indirectly reducing their yield.
