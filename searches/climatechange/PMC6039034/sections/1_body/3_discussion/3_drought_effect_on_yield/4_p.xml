<p class="p">In addition to the direct and indirect effects of drought reducing cocoa tree growth and pod production, drought was associated with an increase in disease infection rate (15% of all pods before the drought to 30% during the drought). Rotten pods resulting from disease contributed significantly (35% of the total April 2017 harvest) to the reduction in the number of pods counted after the drought. This increase in infection rate was also observed in the artificial drought experiment in Indonesia [
