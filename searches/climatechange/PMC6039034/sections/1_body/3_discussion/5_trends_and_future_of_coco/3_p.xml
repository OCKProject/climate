<p class="p">Thus, we have shown, for the first time on-farm, that a severe El Niño drought reduced cocoa production by 89% for the main (April) harvests in 2016 and 2017, and killed 15% of cocoa trees. Strong droughts are not uncommon in Bahia Brazil, but an eleven-months event with two successive droughts of 136 and 131 days (separated by 25 days) was unique. It is likely that such droughts will become longer and more frequent in the tropics and thus cocoa yields in such areas will be strongly reduced. Cocoa is an example of many crops grown somewhat beyond their normal climatic range; which are sensitive to drought and whose yields might be greatly reduced in future due to changed climates with stronger and more frequent droughts. Such crops could be the ‘canaries in the coal mine’ warning of problems to come due to increased intensity and frequency of droughts [
