 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Only extreme ENSO events cause reduced cocoa yield in Bahia. ENSO events are often associated with yield losses in crops due to drought but also to flooding [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. ENSO events are also responsible for losses in vegetation cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] and are a threat to tropical forests [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Forest mortality due to ENSO droughts vary from 1.4 to 89%—the higher ones being due to fire (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0200454.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). In natural forests, the effects may be limited because dead trees are rapidly replaced by regrowth and many forest systems are resilient to drought, unless they burn when it takes much longer for them to recover. In the case of crops including cocoa, tree mortality means at least three years without a cocoa crop–a serious loss of income for farmers. Crops often have low resilience to extreme climate events because they are often grown in sub-optimal regions where, for example, water could be limiting. This is the case for Barro Preto, where rainfall quantities and distribution pattern are almost at the limits for cocoa production.
