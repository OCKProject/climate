<p class="p">Recent ENSO-related drought has changed the balance of cocoa production between Brazilian states; Bahia used to produce 95% of Brazilian cocoa, but since the 1990’s, Bahian production has been declining mainly because of witches’ broom whereas production in Para state has been increasing considerably since it started in the 2000’s. In 2017 just after the drought, Para state became the most productive Brazilian state. The 2015–16 ENSO- drought reduced cocoa production in Bahia, which was already weakened by chronic fungal infection. Such changes in producing areas are common in cocoa and have been described as part of boom and bust cycles [

In the case of Brazil, these changes will result in a decrease in extensive traditional environmentally-friendly cocoa agroforestry systems with high species diversity (‘cabrucas’), which will be replaced by simplified systems with intensive inputs. These changes reflect a trend in world cocoa production to switch from shaded agroforests to intensively managed monocrops. However, diversified agroforestry systems remains the best strategy to increase small farmers’ resilience to severe climate events [
