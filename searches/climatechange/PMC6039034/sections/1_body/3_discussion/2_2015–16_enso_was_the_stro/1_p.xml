<p class="p">Despite large uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], severe ENSO events are expected to increase in frequency following climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Droughts are not unusual in Bahia and the probability of extreme droughts in Northern Brazil is one year in nine [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. We showed that recent ENSO was associated with the highest ONI values since the 1997–98 ENSO. It caused the strongest drought episode recorded for the last 15 years in Barro Preto, Bahia. At the global scale the ENSO 2015–16 is considered as the strongest event in the last 23 years with an SST anomaly of 0.3°C more than the highest anomaly recorded during strong 1997–98 ENSO [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Based on satellite data, northern Brazil and the Amazon were dramatically affected by the severe drought related to 2015–16 ENSO [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Northern Brazil had the maximum negative correlation between Vegetation health indices (VHI) and SST (−0.70) showing that vegetation was experiencing very high stress at large scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Thus, both natural vegetation and a major tree crop, cocoa, were affected by the same exceptional ENSO-related drought.
