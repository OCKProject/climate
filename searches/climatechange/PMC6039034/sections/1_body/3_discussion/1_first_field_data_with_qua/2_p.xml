<p class="p">In the only on-farm experiment on drought in Indonesia, plastic roofs were used over an eight-year cocoa plantation shaded by 
 <italic class="italic">Gliricidia</italic>, to create a 13-month artificial drought [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Most cocoa roots (&gt;83%) were found in the 40 upper cm of soil whereas 
 <italic class="italic">Gliricidia</italic> roots were found evenly distributed deeper into the soil (up to 250 cm depth). Water uptake for cocoa occurred in the first 30 upper cm of soil whereas water uptake for 
 <italic class="italic">Gliricidia</italic> occurred from depths &gt;30 cm [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. In the roof plots, the upper soil layers showed a rapid decrease in soil water content. Thus, near-surface cocoa roots were more exposed to drought than deeper 
 <italic class="italic">Gliricidia</italic> roots. The difference in the distribution of roots could explain the high mortality rate in cocoa trees and low mortality of other tree species in our experiment.
