<p class="p">Studies of the effect of previous ENSO events on cocoa plantations at regional scales in Asia, Africa and America were based on indirect data resulting from interviews and/or national statistical compilations of yield and planted area [

Our on-farm results confirm that cocoa is sensitive to very strong droughts, but the Brazilian yield data suggest that cocoa is not sensitive to mild droughts caused by weak, moderate or strong ENSO events; only ‘very strong’ ENSOs reduce yield but they do so very markedly.
