<p class="p">To our knowledge, our study on the effect of drought on cocoa agroforests, is the first, in South America, based on natural drought and field assessments on farms. Despite cocoa being known as a drought-sensitive crop [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] published, reliable, field-data on the effect of natural drought on mature plantations is scarce [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. There seems to be only one other on-farm study of the effect of 2015/16 ENSO drought on cocoa trees, done in Ghana [
 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>].The authors concluded that full-sun plantations were more resilient to drought than agroforests by comparing mortality, transpiration rates and soil water content in cocoa trees under only three specific shading regimes (full sun cocoa, cocoa-

 <italic class="italic">Antiaris toxicaria</italic>) in only one farm. The generality of this conclusion have been questioned by [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] who pointed out that 1) these two cocoa-shade tree associations were not representative of an agroforest and 2) the sub-optimal climate of the region (based on a single site) was not representative of climate conditions where cocoa is usually grown. Thus, our study is the first recording the effect of a natural severe drought on shaded cocoa in complex agroforestry systems based on data from several cocoa farms.
