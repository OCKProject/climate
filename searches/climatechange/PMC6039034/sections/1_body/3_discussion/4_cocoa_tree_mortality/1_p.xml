<p class="p">Cocoa tree mortality, 15%, was exceptionally high for reasonably healthy old cocoa plantations, where normal annual tree mortality is usually &lt;1% [

High tree losses during droughts are often caused by fire, but fire did not affect any cocoa plantations in Barro Preto during the study. However, 2,000 ha of cabrucas and forest burnt in the neighbouring municipalities as a result of the drought (reported in Intituto Arapyau:

Exceptionally high infection rates of pests and diseases can also be responsible for high tree mortality, for example a change from heavily shaded agroforests to non-shaded systems resulted in insect attack in São Tome and Fernando Pó in the 1920’s [
