<p class="p">Modern clones selected for their drought-tolerance characteristic were not found in our plots. However, we showed that clones not necessarily selected for the drought were more resistant than hybrids or traditional common amelonado. These clones include e.g CCN51, CCN10, PS1319 and TSH1188, accessions often selected for their high yield and disease resistance in high input and low-shade conditions, which could partially explain their drought tolerance. Numerous drought-tolerant cocoa accessions have been identified [

 <xref rid="pone.0200454.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. However most of the candidate clones have only been assessed in greenhouses or at very early stages of growth in plantations. There is an urgent need to assess these drought-tolerant clones in farm conditions and to introduce drought-tolerant clones in the Brazilian market of cocoa varieties. Recent ENSO-related droughts could result in ‘mass selection’ of the more drought-tolerant Amelonado at farm scale. As compared to most other crops, varietal selection by growers remains marginal in cocoa in Bahia (only 30% of the cocoa trees recorded were grafts or rooted cuttings selected as high-yielding disease-tolerant material); most cocoa found in Bahia is the semi-natural Amazonian Amelonado. A combination of ‘mass selection’ of local varieties and genetically selected drought-tolerant varieties will be necessary to limit the damage in future strong droughts.
