<p class="p">The National Ministry of Health of Morocco set up basic intervention strategies for the prevention and control of leishmaniases to reduce the incidence of cutaneous leishmaniasis to 50% by 2021 and to avoid mortality related to visceral leishmaniasis. To reach this goal, the interventions will primarily focus not only on the early screening of leishmaniases and case management, but also on strengthening the prevention and control actions within the framework of vector control. The vector control strategy should be reassessed and implemented in a framework of decision-making and quality assurance that can be applied at the lowest administrative system [

To face the consequences of climate change on insect-borne disease incidence and spread, emphasis should be placed on the inclusion of climate change risks and impacts in the national health strategy. The impact of climate change on insect-borne diseases, such as leishmaniases, is currently ongoing and requires stronger and earlier biological-based evidence. In Morocco, the lack of recent entomological data resulting from the long-term monitoring of sand fly diversity and density, as confirmed through sampling along some well-identified transects, is currently challenging. These data will help the future delineation of the altitudinal and latitudinal distribution of sand fly species that play an important role in 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> transmission. In addition to data on the diversity, data about the density and distribution of potential leishmania reservoirs are also lacking. These data are crucial to generating risk maps to define the spatial and temporal vulnerability, as well as the dispersion and colonization of vectors and reservoirs. Additionally, as recommended by Courtenay et al. (2017), a better understanding of the relationships between sand flies and mammalian hosts are needed to improve knowledge about transmission, the observed epidemiology of the disease, and their implications in the choice of control strategy [
