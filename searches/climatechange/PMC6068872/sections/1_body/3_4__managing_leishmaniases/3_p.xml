<p class="p">Therefore, effort should be given to selecting adequate indicators, in terms of time and space, to gather data with appropriate quality in terms of resolution, units, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. This will help define and establish an effective prevention strategy consistent with events previously defined (risk maps, monitoring, and health rules) and categorized by the region and period at risk. There are several examples (a) at a microscale: hygiene and animal management, (b) at a mesoscale: irrigation systems and oasis areas; and (c) at a macroscale: population migrations and droughts. Finally, it is necessary to develop and adopt an early warning system based on the integration of statistical/spatial prediction models using monthly or yearly climatic and disease outbreak data, density or activity for both vectors and reservoirs, and an appropriate field-based surveillance response, which will enhance surveillance.</p>
