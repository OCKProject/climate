<p class="p">The Fifth Assessment Report of the IPCC [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01542" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] indicates that warming of the global climate system is both unequivocal and evidenced by observations of increases in the global mean air and ocean temperatures, melting of ice, and rising of the average sea level. In the North African region, including Morocco, the IPCC models unanimously agree that general warming has demonstrably occurred [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01542" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Morocco is located between the arid zones of the Sahara and the moderate Mediterranean and Atlantic regions. According to the Second National Communication [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01542" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], future climate prediction may favor an expansion of the aridity to the north of the country. The analysis of temperature evolution between 1960 and 2000 highlights an increase of a maximum of 1.4 Â°C in the average temperature during this period, as well as an upward trend in both minimum and maximum temperatures. In Morocco, the predicted consequences are an increase in the overall temperature associated with a reduction in precipitation, leading to a northward expansion of arid climate characteristics [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-01542" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Morocco is considered a country vulnerable to the adverse impacts of global climatic change [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01542" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The main reasons raised are inadequate adaptive capacity for high water stress, socio-ecological and economic problems linked to food and water security, and uncontrolled migration.
