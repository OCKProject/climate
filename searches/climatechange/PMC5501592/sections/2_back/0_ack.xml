  <italic class="italic">Mathematical Biology Modeling Group</italic> at University of Northern Colorado made helpful comments and provided encouragement during various stages of this project. J. Champion developed a preliminary version of the Mathematica code to implement the Monte Carlo simulations. The Colorado Wildlife Conservation Grant program, administered cooperatively by Colorado Parks and Wildlife and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and Bureau of Land Management, were generous in supporting the field research described in this paper. The City of Boulder Open Space and Mountain Parks department also was generous in funding, support, and access to their properties. Several municipalities and private landowners were helpful in allowing access to their properties. M.A. Hayes was supported over several years by the University of Northern Colorado (UNC) School of Biological Sciences. Members of the UNC Chiropteran Research Laboratory, including J. Shaw, E. Snode, R. Carter, B. Bales, and K. Craven, provided insightful advice and field assistance. K. Navo and L. Bonewell provided information and expertise about use of abandoned mines by fringed myotis in Colorado, including in Boulder County. Tyree Designs provided a generous travel grant that helped offset travel expenses and facilitate field work. Three reviewers provided valuable feedback on earlier versions of the manuscript.
