<p class="p">We used what we believe to be plausible survival and fertility rates for forest bats in western North America, based on the literature and data from our study area [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Since we do not yet have capture-mark-recapture based estimates (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]) for vital rates over our full study area, we relied on estimates from the literature to parameterize our models. We defined mean annual survival rate for adults (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </sub>) as 0.79 following [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] for similar western forest species. For mean pup survival from birth to first birthday (
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 </sub>) we used 0.64 [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. To parameterize the mean fertility rate for a given age class (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>) we assumed that the age distribution at birth was equal (e.g., a 1:1 female:male birth ratio), that the mean litter size was 1.0, and that these values remained stable throughout all simulations. We assumed that the mean fertility rate for adult females (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </sub>) was 0.85 under stable conditions, and that the mean fertility rate for yearling females (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">0</italic>
 </sub>) was 90% of the adult fertility rate. The adult fertility rate of 0.85 is almost identical to the estimated mean fertility rate for 1996–2008 estimated for our study area by our logistic regression model for fertility using all available data from our study area (0.8496; see below). We treated birth as a discrete process that occurs on the last day of a given simulated year such that the proportion of females in a given age class that give birth is a function of the probability of surviving the year and the probability of being reproductively active that year (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>*
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">i</italic>
 </sub>). We counted the number of individuals in each age class on the first day of each simulated year. Given these assumptions, the expected values (E) of female offspring (
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>) produced per reproductive female are: E[
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </sub>] = (0.5)(0.85) = 0.425 and E[
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">Y</italic>
 </sub>] = (0.50)(0.85)(0.90) = 0.3825. These vital rates are similar to those reported by O'Shea et al. ([
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]; a 3-class model) for big brown bats (
 <italic class="italic">Eptesicus fuscus</italic>) in maternity roosts associated with buildings and forests in and near Fort Collins, Colorado, and are similar in structure to the generalized model of Indiana bats (
 <italic class="italic">Myotis sodalis</italic>) use by Hallam and Federico ([
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]; a 15-class model). The vital rates we used were intended to be both plausible and result in an approximately stable 4-stage matrix model when analyzed analytically and when projected through an approximately stable Monte Carlo simulation (see below). In all simulations, we used an initial population of 2,000 females as follows: 600 pups; 290 1-year-old females; 230 2-year-old females; and 880 3-year-and-older females. We followed the approach of previous researchers in only considering females, given that stable female populations are critical to maintaining stable populations of sensitive species [
