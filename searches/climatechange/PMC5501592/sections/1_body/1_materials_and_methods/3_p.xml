<p class="p">This age-structured population model for fringed myotis was designed to result in an approximately stable initial age distribution and an asymptotic population growth rate of λ ≈ 1.0. We do not currently know if fringed myotis populations are stable, growing, or decreasing, but for the purposes of this analysis we assume that the simulated fringed myotis populations were stable during the recent past (e.g., 1950–2000). The initial age distribution was close to a stable age-distribution of approximately two thousand females. The dominant eigenvalue (λ) and eigenvectors (

 </bold>) were calculated to determine the population growth rate and stable age distributions of the population. We assumed that female bats gave birth to either 1 or 0 pups per year, and therefore fertility rates were constrained between 0 and 1 and expressed as females born per year per adult female. It is possible that forest-dwelling

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], but for this analysis we assumed that only single pups were born, survived parturition, and become successfully volant. In this situation, all vital rates are constrained between 0 and 1. We conducted sensitivity analysis for the matrix elements [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] by individually varying estimated fertility and survival rates by minus ten percent (-10%; e.g. rate × 0.90), while keeping other vital rates at their original value. This sensitivity analysis describes the relative effects of changes in fertility and survival rates on the population growth rate (λ). We then evaluated elasticity, which estimates the effects of proportional changes in vital rates on λ. Elasticity of a given matrix element (
