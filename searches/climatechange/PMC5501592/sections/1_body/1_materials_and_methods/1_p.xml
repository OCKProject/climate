<p class="p">We used population models to simulate and analyze the potential relationships between a changing climate and the population dynamics of fringed myotis (
 <italic class="italic">Myotis thysanodes</italic>) populations living in forested landscapes of Colorado’s Front Range and elsewhere in western North America. We explored the dynamics of simulated populations through year 2086 following standard procedures for developing deterministic and stochastic age structured population dynamics models [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], and by incorporating into these models the changes in climate projected by global circulation models under varying carbon emission scenarios downscaled to the approximate location of our study area in the Southern Rocky Mountains (Boulder County, Colorado; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0180693.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). In this section we describe: how we built our age-structured population dynamics model, including how we parameterized vital rates; how we evaluated the sensitivity and elasticity of this model; how stochasticity was added to the model; how we developed a statistical model to predict female reproductive rates in future years using future climate projections; how we performed Monte Carlo simulations under various future climate projections; and finally the software used to perform the analysis.
