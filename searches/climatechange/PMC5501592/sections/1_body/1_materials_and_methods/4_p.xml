<p class="p">We added demographic stochasticity to all models for each age class, year, vital rate, and simulation run by incorporating a pseudo-random number generator into vital rates using a triangular probability density function. This function randomly selected a vital rate between the minimum and maximum specified vital rate, with the peak of the distribution positioned at the median vital rate. Using a triangular distribution produces relatively heavy tails but keeps the vital rates constrained between the minimum and maximum values. We also introduced environmental stochasticity into fertility rate estimates. For our Boulder County study area (Boulder Models), we used the minimum and maximum fertility rates predicted using a logistic regression model (see below) and minimum and maximum temperature and precipitation projections for a given future year. We developed range-wide fringed myotis models (General Models), using information from occurrence location records for fringed myotis available in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility database (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0180693.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We drew adult fertility rates from a triangular distribution with minimum and maximum of 0.90 and 1.10 multiplied by the prediction for each age class. Thus, if predicted fertility for a given year and age class is high, the mean number of simulated offspring produced by the age class could exceed 1.0. This environmental stochasticity was used in Monte Carlo simulations in the same way as above for demographic stochasticity, by incorporating a pseudo-random number generator into fertility rates using a triangular probability density function. This function randomly selected a fertility rate between the minimum and maximum predicted for a given year and age class, with the peak of the distribution positioned at the median fertility rate.
