<p class="p">Long-term field studies suggest that in some parts of western North America the proportion of reproductively active females tends to be lower during hotter and drier years, during which historically-used maternity roost sites may be substantially warmer and the availability of surface water is reduced [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] evaluated reproductive condition in female insectivorous bats using 13 years of data (1996–2008) from the Colorado Front Range, and found that reproductive success was lowest in years that were hotter and drier. For example, in 2007 and 2008—two of the driest years of the study—less than 60% of fringed myotis females and less than 50% of little brown bat (
 <italic class="italic">Myotis lucifugus</italic>) females of reproductive age were determined to be reproductively active. Such a high proportion of non-reproductive females is in stark contrast to other parts of North America that are not arid. In New Hampshire during a similar period (1993–2008), Frick et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] estimated that on average 95% of adult female little brown bats were reproductively active, with the lowest rate of 87% during 2008. The substantially lower reproductive rates during drier years observed in western North America may be the result of behavioral and physiological adaptations to arid ecoregions. Adams [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] proposed that during periods of heat and water stress non-reproductive females and reproductive females that abandon young are released from being anchored to maternity roosts that increase evaporative water loss, or that are near water resources but suboptimal for non-reproductive female roosting. Thus, during the hottest and driest years when roosts may be hottest and water resources may be farther from suitable maternity roosts—and regularly visiting these water resources requires additional energy and adds to water stress—a substantial proportion of females may not produce viable offspring that survive to adulthood. In arid regions, this strategy may have positive influences on individual survival rates and thus improve reproductive output over a female’s remaining reproductive years. However, pronounced and prolonged decreases in the proportion of females that produce viable offspring over years and decades may put some populations at risk of extinction [
