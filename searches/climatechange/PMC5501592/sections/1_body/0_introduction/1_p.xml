 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], in part because bats represent a large contribution to mammalian species diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Climate change projections for North America suggest that future conditions will be warmer and drier in some parts of western North America, including ecoregions that are currently arid [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These projections also suggest that previously aberrant weather and hydrologic patterns, such as longer and more intense droughts and substantially prolonged reductions in surface water and stream-flows, will be more frequent [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. The temperate zone insectivorous bat populations that occur in western North America may be impacted by these changes. These species tend to be long-lived (e.g., &gt;5 years)[
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], but reproduce at most once per year, and usually produce only one viable offspring per reproductive year [
