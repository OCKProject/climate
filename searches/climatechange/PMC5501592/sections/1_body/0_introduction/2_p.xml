<p class="p">During the reproductive season many bat species in western North America establish maternity roosts where congregations of reproductive females give birth to and raise young [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. As a result, reproductive females often establish maternity roosts close to predictable water resources and visit these water resources more frequently than do non-reproductive females. For example, Adams and Hayes [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] showed that reproductive female fringed myotis (
 <italic class="italic">Myotis thysanodes</italic>) visited an artificial water source near a maternity roost much more frequently than did non-reproductive females of the same species. These behavior patterns underscore the notion that pregnant and lactating females require more frequent access to surface water resources than do females that are not reproductively active.
