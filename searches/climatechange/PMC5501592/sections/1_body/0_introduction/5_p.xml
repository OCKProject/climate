<p class="p">We used age-structured, stochastic population dynamics models and simulations to explore the dynamics of hypothetical bat populations through the later portion of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (the 2080’s), and incorporated into these population models the potential impacts of a changing climate on female reproductive success [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], based on downscaled global circulation models. We developed an age-structured population model for fringed myotis that incorporated plausible survival and fertility rates and that resulted in an approximately stable age distribution and a population growth rate (λ) of λ ≈ 1.0. We then explored the potential influence of a changing climate on fringed myotis populations in our study area, as well as generalized fringed myotis populations in western North America, using Monte Carlo simulations [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. We view these fringed myotis simulations as “first approximation models” [
