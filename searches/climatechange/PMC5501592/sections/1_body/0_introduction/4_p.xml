<p class="p">Population dynamics models have been used to evaluate the potential impacts of a changing climate on species of management and conservation concern. For example, population dynamics models have been used to evaluate the impacts of increasing sea surface temperatures on North Sea cod populations [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] could have substantial impacts on the bat populations in our study area, and that these impacts could over decades substantially erode bat populations if the climate becomes warmer and drier. However, the magnitude of the impacts of a changing climate on bat populations in our study area and elsewhere in western North America was not clear to us. The objective of this study was to use numerical simulations to analyze the potential relationships between a changing climate and the dynamics of bat populations living in western North America. Here, we focus on fringed myotis, which is a species of substantial conservation concern in the United States and may be particularly susceptible to a warmer, drier climate in western North America [

This study is part of a broader research program investigating the impacts of changing climate conditions on bat behavior and populations in the Southern Rocky Mountains, and elsewhere in western North America. A key goal of this program is to combine field experiments, collection and analysis of long-term datasets, and mathematical simulations to better understand potential impacts of a changing climate on bat populations in our study area, and develop insights into the potential impacts of a changing climate on bat populations in other parts of western North America.
