<p class="p">In this analysis fringed myotis populations increased or remained stable in 4 simulations for our Boulder study area (RCP2.6 Ensemble, RCP2.6 NCAR, RCP4.5 NCAR, RCP6.0 NCAR models), and decreased substantially in 4 of the simulations (RCP 4.5 Ensemble, RCP 6.0 Ensemble, RCP 8.5 Ensemble, and RCP 8.5 NCAR models). All of the range-wide General Models eroded substantially over the 77 year simulations, with all representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, RCP8.5) resulting in &gt;90% reduction in simulated fringed myotis populations (

This result suggests that fringed myotis populations in some parts of western North America have the potential to be substantially impacted by a changing climate. Our results suggest that fringed myotis populations may be particularly susceptible to the impacts of a changing climate in the southwestern U.S. (e.g., Arizona and New Mexico) and in northern MÃ©xico (

These results also support the hypothesis that a changing climate in western North America has the potential, by gradually eroding some populations, to radically change the geographic distributions of some bat species, reorder patterns of species richness and diversity, and alter the ecosystem services provided by bats. It is possible that fringed myotis and other forest bat populations might adapt to changing climate conditions either through behavioral adaptations (such as moving to more suitable locations and/or selecting different roosting sites) or via phenotypic plasticity. Investigation of behavioral and/or phenotypic adaptations to a changing climate could be fruitful directions for future research. However, our results suggest that even relatively small, but persistent, reductions in fertility rates can result in eroding populations. Sensitivity and elasticity results suggest that conservation strategies aimed at improving and maintaining fertility rates, as well as those aimed at supporting survival rates, might be best directed at mature females, such as those three years and older (
