<p class="p">Future research and population modeling efforts related to bat populations in the Southern Rocky Mountains, and elsewhere in western North America, would benefit from more research in three key areas. First, there is a lack of long-term capture and mark-recapture data related to 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis</italic> species in the Southern Rocky Mountains, and elsewhere in western North America. Collecting high quality mark-recapture data, for example, and developing estimates of species-specific survival and fertility rates under various environmental conditions and in different ecoregions would improve substantially on the modeling effort presented here. The multi-year mark-recapture data and analysis related to big brown bats (

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], provides a framework for developing vital rate estimates in natural 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis</italic> populations. A multi-decade project similar to the Fort Collins bat project, but conducted in a forested area, would greatly improve our knowledge of how 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis</italic> populations respond to varying climate and surface water conditions in the Southern Rocky Mountains.
