<p class="p">The impacts of a changing climate in North America are projected to result in warmer and drier conditions in the southwestern U.S. where most future climate models project increasing annual mean temperatures and decreasing annual precipitation [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The southwestern U.S. is projected to become substantially drier, while northern portions of the continent are projected to become wetter, with Colorado in an area between these regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Generally southern Colorado is projected to become drier than northern Colorado, with Boulder County, which is in the northern half of Colorado, currently being projected to become substantially warmer, potentially without a substantial change in mean annual precipitation. The modeling approach employed here of coupling local climate change projections with a statistical model of female fertility rates and bat population dynamics simulations may be useful in analyzing the impacts of regional climate and ecological change on species of conservation concern in other ecoregions. This approach may also be useful in helping to prioritize bat species for limited conservation and management resources. For example, our results suggest that fringed myotis populations in the southwestern U.S. (e.g., New Mexico and Arizona) and in northern México may be at relatively more risk from the influences of a changing climate than populations in more northern parts of this species distribution (e.g., the Pacific Northwest, Wyoming, and South Dakota) (

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. In our study area, fringed myotis and other forest bat species often use ephemeral water resources for drinking water after emerging from day roosts and during nightly foraging bouts, and maternity roost sites appear to be anchored to predictable and high quality resources [

 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. These water resources (e.g., small streams and pools) often fill in the spring when stream flows are highest, then dry later in the summer. Our observations are that during years with more precipitation these small ephemeral water resources tend to be more abundant and last longer than in drier years. Developing an improved understanding of how bats use the water resources available to them during wet and dry years would lead to a better understanding of how a changing climate might impact different forest-dwelling species.
