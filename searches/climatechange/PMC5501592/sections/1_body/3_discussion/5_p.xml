<p class="p">A third area of research that would improve our knowledge of forest bat populations in the Southern Rocky Mountains and elsewhere in western North America would be the continuation and development of additional long-term research projects similar to the forest bat monitoring project described by Adams [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] in the Boulder County Front Range. Turchin [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] has emphasized that multi-decade empirical time series data is needed to analyze the population dynamics of terrestrial animal populations. Such long-term capture and monitoring data, along with field experiments [e.g.,
