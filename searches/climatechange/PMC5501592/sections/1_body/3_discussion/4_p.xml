<p class="p">A second area of research that would improve on the modeling presented here would be to develop capture probability estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis</italic> species related to reproductive status. Adams and Hayes [
 <xref rid="pone.0180693.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] found that reproductive female fringed myotis visited a water resource near a maternity roost significantly more often than non-reproductive females, and presumably more frequently than males, of the same species. This suggests that, because reproductive females visit water resources more frequently than non-reproductive females and males, reproductive females may be more likely than non-reproductive females to be captured in mist nets set at water resources, and thus fertility estimates based on mist-net capture rates that we used in this analysis may be higher than exhibited by the natural population. Robust capture-mark-recapture studies as described above, in addition to estimating vital rates, could be used to help understand variation in capture probabilities among sex, age, and reproductive classes.
