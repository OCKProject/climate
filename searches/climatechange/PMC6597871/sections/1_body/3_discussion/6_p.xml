<p class="p">Isolation by landscape resistance explained range‐wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by geographic distance alone. For instance, temperature fluctuations were found to be the most important factor explaining relatedness patterns in

Our IBR results hold when accounting for spatial dependence and when excluding different numbers of samples, although forest cover looses importance when more samples are excluded (Supporting Information Figure

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), suggesting that the resolution of these microsatellite‐based studies only allowed the detection of very strong IBR effects. Our findings thus imply that fine‐scale genetic structure and IBR may be more common in this group of bees than previously acknowledged and that studies employing thousands of genetic markers and large sample sizes are needed to identify or rule out weak, but significant IBR effects.
