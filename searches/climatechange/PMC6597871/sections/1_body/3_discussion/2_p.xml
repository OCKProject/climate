<p class="p">Our study reveals a clinal change in genetic structure across the distribution range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic>, with four identifiable genetic clusters. Genetic diversity was not influenced by habitat amount, pairwise relatedness showed spatial autocorrelation, and isolation by resistance explained range‐wide relatedness patterns better than isolation by geographic distance. Specifically, gene flow was enhanced by low annual temperature variation, more forest cover, lower elevations, and flatter terrains. Finally, we detected genomic signatures of adaptation to temperature, precipitation, and forest cover and found latitudinal and altitudinal patterns in the spatial distribution of adaptive genetic variation.
