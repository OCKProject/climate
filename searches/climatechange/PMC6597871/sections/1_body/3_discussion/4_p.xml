<p class="p">Genetic diversity was slightly higher than that reported in other genomic bee studies (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Romiguier et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and in all genetic clusters we found Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values overlapping with zero, which indicate mutation–drift equilibrium. Additionally, we did not find a significant association between habitat amount and genetic diversity. These results suggest that genetic variation has not been influenced by habitat loss yet and that the observed levels of inbreeding are presumably related to the reproductive biology of this species (DiLeo &amp; Wagner, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Monogamy (Jaffé et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), low population densities, and sharp seasonal variations in the production of reproductive individuals (Ferreira, Blochtein, &amp; Serrão, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Roubik, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Santos‐Filho, Alves, Eterovic, Imperatriz‐fonseca, &amp; Kleinert, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) may result in mating between related individuals. We nevertheless caution that longer time lags may be necessary to detect an effect of habitat loss on genetic diversity (Schlaepfer, Braschler, Rusterholz, &amp; Baur, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>).
