<p class="p">Even though thermal stability was the main factor explaining gene flow patterns in 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic>, temperature annual range and forest cover were highly correlated, so we could not disentangle the relative contribution of each. Our work is nevertheless the first to reveal a significant effect of forest cover on stingless bee gene flow, a long‐standing expectation for this group of bees with restricted dispersal (Jaffé, Pope, et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Reduced gene flow across deforested areas was only found in one other tropical organism so far (Monteiro et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>), namely the army ant

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Interestingly, these army ants exhibit striking life history similarities with stingless bees, as queens are permanently wingless and thus show a restricted dispersal (Jaffé, Moritz, &amp; Kraus, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Forested areas thus seem important dispersal corridors for this stingless bee, which could facilitate the migration toward higher elevations predicted under climate change (Supporting Information Figure
