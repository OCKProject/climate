<p class="p">We detected significant spatial autocorrelation in genetic relatedness, contradicting earlier microsatellite‐based studies for other stingless bee species (Jaffé, Castilla, et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Landaverde‐González et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Interestingly, spatial autocorrelation was positive for up to 300 km (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), indicating that related colonies can be found across large areas and that gene flow did not erase the genetic signals left by limited colony dispersal. Above 300 km, spatial autocorrelation became negative, suggesting that population differentiation caused lower than random relatedness between individuals from different clusters (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). These results suggest it would be safe to transport colonies no further than 300 km to avoid altering the genetic composition of wild populations (Jaffé, Pope, et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
