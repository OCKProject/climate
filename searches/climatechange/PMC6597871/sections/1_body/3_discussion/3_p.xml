 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we here present the first assessment of spatial genetic structure based on thousands of independent genetic markers and performed across the full distribution range of this species. Our results reveal four genetic clusters, confirmed by two complementary methods, and extensive admixture (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Genetic clusters located at the northernmost and southernmost extremes of the species’ distribution range (Pop 1 and Pop 4) showed lower nucleotide diversity and lower effective population size (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">e</sub>) but similar heterozygosity and inbreeding as the genetic clusters located at the distribution's core (Pop 2 and Pop 3). This finding suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic> colonized these peripheral regions more recently, whereas clusters Pop 2 and Pop 3 had more time to accumulate a higher genetic variability, as stated by the central–peripheral hypothesis (Diniz‐Filho et al.,
