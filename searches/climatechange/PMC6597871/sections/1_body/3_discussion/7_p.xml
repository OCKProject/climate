<p class="p">Our results reveal that thermal stability and forest cover (which were highly correlated) are key mediators of genetic connectivity in this stingless bee species, and support earlier findings stressing out the role of elevation as a bee dispersal barrier (Jackson et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Jaffé, Pope, et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Although thermal range is known to have a profound influence on insect physiology (Dixon et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), ours is the first study to report an effect on dispersal behaviors. Interestingly, temperature annual range was found to be the main abiotic predictor of bee richness and diversity in the eastern Neotropics, suggesting environmental variability may have led to higher speciation (Faria &amp; Gonçalves, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our results imply that a similar mechanism may be operating at the species level, with increased thermal variability hindering gene flow, and thus facilitating local adaptation (Allendorf et al.,
