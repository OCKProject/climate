<p class="p">Taken together, our findings shed important light on the life history of 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic> and highlight the role of regions with large thermal fluctuations, deforested areas, and mountain ranges as dispersal barriers. Moreover, our work unravels previously unknown patterns of local adaptation in these bees. This knowledge could help guide future conservation actions such as avoiding the transportation of colonies beyond 300 km, preserving highland and lowland populations separately, and conserving or restoring foothill and mountain forests. Considering the high biological and economic importance of this native pollinator, such conservation efforts will be easily offset if honey production and pollination services are maintained in the future.
