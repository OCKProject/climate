Cluster assignments were generally unambiguous as ancestry coefficients for the assigned clusters were usually above 0.50 (lower 25% quantile = 0.50, median = 0.60, upper 75% quantile = 0.86). Clusters 1 and 4, located at the northern and southern extremes of the species distribution range, showed the lowest
