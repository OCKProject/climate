<p class="p">Habitat amount was not found associated with heterozygosity or inbreeding (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). We found positive spatial autocorrelation in pairwise genetic relatedness for up to 300 km, after which spatial autocorrelation became negative (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, IBR was better able to explain genetic relatedness patterns than IBD (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Temperature annual range (defined as the difference between maximum temperature of warmest month and minimum temperature of coldest month) was the best predictor of relatedness patterns across the full distribution range of

 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), suggesting that forest cover, altitude, and terrain roughness combined did not explain relatedness patterns as well as temperature fluctuations alone. All these predictors showed a significantly negative association with genetic relatedness (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Although temperature annual range did not show a larger variation than the other predictors used to assess IBR (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>), it was highly correlated with forest cover (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.94; Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>), so the effect of temperature annual range is likely confounded by forest cover to some extent. Nested MLPE models (accounting for spatial dependence) substantially improved fit and reduced evident autocorrelation. Although parameter estimates from NMLPE models had slightly larger standard errors (implying these were more conservative estimates), all effects continued to be significantly different from zero (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0004" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Our sensitivity analysis on IBR models revealed that temperature annual range, altitude, and terrain roughness were the most frequent variables included in the set of best models (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>).
