<p class="p">About 10% of all analyzed sequences contained signatures of selection (Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-tbl-0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>), and most of the identified candidate loci were associated with temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The spatial distribution of adaptive genetic variability revealed latitudinal and altitudinal gradients (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
