<p class="p">To assess IBR, we fit mixed‐effects regression models using penalized least squares and a novel correlation structure designed to account for the nonindependence of pairwise distances across individuals and spatial locations (based on the maximum‐likelihood population effects or MLPE model:

 <xref rid="eva12794-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), there exists a spatial dependence structure in pairwise comparisons between individuals that is not captured by the MLPE model. This is because the MLPE correlation structure only models dependence across pairwise comparisons that overlap in the individuals being compared, with no reference to spatial location. The unmodeled spatial dependence has the net effect of making inference anticonservative and can be diagnosed by calculating serial autocorrelation in the normalized residuals of the MLPE model, after sorting the data by spatial locations. To combat this, we introduce a novel modification of the MLPE model that incorporates correlation between pairwise measurements due to comparison of both individuals and spatial locations (Nested MLPE or NMLPE). Briefly, the original MLPE model has a random‐effects representation where the expected value for each pairwise observation includes a pair of iid random effects (one for each of the individuals being compared in the observation), whereas our extension (NMLPE) additionally incorporates iid random effects for pairs of spatial locations (see Supporting Information Script
