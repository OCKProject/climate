<p class="p">Aiming to assess the influence of habitat amount on genetic diversity, we reclassified a high‐resolution land cover/land use map for 2013 (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mapbiomas.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://mapbiomas.org/</ext-link>) into habitat (i.e., all types of natural forest and nonforest formations) and nonhabitat (farming, nonvegetated areas, and water bodies). The percentage of habitat cover in 2‐km‐radius buffers surrounding our sampling locations was then calculated, as such radius comprises the estimated foraging distance for this species (Silva &amp; Ramalho, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Because more than one colony was sampled in some locations (Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="eva12794-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), we computed mean percentage of habitat cover and mean genetic diversity (

 <sub class="sub">O</sub>, 
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">E</sub>, and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>) for each location (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 56 locations). We then used the 
 <italic class="italic">nlme</italic> package (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, &amp; Sarkar, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) to fit generalized least squares models (gls) containing genetic diversity metrics as response variables, percentage of habitat cover as predictor, and different correlation structures (no autocorrelation, linear, exponential, Gaussian, spherical, and rational quadratics) to account for spatial autocorrelation. Logit transformations were used to normalize/linearize heterozygosities. The sample‐size‐corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) was then used to compare models with different correlation structures, fitted with restricted maximum likelihood. The best models (∆AICc ≤ 2) were finally selected, fitted once more using maximum likelihood, and compared to reduced models without predictor variables using likelihood ratio tests (LRT, 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = 0.05). All models were validated by plotting residual versus fitted values and by checking for residual autocorrelation.
