<p class="p">Yang's relatedness between pairs of individuals was used as response variable and the different resistance distances (geographic distance, forest cover, elevation, roughness, temperature annual range, mean temperature of coldest quarter, and precipitation of driest quarter) as predictors in our MLPE models. We used the Akaike information criterion (AIC) to compare models containing all possible combinations of noncollinear predictors (

Likelihood ratio tests were then performed to assess the influence of the inclusion of each predictor variable on the best‐fitting model's log‐likelihood. Finally, we refitted the best models using NMLPE models to obtain parameter estimates unbiased by spatial dependence. To evaluate the impact of excluding samples from our IBR analyses, we also ran a sensitivity analysis, generating one hundred data subsets (randomly excluding different numbers of samples) and performing one hundred independent model selection protocols for each subset (using MLPE models). We report the number of times predictor variables were included in the set of best‐fitting MLPE regression models (∆AIC ≤ 2), after randomly excluding different numbers of samples (Supporting Information Figure
