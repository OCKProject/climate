<p class="p">We then calculated genetic diversity metrics for each one of the identified genetic clusters. These included observed heterozygosity (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">O</sub>), expected heterozygosity (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">E</sub>), nucleotide diversity (
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>), and inbreeding coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>; see VCFtools manual for details). Effective population size (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">e</sub>) was also estimated employing the linkage disequilibrium method implemented in NeEstimator 2.0.1 (Do et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), using a threshold lowest allele frequency value of 0.05 and assuming a monogamy model (Jaffé et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additionally, we calculated Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>, representing the difference between the mean number of pairwise differences and the number of segregating sites. In a population of constant size evolving under mutation–drift equilibrium, Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> is expected to be zero; negative values result from an excess of rare alleles and thus indicate a recent selective sweep or a population expansion after a recent bottleneck; and positive values appear when rare alleles are lacking, therefore suggesting balancing selection or a sudden population contraction (Tajima, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). We used 
 <italic class="italic">r2vcftools</italic> to compute a genome‐wide estimate of Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> and perform a simulation from the neutral model to correct for bias due to a minor‐allele‐frequency filter.
