<p class="p">Two complementary genetic clustering software packages were employed to assess population structure using the resulting set of neutral and independent loci: the

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and Admixture (Alexander, Novembre, &amp; Lange, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The number ancestral populations (
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>) was allowed to vary between 1 and 10, with 10 replicate runs for each 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>‐value, and the best 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> was chosen based on cross‐entropy and cross‐validation errors (Frichot et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Individuals were then assigned to genetic clusters based on the ancestry coefficients retrieved from LEA (Q‐matrix), identifying the cluster with the highest ancestry.
