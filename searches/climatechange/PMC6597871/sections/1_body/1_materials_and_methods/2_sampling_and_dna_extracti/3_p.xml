<p class="p">Total genomic DNA was extracted from the whole insects (discarding only the heads) using Qiagen's DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit, according to the manufacturer's protocols. DNA integrity was then verified on 1% agarose gels, and its concentration was quantified with a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Only samples containing nondegraded DNA, concentrations of at least 20 ng/μl, and a total DNA amount greater than 2 μg were used for subsequent RAD sequencing.</p>
