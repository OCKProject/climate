<p class="p">We collected samples of 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic> across its entire distribution range (Pedro, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), aiming to maximize temperature, precipitation, elevation, and forest cover gradients (Figure 
 <xref rid="eva12794-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Samples were collected between 2013 and 2014 (SISBIO collection permits 38000‐1 and 10393‐1). We sampled one bee per colony from a total of 160 nests of beekeepers who could certify their local origin. We only collected samples from local colonies, and not from colonies of unknown origin or from nests brought from different locations. We also registered any information on previous introductions of bee colonies that beekeepers could provide, as long‐distance colony transportation is common and has been shown to have profound effects on stingless bee gene flow (Jaffé, Pope, et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In cases when beekeepers had a few weak colonies, we did not collect any samples or collected samples from a single colony. When beekeepers had many strong colonies, we collected samples from more than one colony. Distance separating sampling locations therefore ranged between 0 km (samples from the same beekeeper) and 947 km. Only freshly emerged (callow) workers were collected from the nest's interior, to minimize the sampling of drifters. All individuals were stored in absolute ethanol and then frozen at −20°C until DNA extractions. The geographic location of all samples was recorded by GPS (see Supporting Information Table
