<p class="p">Here, we employ novel landscape genomic tools to assess the joint influence of habitat degradation and climate change on an economically important tropical stingless bee inhabiting one of the most deforested, driest, and hottest regions of the Americas. Distributed across northeastern Brazil, 
 <italic class="italic">Melipona subnitida</italic> Ducke, 1911 (known as the Jandaíra bee) is a key pollinator of native plants and local crops and one of the most widely used stingless bee species for honey production (Imperatriz‐Fonseca, Koedam, &amp; Hrncir, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), contributing to the household income of many rural families (Giannini et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Jaffé et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The species natural range spans four different biomes (Giannini et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Imperatriz‐Fonseca et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), namely Tropical Dry Forest (Caatinga), Savanna (Cerrado), the Atlantic Rain Forest, and Mangrove Forests, thus encompassing important climatic and altitudinal gradients, which are expected to drive local adaptations (Koffler et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Maia‐Silva, Hrncir, Silva, &amp; Imperatriz‐Fonseca, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Species distribution models suggest the species could respond to climate change by seeking refuge in higher elevations, where both the bees and their plant resources are more likely to find suitable climatic conditions in the future (Giannini et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, such response depends on the bee's ability to relocate to high‐quality habitats, which could be hindered by the region's increasing human‐led desertification (Marengo, Torres, &amp; Alves, 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Vieira et al., 
 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Given 
 <italic class="italic">M. subnitida</italic>'s key biological and economic importance, efforts are urgently needed to safeguard this key pollinator by facilitating its migration toward higher lands. Such conservation actions will nevertheless require the prior identification of barriers to gene flow and the spatial distribution of adaptive genetic variation.
