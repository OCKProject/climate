<p class="p">Dispersal is believed to be particularly restricted in stingless bees (Apidae: Meliponini), because daughter colonies rely on resources from their maternal colonies during their initial establishment and consequently do not establish far from each other (Roubik,

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). As restricted dispersal implies a diminished ability to move to high‐quality habitats and maintain gene flow across fragmented landscapes, habitat loss and fragmentation are expected to reduce and isolate stingless bee populations, making them extremely susceptible to genetic erosion through the action of genetic drift (Allendorf, Luikart, &amp; Aitken,

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, previous studies using microsatellite markers were not able to detect an effect of forest or land cover on stingless bee gene flow, suggesting that these bees have a remarkable ability to maintain high gene flow across heterogeneous and human‐altered landscapes (Jaffé, Castilla, et al.,

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Since estimates of genetic diversity and gene flow are strongly influenced by the type and number of genetic markers employed (Allendorf,

 <xref rid="eva12794-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), genomic studies employing thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are needed to confirm whether stingless bees are really resilient to habitat loss and fragmentation, or whether the lack of significant isolation‐by‐resistance effects in previous studies is due to the resolution of the genetic markers employed (Alvarado‐Serrano, Van Etten, Chang, &amp; Baucom,
