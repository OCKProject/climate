  <title class="title">Summary of the modeled global distribution of 
   <italic class="italic">Culex quinquefasciatus</italic> under both current and future climatic conditions to show the stability of predictions at present and into the future, and to illustrate differences among representative concentration pathways (RCPs).

  <p class="p">Dark blue represents model stability under both current and future conditions, dark red represents agreement among all climate models in anticipating potential distributional areas in the future, and light red indicates low agreement between diverse climate models as regards distributional potential in the future.</p>
