<p class="p">The global distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> presents a risk for introduction and transmission of WNV in novel areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], such as Brazil, Peru, Australia, and New Zealand. Possible expansion of the range of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> may place still more countries at risk of exposure: for example, higher summer temperatures have been identified as a key factor associated with WNV expansion in British Columbia in Canada [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. WNV outbreaks in Europe have been nonrecurring and localized; however, they have been enzootic and widespread in USA [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. This pattern of disease spread may be a reflection to the distributional pattern of key vector populations or may reflect the recency of its establishment in North America.
