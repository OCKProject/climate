<p class="p">This study assembled a global data set summarizing occurrences of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic>, and provided detailed maps of its potential geographic distribution under current and future climatic conditions. The latter objective is important to anticipating any possible future distributional changes of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic>. These maps (1) give a detailed picture of the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic>, which is a potential vector for several arboviruses and lymphatic filariasis; (2) anticipate possible changes in the range of the species under future conditions; (3) identify areas of risk where diseases transmitted by this vector can be established with availability of infection sources through human dynamics; and (4) identify countries with priorities for 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> surveillance programs where data are unavailable (e.g., Western Europe). The predicted distribution of the species was focused in southern regions of the world, both under present-day and future conditions.
