<p class="p">The potential distributional area of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> increased from present-day conditions to RCP 6.0, and then decreased in RCP 8.5. Area increased by 4.9% from present-day conditions to RCP 6.0 then decreased by 1.3% from RCP 6.0 to RCP 8.5 (details for each GCM are presented in supporting information 2). Detailed maps of

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163863.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) illustrate differences among RCPs. Highest stability of the models among present-day and future conditions appeared in the belt between 30°S and 30°N, which includes much of South America, central and southern Africa, South and East Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The same pattern of suitability was also observed in a narrow zone in Western Europe and the southern United States. Areas presenting full agreement among all future climate models in anticipating distributional potential in the future include only Kangaroo Island (Australia), Somalia, and Colombia. Areas showing low agreement (= high uncertainty) among climate models as regards distributional potential in the future included North and Central Africa, Afghanistan, Pakistan, the central United States, and southeastern Europe. Interactive maps for present-day and future distribution of
