<p class="p">The integrated maps of current and future distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> can guide better applications of vector surveillance and disease control programs across the world. The distributional maps of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> can be also useful to the Global Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme (GLFEP), which considers control of 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> as an important element in control efforts in most endemic countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. These maps are also key elements in recent events in which arboviruses have emerged worldwide. This study can guide control programs and surveillance priorities, which are primarily dependent on identification of suitable areas where the vector occurs or may occur. Finally, it is important to highlight that if 
 <italic class="italic">Cx</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic> is proven to be functioning as a ZIKV vector, the disease control strategies will change dramatically, since most affected countries have no control program targeting this species. In this case, these maps will form a baseline by which to anticipate areas at ZIKV risk and will help in response to the disease outbreak.
