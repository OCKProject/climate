 <italic class="italic">quinquefasciatus</italic>, we selected parallel data sets for four representative concentration pathways (RCPs; RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5) accounting for different future emission scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) available in WorldClim archive. For each RCP, we included 11 GCMs for which data for all RCPs were available, for a total of 44 combinations (

Bioclimatic variables 8–9 and 18–19 were omitted from analysis, in light of known spatial artifacts in those variables. The remaining of 15 variables were submitted to a principle components analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality and avoid multicollinearity between variables [
