 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. The Grinnellian niche is characterized as the set of environmental conditions needed by the species to maintain populations without immigrational subsidy [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The models were calibrated based on the first six principal components from the PCA analysis described above, and then transferred to our 44 views of potential future conditions. We ran 100 bootstrap replicates in Maxent, and the median output was used in analyses. The median of medians across all GCMs for each RCP was as a best guess of conditions under that RCP, and final models were thresholded based on a maximum allowable omission error rate of 5% (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> = 5%; [
 <xref rid="pone.0163863.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]), assuming that up to 5% of occurrence data may include errors that misrepresented environmental values. Uncertainty associated with the models was estimated as the range (maximumâ€“minimum) of suitability across models for each RCP [
