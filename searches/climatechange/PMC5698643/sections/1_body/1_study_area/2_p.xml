<p class="p">Located next to the Swedish border in southeast Norway (60°10′ N, 12°30′ E), the study area covers about 100 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, of which the 40 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> eastern part of the Varald State Forest constituted an intensively monitored core area. The gently undulating terrain between 200 and 400 m a.s.l. consists of Norway spruce 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic> and Scots pine 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus silvestris</italic> interspersed with scattered birch 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> spp. and aspen 
 <italic class="italic">Populus tremula</italic>. A widely distributed dwarf shrub in the field layer is bilberry 
 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium myrtillus,</italic> an important food plant of forest grouse, including newly hatched broods. The ground-nesting black grouse and capercaillie are large (approximately 1–3 kg live weight, respectively), ground-nesting birds which hatch their 7–9 precocial and nidifugous chicks in early June. Owing to poorly developed thermoregulation during 3–4 days after hatching, the chicks are quite vulnerable to cold weather [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and geometrid and sawfly caterpillars are their main food during their first weeks of life [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. In the study area, the two species occur at moderate densities of 2.5–3 birds km

 <italic class="italic">Martes martes</italic>, goshawk,
