<p class="p">Contiguous with other mixed coniferous forests on all sides—only interspersed with small patches of small abandoned farmlands—the forest has been subjected to timber harvesting for several centuries. Notably, in the 1950s, clear-cutting became the main harvesting regime, replacing the traditional high-grading and selection methods. Cutting blocks were initially rather large (more than 50 ha in the 1960s–1970s), but have successively been reduced in size, today rarely exceeding 20 ha. During the last four decades, the coverage of semi-natural old coniferous forests has decreased to less than 20%, the remaining consisting of middle-aged and young silvicultural stands of pure and mixed plantations of spruce and pine.
