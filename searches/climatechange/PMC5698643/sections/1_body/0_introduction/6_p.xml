<p class="p">In a summary article from a long-term study of the population ecology of capercaillie and black grouse in our study area (Varaldskogen, southeast Norway), we reported that the breeding success of both capercaillie and black grouse increased gradually during a 30-year period from 1979 to 2009 [

In view of the current focus on the possible negative effects of warmer springs, we here examine the relationship between spring and early summer temperatures and breeding success from this population study in more detail. The results related to the timing of breeding and chick food cited above [
