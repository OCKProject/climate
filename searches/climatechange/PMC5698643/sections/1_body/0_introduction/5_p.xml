They speculated that the sudden burst of nutritious new plant growth that had previously accompanied an abrupt increase in spring temperature became slower and more erratic. Slower-growing plant food is less nutritious and so the hens' diet became less nutritious, and their eggs and chicks less viable. Lastly, breeding performance of black grouse with climate change has been investigated by Barnagaud
