<p class="p">Until recently, studies of the effects of climate change on non-migratory birds have mainly dealt with passerines. In the temperate zone, only four studies have reported on the larger tetraonids. In Finland, Ludwig

 <italic class="italic">Tetrao tetrix,</italic> from time-series data and showed that earlier mating in later years correlated with increasing temperatures during April and May. As temperature during hatching in June decreased slightly, they inferred that earlier hatching would increase the mortality of chicks because they would then be born in colder weather and with less food for the hatchlings. They concluded that the asymmetrical rise in temperature and mismatch in breeding phenology probably explained the ongoing decline in black grouse in the country. However, a later study of capercaillie,
