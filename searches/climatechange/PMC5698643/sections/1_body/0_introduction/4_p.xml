<p class="p">A different scenario of climate change leading to reduced breeding success (i.e. number of chicks reared per female) in forest grouse was launched by Selås

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] from Norway: following peak seed years of bilberry, 
 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium myrtillus</italic>—a main food plant and host of caterpillar food for the chicks—breeding success should be enhanced due to reduced feeding deterrents in the plants. However, in years with particularly high summer temperatures, bilberry will be less exhausted and rebuild their chemical defence quickly, therefore leading to poorer breeding the following year. They examined weather records and time-series data on abundances of capercaillie and black grouse and reported an inverse relationship with high summer temperatures during 1 or 2 years before peak bilberry seed production. From this, they predicted that warmer summers would limit grouse reproduction.
