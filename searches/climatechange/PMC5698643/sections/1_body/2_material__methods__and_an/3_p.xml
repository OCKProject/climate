<p class="p">Capercaillie and black grouse are both polygynous, lekking species, with females visiting the leks during 5–10 days in late April and early May [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. In capercaillie, most females mate over the course of 3–4 days, whereas for black grouse leks, mating takes place over a longer period, peaking 4–7 days later than in capercaillie in our study area (unpublished material). Each year, we sampled 4–6 capercaillie leks and recorded the dates of female attendance and mating, from which we could estimate the peak of mating. From the known time of mating and hatching of 23 radio-collared females, we could then estimate the average number of days from mating until hatching in this species. Black grouse leks were not systematically monitored; although male counts were made on 3–4 leks each year, female attendance and mating were recorded only intermittently. For this species, the annual date of hatching was estimated from the monitoring of 12 radio-collared females and from observed differences in hatching dates in the two species in the same year [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Based on these data, we have used 5 days later date of mating and 6 days later date of hatching in black grouse compared to capercaillie throughout the study period.
