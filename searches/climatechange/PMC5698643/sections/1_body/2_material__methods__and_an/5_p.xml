<p class="p">In Fennoscandia, predation on eggs and chicks varies with cyclic small rodents—the so-called alternative prey hypothesis [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In years with high abundance of small rodents, predators—mainly red fox and pine marten—prey and subsist mainly on this food source, whereas in crash years they switch to other food, of which grouse eggs and chicks make up a large proportion. This temporal variation in predation pressure has been shown to be an important determinant of breeding success in forest grouse [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Hence, we included information on changes in abundances of small rodents and red fox in the analyses. Rodents were sampled each year in the study area [
