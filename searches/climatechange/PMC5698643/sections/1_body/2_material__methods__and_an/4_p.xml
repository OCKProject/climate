<p class="p">Breeding success is the outcome of mainly two life-history traits, the loss of eggs plus the loss of chicks. In addition, a variable but small number of females do not attempt breeding or desert their nests, and some eggs do not hatch; in capercaillie the proportion of non-breeders is thought to be higher than in black grouse, presumably because some yearling females do not breed. In August, brood frequency (i.e. the proportion of females with at least one chick) therefore largely reflects the rate of egg loss, whereas brood size (i.e. the number of chicks per brood) indicates closely the rate of chick loss after hatching. Hence, their relative proportions of the breeding success before and after hatching point to the causal factors in these two periods of the breeding season. We therefore examined these two components separately in the analyses.</p>
