<p class="p">From the daily spring and summer temperature series, we derived monthly means (April, May, and June) and means for 13 successive time periods throughout the breeding season. Long-term trends were compared using generalized least-squares (GLS) regressions with and without AR(1) and AR(2) correlation structure. Overall, autocorrelation was low and statistically non-significant with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) values similar or lower for models without autoregressive corrections. Throughout the results, we therefore report ordinary least square regression coefficients (

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]). As no significant autocorrelation was detected, we also here report statistics of ordinary least square regressions. We used multiple regression to separate the contributions of temperature and other influential variables (e.g. rodents, fox, precipitation etc.). Right-skewed variables (red fox and rodents) were transformed using log- or square-root values.
