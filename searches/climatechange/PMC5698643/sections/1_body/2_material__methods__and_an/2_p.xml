<p class="p">The abundance and sex/age composition of capercaillie and black grouse were sampled each August by teams using trained pointing dogs; a method commonly used for censusing tetraonids [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The study area was subdivided into 42 sampling blocks, within which observers with dogs searched for birds. Rarely was the whole block sampled thoroughly enough for converting the number of birds encountered to a density estimate. Instead, the number of different bird categories was expressed as numbers/10 h of sampling time. A random selection of blocks was sampled each year, covering at least 60% of the study area. During sampling, each man/dog team was equipped with a map of the block, and a form on which to record encountered birds and time of observation. On the map, the corresponding locations and flight directions were recorded; this was done in order to minimize double counts of birds within the same block or of birds flying into neighbouring blocks sampled the same day. Altogether, between 112 and 186 birds were recorded and classified each year, totalling nearly 6 000 observations over the 38-year period.
