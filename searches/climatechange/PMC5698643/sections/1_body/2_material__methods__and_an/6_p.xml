<p class="p">Weather variables included daily minimum, average and maximum temperatures, precipitation, and the amount of snow cover. Data were obtained from Kongsvinger meteorological station, located 25 km from the study area. With our study area situated at a slightly higher elevation, local differences were adjusted for by applying a lapse rate of 0.65-degree change per 100 m difference in elevation. We used two variables to indicate the phenological onset of spring: the date of snow-free ground and the date of frost-free nights. The first was defined as the earliest date that the meteorological station reported less than 20% snow cover (score 0 on a scale from 0–5). The latter was calculated as the date when the 7-day moving average of the daily minimum temperature crossed 0°C. To indicate the temporal onset of summer, we looked at the cumulative temperature sum. Growing degree days (GDD) is defined as the number of temperature degree days above a certain threshold base temperature. Here we used a base temperature of 5°C and defined the onset of summer as the date when GDD reached 200 degree days, which in our study area closely matched the date when the growth of the new shoots and leaves of bilberry is completed (P Wegge 2017, unpublished data).</p>
