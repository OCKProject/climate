<p class="p">The breeding success of both capercaillie and black grouse increased markedly during the 38-year period, with an absolute increase of 0.57 and 0.62 chicks per female, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20171528F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>). Owing to overall lower breeding success in capercaillie, the proportional trend appeared to rise steeper than in black grouse (62 versus 38%). However, due to large year-to-year variation, the relative difference between the two species was not statistically significant (log-ratio 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.0019, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1.21, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.23). The two demographic traits that determine breeding success—brood frequency and brood size—both displayed upward trends during the study period, although this was statistically significant only for brood frequency in capercaillie (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSPB20171528F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">d</italic>). In relative terms, brood frequency appeared to have increased more than brood size in capercaillie (normalized 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> of 0.034 versus 0.014), but the difference was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1.00, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.32). In black grouse, the two traits contributed roughly equally to the overall increase in breeding success (normalized 
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> of 0.020 versus 0.024).
