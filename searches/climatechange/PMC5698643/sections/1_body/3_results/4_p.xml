<p class="p">In a series of regressions, we examined the annual relationships between breeding success and temperature in 13 time periods throughout the breeding season. As several successive periods were highly correlated, we restricted the results to the following four sub-periods: eight weeks pre-hatching, subdivided into four weeks pre-incubating and incubating periods, plus four weeks post-hatching (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). Overall, breeding success increased with warmer springs, but the effects of rising temperature differed somewhat between the species. In capercaillie, breeding success increased significantly with the minimum temperature during eight weeks pre-hatching and four weeks post-hatching. Broken down to the two contributing components, brood frequency increased with increasing temperature both during the pre- and post-hatch periods, whereas brood size only increased with temperature post-hatching. In black grouse, breeding success increased only with the minimum temperature during four weeks post-hatching, seemingly caused by a significant correlation between brood size and the minimum temperature during that period. When comparing the effects of rising temperature on the demographic traits between the two species, statistically significant differences were discernible only for brood frequency during pre-hatch periods (
