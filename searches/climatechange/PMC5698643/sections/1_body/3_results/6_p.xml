<p class="p">In Fennoscandia, predation on eggs and chicks varies with cyclic small rodents. This also applied to our study; hence, the positive effects of warmer springs might instead have been due to changes in rodent cycles or numbers of key predators. We therefore inspected the partial contribution of warmer temperatures after controlling for small rodent and red fox abundances (

 <italic class="italic">viz</italic>. the relationship between brood frequency of capercaillie and minimum temperature four weeks after hatching was no longer statistically significant but still positive (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.16). In black grouse, breeding success and brood size were no longer significantly correlated with minimum temperature four weeks post-hatching, but the tendencies were also here still positive (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.11 and 0.10, respectively). The number of small rodents correlated with the summer temperature in the same year (

 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.38, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02), and fox abundances increased the year after rodent peaks (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.078, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.34, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.04). We also examined if there was any relationship between the production of fledged chicks and summer temperatures 1 or 2 years earlier. No correlations were found in any of the two species (
