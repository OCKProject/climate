<p class="p">The increase in April temperature caused the snow to disappear earlier; snow-free ground occurred 17–18 days earlier (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.46, s.e. = 0.161), and the date of frost-free nights occurred 19–20 days earlier (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.51, s.e. = 0.137), thus providing earlier access to ground foods before mating. However, both species responded little to earlier springs; mating time (and subsequent hatching time) advanced only 4–5 days throughout the study period (

 <sub class="sub">5</sub> of 200) only advanced 4–5 days, coincidentally paralleling the trend lines of hatching time in capercaillie and black grouse but with markedly larger year-to-year variation (
