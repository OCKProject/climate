<p class="p">Overall, the temperature during the whole breeding season (April, May, and June combined) increased about two degrees throughout the 38-year period (

The temperature change was most pronounced in April (the pre-incubation period), when the minimum, average, and maximum temperatures rose 1.9, 2.6, and 3.8 degrees, respectively. In June, the temperature changed less, and only the minimum temperature increased more than 1 degree (

The minimum, average, and maximum daily temperatures were highly cross-correlated, but minimum daily temperature correlated best with breeding success in both species. The minimum daily temperature also had the smallest year-to-year variation (standard errors,
