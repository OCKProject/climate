<p class="p">In the Scottish study [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], declining capercaillie breeding success during 1975–1999 correlated with a lower rise in temperature during the month of April due to a cooling period in the middle of the month. Poorer nutrition before incubation was offered as a plausible explanation. Contrasting the situation in Scotland—possibly due to different time periods—April temperatures rose markedly in our study, correlating with better breeding. However, in both studies, the effects on the physical condition of females prior to mating and incubation might have been a causal factor for the contrasting results. The study of black grouse in the French Alps [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] found no long-term effects on breeding success from changing winter and summer climate measured by the North Atlantic Oscillations; only short-term effects of extreme weather were detected. Possible impacts of changing spring weather were not assessed, but no declining trend in productivity was detected during the 17-year study period.
