<p class="p">During the 38-year period, spring temperatures increased and so did the breeding success of both species. Closer analyses of annual variations showed a significant positive relationship between breeding success and temperatures during the whole breeding season (one month pre-laying to eight weeks post-hatching). No long-term trend was detected in the precipitation pattern in the breeding season, and no relationship was detected between breeding success and precipitation after hatching during a 30-year period [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. In both species, the peak of mating (in late April) advanced 4â€“5 days during the study period. April was also the period when the temperature rise was most pronounced. Hence, to some extent, the temporal mating skew supports the general notion that mating in birds is triggered by rising temperatures [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, because the onset of spring has advanced almost three weeks, the rather short forward skew of mating time reflects that breeding in northern latitudes is more closely controlled by the photoperiod [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. As opposed to the pronounced rise in early spring temperatures, the temperature at hatching time in early June changed little. Hence, the small forward skew at hatching means that the chicks were exposed to about the same temperature as if the time of mating had remained constant.
