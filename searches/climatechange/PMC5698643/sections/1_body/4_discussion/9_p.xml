<p class="p">Caterpillars are closely linked to their host plants, and hatching and irruption normally occur in synchrony with bud burst and sprouting of new leaves [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. For insectivorous birds, warmer springs may have adverse effects on their breeding due to phenological mismatches at one or two successive stages. Firstly, and as shown by Visser &amp; Holleman [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], the caterpillars may erupt before the host plant/tree has started new leaf growth, leading to subsequent die-offs of larval food before the birds hatch. Secondly, even if the phenology of both host and caterpillars match, both may advance more than the time of bird mating [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. There is recent evidence that the first type of mismatch—the one between host plant and caterpillar hatching—may over time be ‘repaired’ by adaptation; in the winter moth 
 <italic class="italic">Operopthera brumata</italic>, hatching too early was reduced by site-specific selection of successful, late-hatching eggs [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. So far, adaptation among birds for earlier breeding to match the temporal advancement in food has mostly been dealt with on theoretical grounds [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. As breeding in birds, at least in mono-breeding species, is more strictly regulated by the photoperiod [

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], warmer springs are likely to advance the temporal occurrence of invertebrate foods more than the onset of bird breeding, at least in a short-time perspective.
