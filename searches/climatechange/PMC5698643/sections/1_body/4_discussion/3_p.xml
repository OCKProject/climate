<p class="p">From analysing the two demographic components that determine chick production separately, our results indicate that an increase in brood frequency may have contributed relatively more to the increasing breeding success than an increase in the size of broods in capercaillie. Brood frequency was the only trait that differed significantly between the two species, as it was strongly influenced by warmer springs during pre-hatching periods in capercaillie but not in black grouse. This again suggests that reduced egg loss—possibly combined with more yearlings breeding—rather than higher survival of hatched chicks has been most influential. We do not have information on nest predation in recent years, but during the first part of the study period, nest predation of capercaillie was quite high, averaging more than 50% annually during the 1980s [

The earlier ‘green-up’ due to the advancement of spring may have increased the availability of various food sources like small mammals, amphibians, and remains from winter kills for generalist predators, thereby lessening the pressure on grouse eggs. Simultaneously, the longer pre-hatching period with emerging new plant growth provided more cover and nutritive foods for females prior to mating and during incubation. For instance, the bog cottongrass,

Presumably, the earlier access to nutritious ground foods improved the physical condition of females, shortening their need for recesses and exposure to nest predators.
