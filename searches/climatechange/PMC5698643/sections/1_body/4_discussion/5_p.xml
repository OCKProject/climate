 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] was not supported by our results. Although there was a skew towards earlier mating in warmer springs in our study (in magnitude similar to the results reported in the Finnish study), this skew was small compared to the much earlier snow-free ground and associated effects on plant phenology. In a previous study, Wegge

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>] reported that an earlier spring had little impact on the timing of peak caterpillar abundance in early summer. As the peak of geometrid and sawfly larvae stretched over more than 10 days [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], this ‘mismatch’ due to earlier hatching must have been negligible and not created any food shortage. Instead, the discrepancy between the results in our study and that reported from Finland is most probably due to different trends in the early summer temperatures: in the Finnish study—spanning an earlier time period than ours—post-hatching temperature decreased, leading to chicks hatching in slightly colder weather than ‘normal’, whereas in our study, summer temperatures changed very little.
