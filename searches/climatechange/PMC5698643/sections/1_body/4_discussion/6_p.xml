<p class="p">Neither do our results support the prediction that forest grouse reproduction should decline after warm summers due to lower food quality mediated through changes in the chemical deterrents in the bilberry food plant [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Our analyses showed no relationship between summer temperatures 1 or 2 years earlier in either of the two species, as was the basis for this prediction. If the nutritive quality of chick food indeed is reduced by preceding high summer temperatures, then such an effect must have been minimal and certainly has not overridden other determinants of breeding success. In our study, not only the breeding success of grouse but also the abundance of small rodents correlated positively with summer temperature the same year. Presumably, the predation rate on eggs and chicks was then relaxed, leading to better breeding success. Hence, a negative relationship between preceding summer temperatures and breeding success, as inferred by Sel√•s 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], might instead have been caused by changing predation rates related to the vole cycle.
