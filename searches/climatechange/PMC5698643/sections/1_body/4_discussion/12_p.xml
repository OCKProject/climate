<p class="p">Summing up, our study does not lend evidence to the general notion that warmer climate will adversely affect the reproduction of birds and animals in northern latitudes [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Instead, we found that the reproductive output of two species of boreal forest grouse increased along with warmer and earlier springs. However, our study only assessed the impact on breeding performance. Through effects on environmental variables, a warmer climate may have adverse effects on other demographic processes, for instance on the survival of adult birds, thereby dampening or nullifying the positive effects on reproductive output. A recent study of the same populations [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] showed that, in spite of increasing trends in breeding success, the population sizes of both species remained more or less constant. As pointed out by Stenseth &amp; Mysterud [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] and Winkler 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], climate change—with its impact on phenology—is likely to affect several life-history traits and therefore calls for an all-embracing examination in order to identify critical relationships.
