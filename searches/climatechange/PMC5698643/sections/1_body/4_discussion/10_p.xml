<p class="p">As a larger mono-brooding species with the time of breeding strongly regulated by the photoperiod, we would expect boreal forest grouse to be adversely affected by warmer springs. Our results do not support this prediction; instead we show that reproductive output was enhanced—not reduced—in earlier and warmer springs. Why this contradictory result? So far, the extent of temporal mismatching caused by warmer springs—asynchrony between hatching time and optimum food sources and/or weather conditions for chicks—has not been critically examined for boreal grouse. In our study, breeding success was highest when the birds hatched around the time when bilberry shoot growth was completed, indicated by a GDD

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], the first to measure the phenology of caterpillars in bilberry-dominated vegetation, found little temporal difference in the timing of the combined geometrid and sawfly caterpillar peak between a warm spring with early grouse breeding and a colder spring with late breeding; in both years the caterpillar peak lasted nearly two weeks. In northern coniferous forests, snow covers the ground in early April, which might preclude rising temperatures in April from stimulating new growth in bilberry, thereby maintaining closer synchrony between the emergence of caterpillars and new growth of their host plant.
