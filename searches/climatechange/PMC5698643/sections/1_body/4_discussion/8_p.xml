<p class="p">The effects of warmer springs—and climate change in general—probably affect the breeding performance of larger, mono-brooding species differently than the smaller, multi-brooding species. In the former, the total time from mating until brood independence is about four months, whereas passerine nestlings fledge

 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], these species have limited opportunities to repair a failed breeding attempt. Passerines, on the contrary, have multiple such attempts and also raise more than one brood during favourable conditions. Logically, therefore, a mismatch in the larger mono-brooding species like grouse is likely to influence the breeding success more negatively than among the smaller passerines.
