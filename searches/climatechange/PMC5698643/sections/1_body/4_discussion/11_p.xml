<p class="p">If the temporal relationships between caterpillar abundance and spring weather remain more or less unaltered in bilberry habitats, warmer springs may not adversely affect the availability of food for the chicks. Also, and in contrast with the study of black grouse breeding in Finland [
 <xref rid="RSPB20171528C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], the temperature during hatching in early June is increasing, albeit much less than during the pre-hatching periods. From the influences of earlier and warmer springs on vegetation and breeding phenology—as reported in this study—we therefore predict that breeding success will not be adversely affected; warmer springs may even enhance the breeding performance of boreal forest grouse. However, because the caterpillar food source plays a crucial role in the breeding performance of these species, the temporal relationships between bilberry leafing and caterpillars—and how they vary with spring temperatures—need to be thoroughly examined.
