<p id="Par25" class="p">In this study we assessed the hydroclimatology of the 10 major West African river basins under 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming scenarios using a comprehensive ensemble of CORDEX regional climate model experiments. The results indicate that, under a relatively moderate rise of global temperature of 2 °C, the combined increases in CWD and smaller mixed changes in 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic> cause IWN to increase considerably regardless of the 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> formulation. Such increases outweigh the projected WA changes even in regions where WA increases. For example, in western Gulf of Guinea, Niger and Central, where WA increases, changes in IWN are greater. This implies that the projected WA will not be sufficient to compensate for the projected IWN. Therefore, as climate warms, the potential to sustain irrigated agriculture or other activities that require large amounts of water such as hydropower is projected to decrease. A relatively small decrease in global warming from 2 °C to 1.5 °C significantly reduces the gap between IWN and WA greatly reducing the negative consequences of climate change on water resources. It should be emphasized that although some uncertainties are present in these projections, they are mostly in the magnitude of the changes as most of the models project negative changes.
