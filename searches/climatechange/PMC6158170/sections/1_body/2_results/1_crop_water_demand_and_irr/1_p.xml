<p id="Par19" class="p">CWD is related to the amount of water needed by a crop for optimal growth and is defined here as 
 <italic class="italic">ET</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. While in reality, some crops experience CWD higher than ET
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and others less, this analysis provides a general understanding of how demands are projected to change in a warmer climate. Two methods (Hamon and Hargreaves) are used here to assess the projected change for the sake of robustness (see Analysis Approach). In the 2 °C global warming scenario, warmer temperatures result in an average increase in CWD by up to 10% to 15% with respect to the reference period in all major West African river basins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). While the Hargreaves formulation shows uniform changes throughout all basins (8% to 10%), the Hamon formulation shows more spatial variability. For example, the semi-arid Senegal, Niger and Chad basins of Sahel (north of 10°N) experience changes up to 15% and the more humid Sassandra, Bandama, Comoe, Mono, Oueme, southern Volta and Lower Niger basins of the Gulf of Guinea (south of 10°N) experience changes lower than 12%. If the future global warming is held to 1.5 °C, the projected changes are reduced by as much as 50% with the smallest changes in the Gulf of Guinea basins. It is worth noting that, although CWD increases in both

 </sub> formulations, that of Hamon generally simulates higher changes than that of Hargreaves due its higher known sensitivity to temperature changes
