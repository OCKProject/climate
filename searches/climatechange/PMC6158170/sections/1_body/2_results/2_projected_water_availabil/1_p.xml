 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). On one hand, in Senegal, Gambia, central Niger, northern Volta and northern and southern Chad, decreased precipitation (see Fig.

 <italic class="italic">ET</italic> (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">SI2</xref>) combine to reduce WA up to 30% compared to the reference period. On the other hand, in the smaller basins of the Gulf of Guinea, such as Sassandra, Bandama, Comoe, as well as northern Niger and central Chad, the increased precipitation overcompensates the increased

 </sup> who project positive changes in the upper Niger basin. Limiting global warming to 1.5 °C, decreases the negative changes and their spatial extent and strengthens and increases the spatial extent of positive changes in the Chad and Niger basins by as much as 60%. In addition, in Senegal and Gambia, the magnitude of negative changes is limited to 15% and in Sassandra, Bandama and the adjacent section of the Niger basin, the increases are limited to 10%.
