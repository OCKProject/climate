<p id="Par16" class="p">Since the development of water storage systems would potentially allow farmers to utilize water resources outside of the rainy season, the analysis is performed over the entire year and not just limited to the monsoon or growing seasons. This assumes a best-case scenario in the sense that West Africa in the future will improve its water resources infrastructure to best utilize its surface water and ground water resources to compensate for seasonal and inter-seasonal changes in rainfall. Annual changes are calculated as the difference between the future scenarios (1.5 °C or 2 °C global warming) minus the reference period (0.48 °C global warming). While future changes are expressed as percent of reference period values, the difference between the changes of the two scenarios are expressed as percent of the 1.5 °C scenario value.</p>
