<p id="Par8" class="p">The 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming scenarios are derived by extracting from each RCM simulation the 30-year period when the driving GCM projects an increase of 1.5 °C and 2 °C of global warming, respectively, compared to the pre-industrial level. Similarly, the historical reference period is taken from each RCM simulation as the 30-year period when the driving GCM simulates increase of 0.48 °C of global warming compared to the pre-industrial level. The different periods defined for 0.48 °C, 1.5 °C and 2 °C for each driving GCM are summarized in Table SI1. After the extraction of these periods from each RCM simulation, the multimodel ensemble is performed for 0.48 °C (i.e. reference period), 1.5 °C and 2 °C (future periods), respectively. Analyzing the simulations in this manner eliminates uncertainties related to emissions pathways, the choice of the baseline (i.e. the reference period) and of the future periods as well as to the propagation of the driving GCMs present-day temperature biases into the future. In addition, the large multimodel ensemble reduces uncertainty from intermodel variability and best represents the response of the climate system to an imposed forcing
