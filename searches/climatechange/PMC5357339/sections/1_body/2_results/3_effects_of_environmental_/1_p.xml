<p class="p">The jackknife evaluation procedure suggested that GDD was the most important predictor for all three species.

 <sub class="sub">min</sub> was the second most important variable for perennial and giant ragweed, and WBAL was the second most important variable for common ragweed (

 <sub class="sub">min</sub>. Habitat suitability of common ragweed and giant ragweed showed a similar increasing response to WBAL, whereas habitat suitability for perennial ragweed showed a hump-shaped relationship with WBAL values ranging from ca. −1,000 to 1,000 mm. Across species, WBAL had the strongest impact for common ragweed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). All species had their highest estimated habitat suitability for

 <sub class="sub">min</sub> values ranging from approximately −30 to 10 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). MESS comparison of the environmental factors in Europe indicated very little extrapolation outside the range of the native conditions. Specifically, more than 99% of grid cells for both the present-day and future climate conditions fell within the range of the native climate conditions (
