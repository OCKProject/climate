<p class="p">In Europe, all models predicted that climatically suitable areas for ragweed will become more widespread on the continent by year 2100 (following IPCC climate change scenarios RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). At present, the ragweed ‘high allergy risk’ (HAR) areas are found mostly in Southern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Fig. S4</xref>). The models show a substantial increase of HAR areas across Europe by 2100 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For common ragweed the HAR areas with maximum habitat suitability increased 100% (RCP 6.0) and 45% (RCP 8.5), respectively, with most new areas located in Northern (e.g., Denmark, United Kingdom) and Eastern Europe (e.g., the Baltic countries) (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For perennial ragweed models predicted an increase of 127% (RCP 6.0) and 189% (RCP 8.5), with new areas located across most of Central and Eastern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). For giant ragweed, the HAR area increased by 97% for the RCP 6.0 projections but decreased by 69% for the RCP 8.5 projections. New habitats occurred especially in Russia, the Baltic countries and Southeastern Europe (
