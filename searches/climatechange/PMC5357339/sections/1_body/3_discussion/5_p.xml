<p class="p">While the results of this study can inform future management strategies addressing climate change and increasing human disturbance, there is a need to acknowledge the caveats embedded in all climate model studies (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araujo &amp; Guisan, 2006</xref>). For instance, our model does not take into consideration anthropogenic factors like disturbance, land use and propagule pressure, which will be crucial in controlling range filling within the potential range set by the climatic variables. Including such parameters in future model-work will allow us to expand knowledge and predictability of the distribution of invasive allergenic species (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Local adaptation is another parameter that may affect the distribution of species and their response to climate change. Intra-population local adaption has been shown to allow species to survive in otherwise unfavorable conditions (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, incorporation of physiological performance/phenology of ragweed throughout their distribution would be beneficial in future work to estimate range expansion at regional or local scales (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2014</xref>). For now, our results demonstrate that future climate changes could result in a large expansion of

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). In Northern and Eastern Europe, focus should primarily be on restricting further invasion and establishment of ragweed (

 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cunze, Leiblein &amp; Tackenberg, 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Storkey et al., 2014</xref>). The most important factor for successful invasion by ragweed is propagule pressure, both in terms of number of introductions and number of propagules released (
 <xref rid="ref-40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lockwood, Cassey &amp; Blackburn, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gladieux et al., 2011</xref>). Ragweeds are species that propagate exclusively by seeds. Long-distance dispersal of ragweed seeds is mostly dependent on anthropogenic forces, including import of contaminated birdseeds and crops (e.g., maize and soya beans), transport of contaminated soil, and seed infested agricultural machines (

 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2016</xref>). Seeds may remain dormant for as long as 40 years (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bassett &amp; Crompton, 1975</xref>) if conditions are unfavorable, calling for a long term effort in controlling ragweed invasion. All these aspects illustrate the importance of cross-countries management planning in order to prevent and control future spread of these allergenic bioinvaders.
