 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziska et al., 2003</xref>). Our models indicate that future ragweed HAR areas will overlap with major cities in Europe including St. Petersburg, Hamburg and Paris. Ragweeds future distribution may therefore affect large populations across Europe. A higher overall abundance of ragweed species also increases the risk of long-distance transport of allergenic pollen (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grewling et al., 2016</xref>). Ragweed pollen can disperse 100’s of kilometers (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bullock et al., 2013</xref>), thus affecting allergic persons in areas without established ragweed populations. This has already been shown using complex cluster backward trajectories (

(2015)</xref> estimated that airborne ragweed pollen concentration will increase about four times by 2050, dispersing pollen across large regions of Europe. The low atmospheric concentration of ragweed pollen necessary to induce allergic reactions in sensitive patients (∼5 grains m
