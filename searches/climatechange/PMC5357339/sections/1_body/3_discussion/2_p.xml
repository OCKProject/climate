<p class="p">Our results for common ragweed agree with those of 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cunze, Leiblein &amp; Tackenberg (2013)</xref> in predicting an increased habitat suitability of common ragweed in Europe, particularly towards Northern and Eastern Europe. These authors, however, did not quantify the extent of the increase in areas where allergenic problems may be expected as a consequence of climatic changes. The majority of ragweed-studies so far have exclusively investigated common ragweed. However, considering that pollen of ragweed species is morphologically similar and give similar allergenic reactions (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frenz, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziska et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sikoparija et al., 2016</xref>), it is important to consider multiple ragweed species and climate scenarios when predicting future increases in habitat suitability of allergenic ragweeds. Specifically, depending on the species and RCP used, our models estimated a change in ragweed HAR areas ranging from a loss of 11,690 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (giant ragweed, RCP 8.5) to an increase of 89,500 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (common ragweed RCP 6.0), affecting in particular Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden and the Baltic countries. Surprisingly, the more severe climate change scenario (RCP 8.5) did not facilitate an expansion of ragweeds further north compared to the milder scenario (RCP 6.0). In fact, the largest extent of suitable habitats was found under RCP 6.0 for both common and giant ragweed. We note that the northward expansion of ragweed species will be controlled by biological constraints in addition to climate variables (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deen, Hunt &amp; Swanton, 1998</xref>). For instance, ragweeds are short-day plants and their flowering is induced by a dark period of approximately eight hours (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deen, Hunt &amp; Swanton, 1998</xref>). Ragweeds are also sensitive to frost, and will not continue to flower when temperatures drop below freezing (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deen, Hunt &amp; Swanton, 1998</xref>). In Northern Europe, growing season length and dark period duration may become insufficient for ragweed species to reproduce despite relatively favorable climatic conditions. Additionally, the lower extent of high habitat suitability for these species under RCP 8.5 could also be associated with drought. We found that both common and giant ragweed perform well under relatively wet conditions, whereas perennial ragweed performs better in drier habitats (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Prolonged drought and dry periods are increasingly expected under RCP 8.5, hence water scarcity provides one potential explanation why perennial ragweed will become most abundant under RCP 8.5 compared to both common and giant ragweed. Overall, we recommend that further work examining ragweed species distributions may be improved by considering important non-climatic variables including, for example, day length.
