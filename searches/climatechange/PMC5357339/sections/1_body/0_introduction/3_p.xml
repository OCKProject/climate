<p class="p">Ragweed populations remain relatively rare in Northern Europe, where low autumn temperatures prevent ragweed species from flowering and reaching reproductive maturity (
 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chapman et al., 2014</xref>). However, global warming is predicted to facilitate a northwards expansion of ragweed species (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Storkey et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Essl et al., 2015</xref>). This can accelerate the establishment and pollen production of self-propagating ragweed populations, and extend the local pollen season in regions currently climatically unsuitable (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gerber et al., 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cunze, Leiblein &amp; Tackenberg, 2013</xref>). Increasing amounts of anthropogenically released carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) also has the potential to increase pollen production (
 <xref rid="ref-56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sheffield, Weinberger &amp; Kinney, 2011</xref>). Studies have shown an increase of up to 61% in ragweed pollen production in a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enriched atmosphere, both in climate-controlled greenhouses and in field based experiments (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziska et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rogers et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, 
 <xref rid="ref-46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patz &amp; Olson (2006)</xref> described how especially plants in urban areas are exposed to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, i.e., from industry and dense traffic. Cities are therefore prone to a disproportionate increase in ragweed pollen production, with serious consequences for public health (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ziska et al., 2003</xref>). This raises concern about the consequences of the increasing frequency of which ragweed species have been registered across continental Europe, where they are now considered bioinvaders (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fernández-Llamazares et al., 2012</xref>). Over future decades, ragweed may become a major source of pollen allergy in Northern Europe, with severe medical and economic implications (
