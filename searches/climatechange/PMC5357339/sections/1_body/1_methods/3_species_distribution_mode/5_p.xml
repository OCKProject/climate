<p class="p">We assessed model performance using Area Under the Curve (AUC) as calculated by MAXENT for the test data (

 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ward, 2007</xref>). AUC values range from 0.5 (i.e., random) for models with no predictive ability to 1.0 (i.e., perfect discrimination between suitable and unsuitable cells) for models with a perfect prediction. According to the classification of 
 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Swets (1988)</xref>, an AUC score of &gt;0.7 (“useful” discrimination ability), &gt;0.8 (“good” model performance) and &gt;0.9 (“very good” model performance) was used. Since models were built for presence-only data, the background data constitute pseudo-absences for the AUC calculations (
