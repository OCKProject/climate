<p class="p">We used MAXENTâ€™s jackknife procedure to assess the relative importance of each variable (i.e., WBAL, 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> and GDD). Briefly, the jackknife tool excludes one variable at a time before running a model, thus testing model performance when different combinations of variables are included. MAXENT then compares the different model results and includes the variables that provide strong individual effects in the final model, and quantifies the relative importance of each variable in the final model.
