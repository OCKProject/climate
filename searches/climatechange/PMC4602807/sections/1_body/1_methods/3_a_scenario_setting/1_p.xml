<p class="p">Two versions of casualty transportation are compared: the conventional and the sequential-conveyance method. Both are shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>. In Panel A, the conventional method imitates the real scene of EMS transportation in Xiaolin village; whereas Panel B represents a virtual scenario of the sequential-conveyance method. In the conventional method, all casualties are sent to different lines of hospitals and as a result, anomalies of poor regulation and cross-communication may occur. This allows further diversions among hospitals (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>: Panel A; dashed lines), which are performed frequently, and they are based on matters such as the emergency department (ED) crowding, the poor prehospital triage, and other problems similar to these.
