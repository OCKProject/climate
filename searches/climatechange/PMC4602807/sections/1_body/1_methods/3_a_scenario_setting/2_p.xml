<p class="p">The reason why Xiaolin village was selected for this study is its arduous casualty transportation. Jiasion elementary school, a safe and open space near the area of Xiaolin village, is chosen as an MEMC in the sequential-conveyance method. According to the records, all the casualties were transferred to 4 hospitals that can be classified into 3 lines. Chishan and Sijhou Hospital (denoted as 1st-L H), Tainan Municipal Hospital (denoted as 2nd-L H) and Chi Mei Medical Center (denoted as 3rd-L H) are assigned as first-line, second-line, and third-line hospital(s), respectively.</p>
