<p class="p">In Panel A of Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>, the y-interceptions of app. TEmax and app. TEmin plots are on the same point (0.6183) because there is no patient available (PR = 0) for further transfer. It appears that the selected MEMC (the school) as a refuge has a time efficiency of 61.83%. Theoretically, the 135 nonpatient survivors are transferred to the 5 recorded refuges with a fixed flow ratio in the conventional method, whereas in the sequential-conveyance method, they are transported to the MEMC. In addition, the y-interception of app. DEmax and app. DEmin is 0.6572 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>: Panel B).
