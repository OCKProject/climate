<p class="p">In the case study of Xiaolin village, values of TE and DE have been applied to evaluate the efficiency of EMS transportation time and distance, respectively. One hundred thirty-five people evacuated this event (p + q = 135) and 16 of them are sent to hospitals (q = 16). The ratios of the survivor flow to different destinations are shown in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>. Accordingly, the evaluation of the efficiency of the transportation time and distance in realistic conditions are TE = 0.5215 (52.15%) and DE = 0.5602 (56.02%) (see Eq. 10 and 17, Supplemental Content,

These values show the predominance of the sequential-conveyance method over the conventional method in transportation time and distance of an EMS transportation.
