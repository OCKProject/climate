<p class="p">We obtained current and future bioclimatic variables at a 30‐s resolution from the WorldClim database (WorldClim.com), and repartition it as grid data with 30 × 30 m size based on its climatic value for matching the resolution of other habitat variables in advance. We only modeled habitat suitability for giant pandas under the climate change scenarios of 2050 to make the projections more effective and applicable on current and impending conservation practices at an expected temporal scale. To minimize collinearity for modeling among 19 bioclimatic variables in the general circulation model (GCM), we employed eight climatic variables (Bio 2, Bio 4, Bio 10, Bio 11, Bio 15, Bio 17, Bio 18, and Bio 19; Table

 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). To avoid the uncertainty of future climate projections from different GCMs, we averaged the value of eight climatic variables of 2050 projected under four selected GCMs using ARCGIS 10.0, and used the average value to form the future climatic raster with 30 × 30 m resolution and to construct climate models. Due to a ban on large‐scale industrial projects in the future within our study area by central and local governments (Jie, Wei, Kan, &amp; Dong, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), the developing model with low CO
