   <p class="p">The location of the tree line ecotone is considered as a particularly sensitive bioclimatic indicator of climate and landscape change (Holtmeier &amp; Broll, 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and climate change will drive the tree line upslope and poleward (Hansen, 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Kittel, Steffen, &amp; Iii,

    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Due to the complexity of projecting the change in the tree line under climate change by models and parameter setting, we made a rough estimation based on the results of a previous study of tree lines in the Qinling Mountains (He, 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). According to the average increase in the tree line by 16.7 m south and 7.6 m north in the Qinling Mountain from 1988 to 2009 by He (
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), the annual rate of tree line growth was estimated as 0.79 m/a in south and 0.36 m/a in north just based on temporal scale. Then, we predicted the tree line would keep growing 30 m south and 14 m north from 2012 to 2050, and made an upward buffer with a distance of 30 m (south) and 14 m (north) in the Qinling Mountains along the boundary of current high elevation forest based on a vegetation map from 2012, and produced a vegetation map for 2050 modeling.

   <p class="p">Although bamboo is the main food source for giant pandas, bamboo and flowering stochasticity has not devastated giant panda genetic diversity historically because this species has evolved a series of adaptive strategies to switch bamboo species and disperse long distances to forage (Zhu, Hu, Qi et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), including 314,807 ha of bamboo in the Qinling Mountains from FNGPS. Furthermore, bamboo always occurs under forests or mixes with other types of vegetation, and its classification and mapping face technical challenges and no basis for projecting dispersal range is available (Tuanmu et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wang et al., 
    <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). With enough spatial range and limitations estimating dynamics, we integrated bamboo into habitat factors but assumed that bamboo remained stable during habitat prediction modeling.

   <p class="p">According to the zoning as major ecological function‐oriented zone and water resource conservation area, we also made an assumption of modeling on the human disturbance that resident community and road network will keep static by banning large‐scale construction of township or community and implementing migration projects of impoverished people living in remote area by government in 2005 (Table
