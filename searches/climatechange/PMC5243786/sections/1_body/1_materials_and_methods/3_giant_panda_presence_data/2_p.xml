<p class="p">The Chinese State Forestry Administration conducted the FNGPS in the Qinling Mountains from April to June 2012 and recorded 1810 sign points indicating the presence of giant pandas including feces, dens, sleeping sites, and footprints (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32650-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). These data were collected at a frequency of one transect per 200 ha across the giant panda range. Latitude, longitude, elevation, slope, vegetation, and bamboo cover at each sign point were recorded. We derived elevation and slope data from a digital elevation model based on 1:50,000 topographic maps obtained from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (

Vegetation with 80% accuracy and bamboo with 70% accuracy in the study area were obtained from the survey and satellite images of Landsat 5 in 2000 and Spot5 in 2012 using the maximum likelihood classification algorithm in supervised classification by Erdas 9.2 (Leica Geosystems GIS and Mapping, 2003, LLC, Atlanta, GA, USA). All above data were applied and approved by the Chinese State Forestry Administration. As the main human‐induced threats to giant pandas (Gong, Meng, Chen, &amp; Song,
