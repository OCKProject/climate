<p class="p">We ran the Maxent model with current and future climatic and environmental variables to assess current habitat suitability and to project changes by 2050. All current and future habitats were divided into ordinary, subsuitable, and suitable based on the habitat suitability index. Using expert knowledge and experience in the identification of habitat suitability (Wood &amp; Dragicevic, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), we calculated the percentage of giant panda signs in each type of habitat to indicate suitability. Then, we created criteria for habitat suitability assessment and set the habitat suitability index as follows: Habitat with 70% of the giant panda signs was suitable, habitat with 20% of the signs was subsuitable, and other habitat was ordinary. We were able to assess habitat suitability and spatial variations under climate change in 2050 using the proportions and spatial pattern of suitable and subsuitable habitats.
