<p class="p">In order to quantify the shift in habitat spatial pattern and fragmentation, patches of suitable and subsuitable habitat were used to analyze dynamics. Latitude, longitude, and elevation at the centroid of all suitable and subsuitable habitat patches between now and 2050 were used to quantify how habitat suitability will shift in direction and elevation using independent samples testing in SPSS 18.0. To understand habitat fragmentation across the landscape, we grouped suitable and subsuitable habitats together and calculated the following indices to assess the dimension of fragmentation (O'Neill et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>): total area (TA); patch number (PN); patch density (PD, number of patches/100 ha in TA); mean patch size (MPS); and largest patch size (LPS). Considering the upward impacts on elevation of climate change on wildlife (Hole et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and further identification of the range of high‐quality habitat loss and fragmentation change in elevation gradient under climate change, all current and future suitable habitat patches were used as the indicator and grouped at an elevation interval of 100 m. We then calculated total size, mean size, and the largest size of habitat patch type every 100 m of elevation and compared changes associated with elevation gradient. Given our aim to quantify shifts in habitat and fragmentation, we restricted the area for which we compared habitat patches within the giant panda distribution as defined by the FNGPS (State Forestry Administration (SFA),
