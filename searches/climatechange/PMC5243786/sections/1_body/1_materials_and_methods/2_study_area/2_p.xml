<p class="p">The Qinling Mountains are home to 18.6% of wild giant pandas and represent the densest population in China based on the FNGPS. The mountains include 596,681.1 ha of giant panda population range, and the conservation network of 14 reserves is the largest reserve network in China (Figure

The mountain range forms a watershed between the Yangtze and Yellow rivers and peaks with Taibai Mountain at 3,767 m above sea level. Several major roads run north–south in the study area (national roads 108 and 210, Xihan expressway). We chose the Qinling Mountains for the following reasons. First, these mountains have a transitional climate between northern subtropical and warm temperate zones and represent a typical area to project the impacts of climate change due to high climatic variability. Second, the giant pandas in the Qinling Mountains are geographically and genetically isolated from other populations and this helps simplify the scenarios for population dispersal and climate change. Third, giant pandas inhabiting mountains should be the most sensitive to climate change and trigger a habitat change or migration based on future scenarios and the edge effects of ecology, high latitude, and high population density (Guralnick,

Due to the great value of this ecosystem, this area is designated as a major ecological function‐oriented zone to protect its ecological function, nature forest protection area to protect its forest resource, and water storage area to protect water resource by the Chinese central government (Fan, Tao, Qing, &amp; Ren,
