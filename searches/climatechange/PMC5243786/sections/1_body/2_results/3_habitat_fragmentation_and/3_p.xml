<p class="p">Climate will greatly affect the suitable habitat elevation pattern. Current suitable habitat is mainly around 2,100 m above sea level, around which 61% of total current suitable habitat occurs; future suitable habitat is mainly around 2,200 m above sea level and represents 60% of total future suitable habitat. The majority of suitable habitat loss will occur under 1,900 m from 32,678.1 ha (current) to 16,102.0 ha (by 2050) with 51% decline, and suitable habitat above 1,900 m will noticeably increase from 88,470.6 ha (current) to 159,210.1 ha (by 2050) with 80% growth following climate change (Table

 <xref rid="ece32650-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). MPS and LPS dynamics for suitable habitat elevation showed similar qualitative and quantitative changes regarding fragmentation and loss as for TA, suitable habitat patch size will increase and become more concentrated with a distinct drop in landscape fragmentation at 2,000–2,400 m above sea level (also the most preferred altitude of giant pandas).
