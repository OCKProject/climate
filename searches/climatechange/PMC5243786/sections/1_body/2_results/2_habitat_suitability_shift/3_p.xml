<p class="p">Both the training AUC (0.91) and test AUC (0.87) indicated reliable model performance (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32650-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Additionally, the correlation between the presence of giant pandas and habitat suitability index was significant (ρ = 0.56, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .05), confirming that our methods captured the relationship between giant panda occurrence and habitat spatial distribution under current climatic conditions. The most important climate variable based on permutation importance was temperature seasonality (Bio4, 25%), followed by precipitation seasonality (Bio15, 23%). Slope was the most important habitat variable (5.8%) among abiotic and biotic habitat factors after climate factors. The disturbance on giant panda habitat from transportation is much higher than disturbance arising from resident community (Figure
