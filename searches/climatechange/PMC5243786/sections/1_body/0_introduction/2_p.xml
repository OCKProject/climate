<p class="p">Climate change since the Last Glacial Maximum has affected wildlife distributions and changed the habitat structures and functions of many species (Maclean &amp; Wilson,

 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). To avoid extirpation due to ongoing climate change, some species adapt to changing habitats in situ, some shift to colonize new areas, and those with poor dispersal ability become locally extinct (Chen &amp; Thomas,

 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Range‐restricted, high‐altitude species are particularly vulnerable to changing climatic conditions because they are commonly characterized by poor dispersal ability, limited food resources, and historically driven habitat fragmentation (Crabtree &amp; Ellis, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). This is the case for giant pandas (
