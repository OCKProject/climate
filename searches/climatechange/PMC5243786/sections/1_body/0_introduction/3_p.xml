<p class="p">Climate change may result in habitat loss and fragmentation and synergistically determine the shifting direction of population ranges, which degrade species fitness at the habitat and/or genetic levels (Brook, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Peacock, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Pyke, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Many studies have projected the dynamics of habitat suitability under climate scenarios to uncover the role of climate change in shaping the distribution of giant pandas and found bamboo shortages, habitat loss, and northward shifts in population range (Fan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Songer, Delion, Biggs, &amp; Huang, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Tuanmu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Few studies have quantified habitat shifts and patterns of habitat fragmentation induced by climate change despite this being a critical component to understanding the impacts of global change on giant pandas. Most calculations of species extinction risk assume that endangered species go extinct when they no longer have suitable habitats because of climate change (Hole et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Species that depend on one specific plant species for survival and reproduction are expected to be more vulnerable to habitat fragmentation, and the giant panda is a typical example (Piessens, Adriaens, Jacquemyn, &amp; Honnay, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Zhu, Hu, Qi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, due to the risk of habitat loss and fragmentation, there is an urgent need to estimate giant panda habitat spatial patterns and fragmentation to clarify key areas and strategies for future conservation planning. Additionally, data in previous studies associating giant panda presence with environmental and climatic variables were based on the results of the Third National Giant Panda Survey (TNGPS) completed in 2000, and need to be updated with the most recent survey data.
