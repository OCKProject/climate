<p class="p">The projected rates of climatic change indicate that range shifts over the next century are likely to be great (Hole et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The most recent IPCC‐CMIP5 climate scenarios and the Fourth National Giant Panda Survey (FNGPS) completed in 2012 provide a great opportunity to develop a complete understanding of the relationship between habitat spatial patterns and climate change using updated, high‐quality population and climate data. Because fringe ecological patches are more sensitive to environmental change (Russell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), we focused on the Qinling Mountains at the northern extent of the giant panda distribution. This study aimed to (1) understand the current status and future changes in giant panda habitat range, suitability, and fragmentation in this Qinling Mountains; (2) quantify the scale of habitat shift according to direction and elevation, and describe spatial dynamics of habitat fragmentation resulting from climate change; and (3) provide conservation recommendations for giant panda regarding population management, reserve networks, and habitat restoration.
