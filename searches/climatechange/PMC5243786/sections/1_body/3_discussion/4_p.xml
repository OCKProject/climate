 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and the dynamics of population pattern (Gong et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), we found an eastern habitat shift and determined the elevation range patterns of habitat fragmentation under climate change. Despite the challenge of habitat loss, fragmentation, and shift due to climate change, the 54,163 ha of new climate‐suitable habitat in the eastern Qinling Mountains will accommodate no less than 51 giant pandas based on basic home range requirements (10.62 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)and provides hope for population expansion (Pan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Actually, giant pandas in the eastern reserves currently face a high probability of local extinction due to small population size and poor genetic diversity, and it is necessary to increase the population size via translocation or the reintroduction of captive individuals.
