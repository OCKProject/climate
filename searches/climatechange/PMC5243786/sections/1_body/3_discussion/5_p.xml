<p class="p">The changes in habitats modeled here mean that a new giant panda conservation plan is needed to respond to climate change. Due to habitat integrity at the landscape scale (Loucks et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), the northeast part of the Qinling Mountains may become suitable habitat, and as it is currently outside the current reserve network, it should be included in current conservation planning and zoning (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32650-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). A new habitat restoration program is also needed to welcome the climate change‐driven migration of giant pandas by 2050 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32650-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Last, a conservation corridor between the large patch of future suitable habitat in the northeast and southeast Qinling Mountains should be built to link future habitats and facilitate population dispersal.
