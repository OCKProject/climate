<p class="p">Habitat fragmentation has always been the main threat to giant pandas (Gong, Yang, Yang, &amp; Song, 
 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) and climate change may pose an additional challenge for conservation. In addition to further fragmentation of subsuitable habitat, climate change will increase risks to giant panda safety. For example, while suitable habitat (&gt;1,900 m elevation) will expand and become more connected because of climate change, areas of lower elevation (&lt;1,900 m elevation) will not be suitable for giant pandas due to exacerbated habitat fragmentation and loss (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32650-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This spatial shift in suitable habitat may force giant pandas to move to higher elevations and result in overcrowding. Based on the current population density of giant pandas from the TNGPS and FNGPS, the population across seven reserves (Taibaishan, Huangboyuan, Laoxiancheng, Zhouzhi, Changqing, Foping, and Guanyinshan) in the central Qinling Mountains has increased from 203 to 237 since 2000 (SFA

 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), from which it can be inferred that a habitat shortage will most likely occur in these areas. Due to the same consideration on carrying capacity locally, giant pandas have often been seen entering the area used by human, such as villages and agricultural land in the central Qinling Mountains (Sina,

 <xref rid="ece32650-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Population safety and risk monitoring programs should be implemented or expanded in this area to respond to habitat fragmentation and loss induced by climate change in the future.
