<p class="p">We appreciate the points raised by Ashcroft and believe this is an important conversation. We also in no way want to argue against using thermal variables other than air temperature, when these are the most salient to research questions. As Ashcroft noted, about one‐third of the studies we examined monitored air temperature with inexpensive data loggers, and it was this one‐third that we evaluated for shielding practices. We do not suggest that the other two‐thirds should have measured air temperature instead of soil, surface, or body temperature. Rather, we suggest that when ecologists do measure air temperature, we must take more care to do so accurately. As we move deeper into the Anthropocene, and as we observe, model, and predict effects of climate change on organisms, accurate air temperature data will be critical. This will improve assessments of ecological costs of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and aid in the development of adaptation strategies. Innovation and creativity are the lifeblood of scientific advancement and should be encouraged at every opportunity. However, with the stakes so high, we also must be vigilant in holding ourselves to a high standard of meticulousness and rigor when documenting the myriad ways that human‐caused warming is affecting the ecology of the planet.</p>
