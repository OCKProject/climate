<p class="p">Finally, Ashcroft notes that the differences between temperatures at ground level and 2 m are greater than the differences between shielded and unshielded sensors, such that, from the perspective of ground‐level organisms, sensor height is a more important source of bias than shielding. We agree that sensor height is an important consideration, but it does not negate the importance of biases in air temperature introduced through inadequate shielding. We showed that even within a study, when sensors are deployed at a consistent height, bias in poorly shielded sensors varied with sun exposure and ground cover. The resulting 3–5°C differences in air temperature are the equivalent of several decades of climate change, or the difference between starkly contrasting socioeconomic scenarios of greenhouse gas management. Such biases within an ecological study could be misleading if the temperatures were accepted as accurate and interpreted relative to climate projections.</p>
