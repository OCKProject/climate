We agree that air temperature is often not the best metric if the goal of a study is to characterize detailed thermobiology of specific organisms or microhabitats. The surface temperatures of a particular stratum hinge on the material's heat capacity and energy absorption potential, often resulting in significant departures from near‚Äêsurface air temperature. These departures can affect physiological processes, particularly for ectotherms, such as insects and reptiles.
