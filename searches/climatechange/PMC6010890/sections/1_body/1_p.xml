<p class="p">However, air temperature often does correlate with organismal‐scale processes, such as phenological timing and species distributions (Thackeray et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33972-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, near‐surface air temperature, typically measured at the standard height of 2 m, is the variable for which extensive temporal and geographic observations are available and is one of the standard output variables produced by globally coordinated climate model experiments (Taylor, Stouffer, &amp; Meehl, 
 <xref rid="ece33972-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Therefore, even when air temperature is only an indirect predictor of a biological process, it still provides a key link between that process and climate data that are available over broad spatial and temporal scales. Such a link is much harder to make with measures such as body temperature of a given species, for which mapped historical records and future projections do not exist as they do for air temperature.
