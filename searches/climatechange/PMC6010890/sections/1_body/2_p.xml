<p class="p">Ashcroft argues that because many species are directly exposed to radiation, using shielded sensors could result in recording temperatures that are biased cold. However, our study clearly shows (table 2, Terando, Youngsteadt, Meineke, &amp; Prado, 
 <xref rid="ece33972-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) that temperatures recorded by radiation‐exposed, inexpensive sensors vary with sensor type, with biases ranging from 1.1°C for the HOBO Pro sensor to 2.2°C for the iButton to 3.4°C for the HOBO pendant. This indicates that the materials surrounding the sensor—stainless steel for the iButton, composite plastic for the HOBO Pendant—are susceptible to additional direct heating that affects the recorded temperature. As such, ecologists should not assume that the temperature recorded by a radiation‐exposed inexpensive sensor will correlate with the temperature experienced by an organism. And, caution is still required when selecting unshielded instruments to ensure that they have similar thermal properties to the organisms or habitat elements under study.
