<p class="p">Recent research has showed that elemental composition of a feedstock is not an indication of plant-nutrient availability in the biochar made out of that feedstock. Freitas et al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) found that available P (Mehlich 3) in biochar made from different feedstocks was not at all proportional to the total P concentration of the feedstocks. X-ray diffraction showed that poultry litter biochar contained the mineral whitlockite (a sparingly soluble Ca-P or Ca-Mg-P form), which might be used as a slow-release P fertilizer (Dari et al., 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, Mehlich 3-extractable 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-values in biochar from different feedstocks were also not proportional to the concentration of the nutrients in the “parent” feedstock. Based on these, Freitas et al. (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) suggested that some nutrient contents of animal-based biochar (e.g., K) would not necessarily be higher than those of plant-based biochars.
