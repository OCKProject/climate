<p class="p">Biochar + compost mixtures are becoming popular for improving soil fertility and plant growth (Schulz and Glaser, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Prost et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), especially when biochar is mixed with biomass before composting. A recent review by Godlewska et al. (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) has pointed out that the effect of biochar on composting depends on biochar and feedstock properties. Some studies indicate the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups during composting, which leads to increase in nutrient retention (Schulz et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This practice allows a higher nutrient retention in the biomass, adding to the value of the final product. As concluded by Wu et al. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) in another recent review, biochar and composting could alter the physico-chemical properties of both materials. The combination of biochar with compost seems to be a promising source of amendment and an interesting alternative to inorganic fertilizer.
