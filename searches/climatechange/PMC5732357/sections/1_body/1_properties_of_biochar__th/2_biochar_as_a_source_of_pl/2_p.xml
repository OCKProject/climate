<p class="p">The existence of such variability in biochar properties has been well-established (Ippolito et al., 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), but information on the reasons for such differences is scanty. Pyrolysis is conducted at varying temperatures (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>), and the temperature is reported to have effect on the quality of biochar produced; a definitive relationship between the two, however, has not been established. Other processing differences could lead to different biochar properties. Thus, it could well be that biochars prepared from the same feedstock could have different characteristics depending on pyrolysis temperature and other conditions.
