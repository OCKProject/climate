<p class="p">Besides greenhouse and laboratory experiments, some field studies have been reported on agricultural use of biochar as a nutrient source and soil amendment (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">1</xref>). However, as concluded in a recent review by Agegnehu et al. (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>), a substantial and scientifically rigorous body of knowledge based on large-scale field validation of the purported merits of biochar has not yet been generated. Based on a meta-analysis of the effects of biochar-application on crop yields, Jeffery et al. (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) concluded that: “while biochar has been shown to have promise for increasing crop productivity, we do not have a mechanistic understanding of the interactions behind observed yield increases to provide universally applicable guidance.” In another meta-analysis, Jeffery et al. (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>) reported that the extent and cause of the assumed yield benefit of biochar use was controversial, and that the yield benefits were from nutrient-poor, acidic, tropical soils when high-nutrient biochar inputs were added. The authors also cautioned that the lack of uniformity in the available literature on biochar effects on crop yield could impact the statistical rigor of such meta-analyses.
