<p class="p">Several studies have reported that biochar addition to soils decreases soil bulk density (BD) and increases water-holding capacity (WHC). Increase in WHC following biochar addition is attributed to high surface area and porosity of biochar (Novak et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>; Kinney et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>; Laghari et al., 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), which contributes to greater water use efficiency and thus plant productivity. Increase in WHC by biochar additions could be particularly pronounced in sandy soils, where the low surface area of their particles and abundance of macro-pores limit the capacity for holding water. Based on studies using pine-sawdust biochar produced under different temperatures, Laghari et al. (
