<p class="p">Nutrient retention/loss risk during biochar application depends not only on the nutrient release potential of the biochar, but also the nutrient retention properties of the soil. Dari et al. (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) showed that P retention in non-calcareous soils is a property of the soil, independent of the nature of the feedstock. Therefore, the biochar from the same source added at a given rate to different soils could have different effects based on the respective soil properties. As in the case of inorganic P additions, any P released by a given biochar will be retained by the soil as long as the threshold P saturation ratio of the non-calcareous soil is not exceeded (Nair V. D., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, when the same amount of biochar is added to a sandy soil and a more clayey soil, the sandy soil will begin to release P faster than the clayey soil. The temperature at which biochar is produced may not have any effect on P release property of the biochar-amended soil (Nair et al., 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>); therefore biochar produced using sophisticated techniques or in simple kilns would likely behave similarly on a given soil type.
