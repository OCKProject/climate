<p class="p">Increasing biomass production, whether for increasing food production, energy generation or for reclaiming degraded land, will remove atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and could thus be a mitigating strategy for reducing global warming. Moreover, conversion of agriculture and forestry byproducts into biochar could reduce CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and methane emissions from feedstocks during the natural decomposition or burning of the waste material (

Overall, it seems reasonable to conclude that biochar's effect on climate change mitigation cannot be established as a causeâ€”effect relationship; but there could be advantages in the longer term.
