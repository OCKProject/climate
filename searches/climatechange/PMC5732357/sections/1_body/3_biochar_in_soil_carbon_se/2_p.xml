<p class="p">One of the important attributes of biochar is that carbon in biochar resists decomposition. Lehmann et al. (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported that biochar “can hold carbon in soils for hundreds to thousands of years” as evidenced by the 
 <italic class="italic">Terra Preta</italic> soils of the Amazonian region in Northern Brazil (Glaser et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). A meta-analysis of decomposition and priming effects on biochar stability in soil (Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) suggested that only a small percentage of biochar C (3%) is bioavailable and that the remaining contributed to long-term stability in soil. The analysis was based on 128 observations of biochar-derived CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from 24 studies with 
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C and radioactive 
 <sup class="sup">14</sup>C isotopes. However, a systematic review by Gurwick et al. (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) concluded that: “there are not enough data to draw conclusions about how biochar production and application affect whole-system GHS (greenhouse gas) budgets.”
