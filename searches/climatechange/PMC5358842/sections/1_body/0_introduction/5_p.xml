<p class="p">One study assessed a national sample of 269 New Zealanders’ responses on climate-related questions three times over a one-year period [
 <xref rid="pone.0174246.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], reporting that concern about global warming and climate change did not increase over this duration—perhaps due to the limited time frame—but that higher levels of climate-related knowledge increased climate change concern, which in turn translated into greater subjective environmental responsibility. Another study assessed a nationally representative sample of US citizens about climate belief and personal experience of climate and weather, assessed in 2008 and 2011 [
 <xref rid="pone.0174246.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Results showed that personal experience of climate change-affected weather increased climate change belief and certainty, but also that high certainty also predicted subjective experience—strong climate change skeptics and believers tended to interpret subjective weather experience consistent with their belief.
