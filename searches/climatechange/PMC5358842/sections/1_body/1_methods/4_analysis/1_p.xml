<p class="p">We simultaneously examined respondentsâ€™ level of agreement to both climate change beliefs across time using a parallel process Latent Growth Model. This technique has many advantages when compared to other longitudinal data-analytic techniques [
 <xref rid="pone.0174246.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Some of the advantages include the ability to estimate reference levels (or initial amount; 
 <italic class="italic">intercept</italic>) and their developmental trajectories to and from those levels (
 <italic class="italic">slope</italic>); the ability to estimate change in latent variables as the technique is a special case of structural equation modeling; the ability to estimate means, variances and covariances of individuals differences in both intercepts and slopes; and the technique does not assume that all individuals in a particular longitudinal project change over time at the same rate.
