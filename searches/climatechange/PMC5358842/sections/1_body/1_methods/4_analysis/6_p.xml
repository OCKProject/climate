<p class="p">In this regression equation, 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 </sub> is the predicted level of climate belief in the given question at time 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic> is the intercept, or model-predicted mean level of belief when 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 0 (i.e., 30th June, 2009), 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> is the fixed effect for the linear growth component of the model, and 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup> is the fixed effect for the quadratic growth component. Values of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> are distributed in this model so that 1.0 unit represents a change of one year. We used the parameters reported in 
 <xref rid="pone.0174246.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> to derive model-implied levels of disagreement-agreement that “climate change is real” and “climate change is caused by humans” for values of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> ranging from .25 (October 2009) to 6.25 (October 2015) in quarterly increments.
