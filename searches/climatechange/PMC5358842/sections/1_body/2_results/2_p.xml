<p class="p">What about change in the climate change beliefs over time? 
 <xref rid="pone.0174246.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> presents the results from the parallel process Latent Growth Model predicting change in disagreement to agreement in response to the climate change belief items. We first tested a linear growth model, and then extended this to include a second-order polynomial (quadratic) growth component. The quadratic growth component in the quadratic model was significant, and thus we focus on this model as it allowed for potential change occurring in a simple accelerating (or decelerating) fashion.
