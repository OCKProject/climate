<p class="p">Our study is the first large-scale quantitative attempt to assess the impact of climate change on health of the vulnerable communities in Bangladesh (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). Similar studies have been conducted in Philippines (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>), Vietnam (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>), the United States of America, Canada, Malta (

 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), Australia (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>), and China (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>), although their main focus was on people's perception about the impact of climate change on health. A cross-sectional study of two villages in Bangladesh had some limitations with regard to generalizability but their findings on climate-related health coping supports some of the findings of our study (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>). The average total health expenditure was more in our study (6,555 BDT) when compared with the study by Haque et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>) (2,250 BDT). Our sample size was larger, representative, and geographically more well-distributed among vulnerable communities when compared with studies in other developing countries, such as Nepal and Trinidad and Tobago (
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). This survey revealed that the vulnerable community believes that the climate is changing with an effect on human health in Bangladesh. This information is supported by the BMD data from 1951 to 2011, SAARC Meteorological Research Centre (SMRC), and other studies (
