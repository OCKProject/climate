<p class="p">There are several ways through which FD patterns may be affected by historical climatic conditions such as the late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial climatic oscillations. First, historical climatic conditions might filter out physiologically or ecologically unsuitable species from either the local assemblage or the metacommunity species pool based on their functional attributes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, resulting in local functional assemblages not representing the full array of viable attributes given current environmental conditions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Third, changes in diversification rates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> might modify the regional assemblage of functional traits via environmentally driven selection, resulting in the emergence of new attribute states or combinations. Hence, past climatic changes such as glacial-interglacial climatic oscillations have the potential to impose lasting effects on diversity patterns. Specifically, past climatic changes have the potential to determine the size and structure of the locally realized functional trait space from the expectation under the current environmental conditions
