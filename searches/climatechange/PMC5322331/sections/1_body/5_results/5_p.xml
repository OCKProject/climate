<p class="p">For a more comprehensive assessment of the relative importance of each of the evaluated predictors across evaluated orders, Akaike weights (W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub>) were used to determine which predictors had the highest support as explanatory factors of F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub>. For this purpose, starting with a pool of 576 possible SAR models for each one of the evaluated orders, the W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub> values for all the models including the predictor of interest were added (see 
 <italic class="italic">Methods</italic> for details). The evaluated models described all non-interacting linear and unimodal (linear + quadratic responses) combinations of historical and contemporary predictors. Across evaluated orders, contemporary predictors had higher relative importance (highest W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub>) when compared to historical predictors (

 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> included mean annual temperature and topographic heterogeneity, closely followed by annual precipitation and NDVI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In the F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> case, mean annual temperature and annual precipitation were the variables with W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub> values consistently above 70% (
