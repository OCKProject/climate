<p class="p">The explained variance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> top) and shape of the relation of FD with evaluated environmental predictors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figs 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5</xref>) showed a wide variability across evaluated orders. Nonetheless, some generalities emerge regarding the main drivers of F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> change in the region. Overall, mean annual temperature and topographic variability were the predictors with the highest explained variance for both F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub>. Furthermore, F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>) increased with mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, and productivity. However, the explained variance of single-predictor models (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> top) shows that for almost all the evaluated orders, variability in F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> was also strongly related to at least one of two historical variables: late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial temperature velocity and accessibility to glacial refugia. The observed directionality of associations with historical climate aligned with our expectations of the effects of historical variables on functional diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figs 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5</xref>). Specifically, F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> decreased as temperature velocities increase (high instability), and increased with proximity to refugia (greater accessibility to post-glacial recolonization).
