<p class="p">Dutilleul’s corrected correlation tests indicate a positive association between F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> ranging between 0.46 and 0.64 across orders, and p &lt; 0.05 in al cases). Association with species richness was significant for F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> ranging between 0.67 and 0.9 across orders, and p &lt; 0.05 in al cases), and non-significant for F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> ranging between 0.1 and 0.34 across orders, and p ≥ 0.05 in al cases). Although there is a strong relationship between F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and local species richness, observed values consistently differ from those expected solely on species richness, and these relationships quickly saturate as the number of species increases (as described in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary material</xref>). These results demonstrate that local F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> consistently deviates from expectations based on taxon richness alone, particularly in areas with high species richness.
