<p class="p">Model average regression coefficients for the evaluated ordersâ€™ SAR regressions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Tables 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">2</xref>) provide further support for the general importance of historical climate, either in the form of temperature stability or accessibility, as a key determinant of the FD. Magnitudes of averaged standardized coefficient show significant effects on FD of both historical and contemporary factors in all the evaluated orders (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Similarly, accessibility, mean annual temperature, and annual precipitation were particularly influential in shaping observed F
