<p class="p">The two historical predictors that consistently showed importance scores comparable to those of contemporary predictors were temperature velocity and postglacial accessibility (

 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> or F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub>. As indicated by the W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub> scores, the importance of precipitation velocity is relatively lower, as it ranged across evaluated orders between 1% and 30% for F
