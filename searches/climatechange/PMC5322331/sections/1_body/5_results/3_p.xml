<p class="p">No single trait was the sole determinant of the observed FD patterns, as indicated by spatial models evaluating the association between range and variability of evaluated traits with F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> respectively (as described in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary information</xref>). Nonetheless, single and multiple regressions between FD and trait richness and dispersion show that canopy height and seed weight, which are both related to dispersal capacity, exhibit the strongest associations with F
