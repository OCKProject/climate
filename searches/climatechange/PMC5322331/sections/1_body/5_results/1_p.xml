<p class="p">Using multi-trait metrics, we estimated the geographic patterns in F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> for species assemblages from six orders of European angiosperms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). As expected, F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> per-grid values differed among orders, a pattern confirmed by the significant better fit of a random intercept model when compared to a model without a random effect (p &lt; 0.001 for both F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> Log-likelihood ratio tests). Regardless of the differences in F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> per-grid values across the evaluated orders, and in agreement with our hypotheses, spatial patterns, and latitudinal gradients were consistent across orders (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2</xref>). F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> increased from Southern to Central Europe and decreased from Central to Northern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2a</xref>). F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> maximum values were recorded across Central Europe, notably coinciding with the southern band of mountainous areas (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> decreased in a south-to-north direction (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">2b</xref>), but with high-values in both the Italian and Balkan peninsulas, and northern Sweden and Finland.
