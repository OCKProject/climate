<p class="p">Five ecomorphological traits were used to describe the functional space defined by coexisting species of the same order. Used traits are specific leaf area (SLA, cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>*g
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), maximum stem height (H
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, m), seed mass (SWT, mg), stem specific density (WD, kg*m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>), and growth form (aquatic, herb, graminoid, shrub, tree, or vine). These traits were selected due to their usefulness for distinguishing functional strategies among concurring plants

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>, the known link between these traits and abiotic environments
