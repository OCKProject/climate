<p class="p">For each order, the relative support of each predictor in isolation was determined based on model fits of single-predictor models, and information theoretical approaches based on multiple- predictor models. The variance explained by each historical and contemporary predictor in isolation was assessed based on the model fit of single-predictor SAR models, determined using Nagelkerke pseudo-R

Last, the relative effect of historical and contemporary predictors was determined using the model averaged regression coefficients
