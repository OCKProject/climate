<p class="p">Plant species distribution data for this study comes from the Atlas Florae Europaeae (AFE), which maps the distribution of European flora on an equal-area mapping unit of ~50 × 50 km (AFE cells
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>) based on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and Military Grid Reference System (MGRS). Observations for the former Soviet Union were not included in the analyses due to uncertainties in the records for this area. Selected AFE grid cells were the geographic units for all the computations and analyses done in this study.
