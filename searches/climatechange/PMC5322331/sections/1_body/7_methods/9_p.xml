<p class="p">A spatial simultaneous autoregressive error modelling approach (SAR) was used to account for spatial autocorrelation in the data. In all cases, FD was the response variable, and environmental predictors (linear or unimodal responses) were used as explanatory variables. The spatial weights matrices in the SAR models were determined as the first neighbour of each site.</p>
