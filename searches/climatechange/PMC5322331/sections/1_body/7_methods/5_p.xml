<p class="p">For each order and imputed dataset, two complementary FD metrics were estimated: functional richness (F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub>) and functional dispersion (F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub>). The selected metrics describe two aspects of a species assemblage multivariate trait composition. F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> measures the size of the functional space circumscribed by the species in an assemblage based on the volume of a multivariate convex hull
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> measures the packing of the functional space described by the species in an assemblage based on the distance to the mean trait composition of the community
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. The FD metrics were evaluated using continuous traits (SLA, H
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, SWT, and WD). Before the analyses, traits were log
 <sub class="sub">10</sub> transformed as they were log-normally distributed and standardized (mean = 0 and SD = 1) to ensure that all traits contribute equally and that the units used to measure traits have no influence on the FD estimation
