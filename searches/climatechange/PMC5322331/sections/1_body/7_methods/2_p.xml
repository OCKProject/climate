<p class="p">Analyses in this study focus on the distributions of six of the most species-rich, widely distributed, and functionally distinct Angiosperm orders contained in the AFE: Caryophyllales (1384spp), Brassicales (973spp), Ranunculales (654spp), Saxifragales (352spp), Rosales (334spp) and Malpighiales (73spp). The use of orders as independent units of analysis provides the benefit of replicability among groups with an independent evolutionary history, which would translate to their trait values and composition. As a result, any similarity in the observed geographic trends and the effects of contemporary and historical environmental conditions on the regional functional diversity (FD) patterns can be attributed to the similarity in the mechanisms generating the observed pattern across multiple groups, and not to the taxonomic composition of the evaluated species pool. The regional coverage and species richness for each order are presented as
