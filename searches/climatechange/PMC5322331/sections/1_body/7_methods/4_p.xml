<p class="p">Mean trait values were initially determined based on multiple trait databases, described in the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>), using a dataset that covers all the species with known traits in the AFE. The MICE approach has been shown to provide accurate trait estimates and conserves allometric relations when up to 60% of data is missing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. On average, between 40 and 50% of the evaluated species required the imputation of a trait. The imputation procedure starts with an observed, incomplete data set for which a multivariate distribution for the attribute of interest is defined based on the available information, and then used to drawing an imputation of the missing values using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Multiple imputed values are generated for each empty case (ten in total), by randomly selecting values for the missing observation from a simulated trait space.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. Since this approach produced ten different trait estimates for each gap in the database, the estimation of functional diversity and regressions analyses used each of the imputed replicates independently to account for the uncertainty in the trait imputation procedure. Mean trait values per AFE grid for all four continuous traits are presented as
