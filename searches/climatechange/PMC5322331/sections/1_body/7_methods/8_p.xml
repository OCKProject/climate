 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref> and included the mean annual temperature, total annual precipitation (mm × year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, unitless) was obtained from ref.
