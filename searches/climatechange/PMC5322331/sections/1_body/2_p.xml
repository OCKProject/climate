<p class="p">The underlying idea of this study is that long-term climate dynamics may have affected in a similar way the functional diversity of multiple phylogenetically independent components of the European flora. The working hypotheses of this study are: (1) Geographical patterns in functional diversity will be consistent across phylogenetically independent functional groups; (2) the effects of historical climate change over the last 21,000 years as an important co-determinant of functional richness (F

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>) and functional dispersion (F

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>) should be seen consistently across phylogenetically independent groups. The reasoning behind this hypothesis is that climatically stable and suitable conditions promote a wider coverage of the viable trait space

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. In contrast, areas that have experienced long-term patterns of climatic instability and were climatically unavailable during the Last-Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~21,000 years ago), would more likely experience a non-random removal of functional combinations (e.g., cold-sensitive species). Such conditions would increase the functional differences between surviving and immigrating species, resulting in smaller and scattered functional spaces.
