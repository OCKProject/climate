<p class="p">The results presented here show that macro-scale, functional diversity geographic patterns for multiple European plant groups were indeed associated with late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change even though the end of the last glaciation occurred ~11,500 years ago. These results indicate that future climate change trends may elicit not only short-term shifts in ecosystem functioning, and potentially long-term functional disequilibria. Consequently, understanding the impact and generality of these historically determined patterns acting in conjunction with contemporary environmental conditions is paramount to developing, particularly for the development of accurate predictive methods for ecosystem function and service responses to future climatic changes.</p>
