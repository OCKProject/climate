<p class="p">The directions of the association between F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> and historical conditions were consistent with the predictions of a higher F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and a lower F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> in areas with stable climatic conditions and proximity to glacial refugia. The consistency in the reported associations and the current knowledge of the vegetation history of this region provide some indications of how the observed influence of historical factors might be the result of multiple interacting mechanisms. Such mechanisms include dispersal-limited recolonization dynamics in climatically suitable areas
