<p class="p">The reported relationships between geographic patterns of European plant F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> and historical climatic conditions show that the constraints imposed by late-Quaternary glacial-interglacial climate change on species current ranges also influence the FD geographic patterns observable today. Moreover, these historical effects constitute a general trend across multiple evolutionary independent groups of European plants. Nonetheless, the subtle differences in the geographic patterns observed across the evaluated orders may be attributable to the spatial variability in historical species sorting by glacial-interglacial climate changes. Other possible factors driving the observed differences between groups are differences in dispersal capacity across groups of organisms
