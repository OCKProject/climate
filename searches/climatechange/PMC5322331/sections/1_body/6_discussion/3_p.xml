<p class="p">The continental-level assessment of historical climatic effects on European F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> presented here showed the generality of the strong complementary effects of historical and contemporary drivers. The fact that such effects were consistent across all six evaluated orders highlights their joint importance in determining regional F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> patterns, even across evolutionally independent lineages. Support for the importance of historical factors as determinants of contemporary FD comes from the fit of regression models (pseudoâ€“R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), the comparable support of contemporary and historical predictors (W
 <sub class="sub">AIC</sub>), and the size of SAR model averaged regression coefficients across evaluated orders.
