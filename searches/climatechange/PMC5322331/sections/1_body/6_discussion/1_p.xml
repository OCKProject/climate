<p class="p">This study determined the FD geographic patterns of multiple phylogenetically independent groups of European plants by combining species distribution data and trait information. The relations of these geographic patterns with multiple environmental predictors show that historical climates and contemporary environments shape the FD patterns of European plants. The strong association of contemporary F
