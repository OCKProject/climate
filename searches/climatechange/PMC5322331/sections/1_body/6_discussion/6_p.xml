<p class="p">The historical effects on F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> are consistent with the tendency for past climatic conditions to prune trait spaces via mechanisms altering the number and types of organisms within a location (such as non-random extinctions or re-colonization
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref> and dispersal lags
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>). Similarly, F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> is mainly positively associated with postglacial accessibility, which again may reflect how both the non-random pruning of the functional space based on attributes related to dispersal ability, the existence of multiple viable trait combinations under mesic conditions, and a homogenization of the spacing among surviving or re-immigrated species from refugia areas. As a result, current FD values of evaluated orders can be considered to be in disequilibrium with contemporary climate; a result aligned with the reported disequilibrium in other diversity components in Europe
