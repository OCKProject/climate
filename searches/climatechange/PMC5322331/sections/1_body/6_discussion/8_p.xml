<p class="p">The results presented here provide four strong arguments supporting the relevance of historical climatic legacies as determinants of FD patterns across multiple evolutionary independent groups of European angiosperms: (1) The inability of both multiple and individual trait models solely based on contemporary climates to account for most of the variation in F
