<p class="p">In summary, this study shows that historical climate stability and distance to refuge locations influence the geographic distribution of FD in multiple evolutionary independent European plant groups. The results thereby also indicate that local F

Moreover, the results of this study suggest that future climate change will not only elicit short-term shifts in ecosystem functioning but likely will also induce long-lasting ecosystem level effects, strengthened by long-term functional disequilibria. The underlying mechanisms behind such historical effects need to be evaluated in more detail, notably to facilitate incorporating them into predictive models of future dynamics of vegetation and related ecosystem functioning to enhance the accuracy of climate-change impact and dynamics estimations.
