<p class="p">The influence of the contemporary environment on FD illustrates the known effect of recent environmental conditions as key determinants of species distribution and richness patterns among plants in Europe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>. As expected, contemporary mild climates, high levels of productivity, and large topographic heterogeneity exhibited positive effects on F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub>. However, the strength of these effects varied between evaluated orders and evaluated aspects of the functional space. The relation between F
 <sub class="sub">Rich</sub> and both mean annual temperature and topographic heterogeneity shows how contemporary environmental conditions can determine the possible functional space size that an assembly can occupy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Similarly, the relationship of F
 <sub class="sub">Disp</sub> to mean annual temperature and annual precipitation are consistent with the tendency of areas with suitable and productive climates to show evenly packed functional spaces. Such conditions reduce the strength of environmental filtering
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>, allowing both functionally distinct species with similar habitat requirements and functionally similar species with different habitat requirements to coexist within a region, e.g., via small-scale habitat partitioning.
