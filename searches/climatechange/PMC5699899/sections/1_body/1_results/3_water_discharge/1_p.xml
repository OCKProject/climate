 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), fed by Mount Hermon (fig. S8), have been reconstructed in an attempt to detect correlations with urban development. Two main phases of low water level (~2150 to 1950 BCE and ~1050 to 840 BCE; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) are chronologically correlated with a steep decline in settlement intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>). For the period 1950 to 1050 BCE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>), the surroundings of the site appear to have been completely covered by water, at least during the seeding and growing seasons. The water-table level was probably sufficiently high for successful agricultural development (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>). Conversely, the period ~840 to 300 BCE shows large variations in water inputs, with a gradual decline initiated at ~700 BCE and peaking at ~350 BCE, most probably affecting the population since ~650 BCE. This period of decline is also marked by increases in pasturing, whereas agricultural indicators dropped below the Bronze Age scores (fig. S7). The water level during the last recorded period (~300 to ~90 BCE) increases but remains around the median values. The wavelet analyses for the water level and discharges show a 550-year periodicity, similar to the one recorded by the PCA-Axis1 (fig. S6). A positive correlation centered on a null lag (Lag

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.05; fig. S3C) also indicates that water variability is linked to ecosystem dynamics.
