<p class="p">Variations in PCA-Axis1 scores, loaded by water-fed vegetation clusters (positive values) and drought-resistant assemblages (negative scores), reflect ecological changes (fig. S2) resulting from periodic variations in water availability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref> and fig. S1). The major shifts observed in ecosystem dynamics—trophic downgrading, community decline, and loss of ecosystem services—result from lower water inputs from Mount Hermon at ~2150 to 1950 BCE, ~1050 to 840 BCE, and ~550 to 350 BCE (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). The area was never dry, but probably evolved into a marsh zone, suggesting changes in water supply dynamics and disruptions in the water distribution network around the city. In the Iron Age IB to Iron Age IIA, the ecological shift in Upper Galilee also correlates with the driest phase in Egypt (

 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">45</italic>
 </xref>) driven by a decline in freshwater supplies, a finding that is underlined by both spectral (white noise) and REDFIT (red noise) analyses. The 550-year pacemaker seems to be an intermediary cycle that may be a derived mode stemming from a rectification of the signal generated by a superposition of the fundamental solar modes (

 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">47</italic>
 </xref>). This intermediary cycle could also be a manifestation of the rectified responses of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation to external solar modulation and pacing (

  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
 </xref>). Changes in water supply in the ancient Upper Galilee therefore seem to be mediated by an internal threshold response of the global thermohaline circulation to solar forcing.
