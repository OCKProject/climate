<p class="p">We created a settlement intensity curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>) by combining two parameters, “settlement density” and “estimated settled area,” to assess whether ecological shifts, resulting from changes in freshwater supply from Mount Hermon and the Golan, may have affected urban development (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The impact of water supply on agricultural practices and human behavior (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>) was evaluated by tracing signs of traditional Mediterranean oleiculture around Tel Dan. Other cultivated species (cereals, vine, and walnut) and pastoral activities largely mirror the relative intensity of the olive (fig. S7).
