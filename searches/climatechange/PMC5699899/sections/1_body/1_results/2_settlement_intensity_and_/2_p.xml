 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). This correlation suggests that water supply fluctuation affected settlement density in some way, directly or indirectly. In arid regions (for example, in large parts of Syria and Turkey), the competition for increasingly scarce resources probably led to emigration toward fertile zones like Tel Dan, creating social tensions. Parts of the local population suffering from various forms of predation eventually fled the city, transforming the urban center into a low-density village (
