Laish appears in written documents from the city of Mari (Tell Hariri, Syria), located in the middle of the Euphrates trade routes, and in the Egyptian Execration texts (listing enemies of the Pharaoh), both apparently dating to the 18th century BCE (

The city of Dan was destroyed by an earthquake in the mid-8th century BCE, perhaps the “great noise” mentioned in the book of Amos (1:1), which would date to 762 BCE. The site was again partially destroyed in the second half of the 8th century BCE, perhaps by Tiglath-Pileser III (2 Kings 15:29), king of Assyria. Tel Dan appears to have lost much of its grandeur and cultic importance from the Persian period onward (
