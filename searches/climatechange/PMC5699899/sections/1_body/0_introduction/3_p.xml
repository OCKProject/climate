<p class="p">Located at the edge of one of the most urbanized marsh areas in the Levant, the biblical city of Dan (Tell el-Qadi, “Mound of the Judge” in Arabic; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) is mentioned more than 60 times in the Hebrew Scriptures (for example, Judges 18:29; 20:1). The term “from Dan to Beersheba” was a stock phrase depicting the borders of the Land of Israel. Currently, the site of Tel Dan rests amid a tangle of lush greenery that emerges from the drylands of the northern Hula Valley and the Golan Heights. The ancient city lies at the source of the Dan water system, the main tributary of the Jordan River, Israel, and Jordan’s primary freshwater resource, depicted in the Hebrew Bible as a fount of fertility, its valley watered like the “garden of the Lord” (Genesis 13:10). The Dan stream (annual average flow of 2.6 × l0
 <sup class="sup">8</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) is fed by dozens of springs originating mainly in the rain- and snowfall that precipitate on Mount Hermon (2814 m; 2760 m above Lake Hula). The spring’s discharge is known for both its annual and interannual stability (

 <sup class="sup">3</sup> m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>), descending from Mount Hermon, which further contributed fresh water to the valley below. These sources have sustained human societies and urban development at Tel Dan, with a rich agricultural base since the Late Neolithic period, 7000 years ago. We have no written historical sources that recount the role of water and the impact of regional shortages at ancient Dan; however, evidence from Syria, Mesopotamia, and the southern Levant suggests that drought and changing climate patterns nurtured or hastened violent confrontation, abandonment of rain-fed plains, and migrations (
