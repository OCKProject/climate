<p class="p">Samples from core TD-1 were prepared for pollen analysis using the standard procedure for clay samples. Pollen frequencies (expressed as percentages) are based on the terrestrial pollen sum, excluding local hygrophytes and spores of nonvascular cryptogams. Aquatic taxa frequencies were calculated by adding the local hygrophytes-hydrophytes to the terrestrial pollen sum.</p>
