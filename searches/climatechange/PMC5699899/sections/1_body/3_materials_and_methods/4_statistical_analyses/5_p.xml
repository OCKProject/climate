<p class="p">A surface water curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3D</xref>) was created by adding the clusters “flood plain” and “fluvial bed” (fig. S1) and represented in the same manner as the other curves (LOESS, sinusoidal regression, and boxplot). The river discharge curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) was then generated by correcting the surface water with the variability of drought-resistant ecosystems. A square root was applied to the resulting signal, and the “subtract mean” function was calculated. The outcome is displayed with a sinusoidal regression and a boxplot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The periodicity of the river discharge curve (fig. S6B) and the surface water curve (fig. S6C) was examined using a wavelet analysis with Morlet as the basis function.
