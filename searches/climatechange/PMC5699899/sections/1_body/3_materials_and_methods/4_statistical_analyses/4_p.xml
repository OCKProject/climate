<p class="p">The settlement intensity curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>) and the oleiculture scores (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3C</xref>) are also shown as LOESS smoothing (with bootstrap and smooth 0.05), with the outcomes of the sinusoidal regression (phase Free), and plotted on a linear age-scale. For each curve, a boxplot was also added to show the natural variability from the extreme scores.
