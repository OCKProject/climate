<p class="p">Periodicity was investigated using a sinusoidal regression (phase Free; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>) to show the long-term trends and further examined using a wavelet analysis (wavelet transform) with Morlet as the basis function (fig. S6A). The scalograms are displayed as periods (log
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scale) against a linear age-scale. A spectral analysis was then computed to consider the periodicity in terms of frequency/power (fig. S6A). A REDFIT analysis was added to reduce the red noise (oversampling, 1; segments, 1; and window, rectangular; fig. S6A). The potential effect of the residual on the periodicity was tested using autoregressive-moving average analysis and autocorrelation (95% confidence).
