<p class="p">The relationships between clusters, the PCA-Axis1, agriculture, and the surface water were analyzed using cross-correlations (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.05). The cross-correlations assess the time alignment of two time series by means of the correlation coefficient. The series have been cross-correlated to ascertain the best temporal match and the potential lag between two selected variables. The correlation coefficient was then plotted as a function of the alignment position (fig. S3). Positive and negative correlation coefficients were considered, focusing on the Lag
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> value (with +0.50 and âˆ’0.50 as significant thresholds).
