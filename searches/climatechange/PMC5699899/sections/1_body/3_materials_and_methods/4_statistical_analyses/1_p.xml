<p class="p">All archaeological and botanical data were analyzed using the software package PAST version 2.17c. A regular interpolation (20 years) was first applied to the entire data set. Pollen data were investigated using cluster analysis (paired group as algorithm and correlation as similarity measure; fig. S1). Cluster analysis (descending type) was used to compute the lengths of tree branches, using branches as ecological distances between groups of taxa. Neighbor joining, an alternative process for hierarchical cluster analysis, was also calculated for the hygrophilous-hydrophilous components, using correlation as similarity measure and final branch as root (fig. S1). Each cluster was summed to create pollen-derived vegetation patterns.</p>
