This outcome was witnessed in modern Syria during the 3-year drought in 2007 to 2010, which resulted in widespread crop failure and a mass migration of farming communities to urban areas (

In the same way, during phases of enduring drought in the area of Tel Dan (~2150 to 1950 BCE, ~1050 to 840 BCE, and ~550 to 350 BCE), the adaptive societal structures appear to have become extremely fragile. Abandonment of rain-fed plains and habitat tracking across hydrologically varied landscapes (riparian, paludal, and karstic refugia) were the only resilient strategies for people who sought refuge zones (

  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>). The migration toward river banks and karst-fed spring zones, such as the fertile area of Tel Dan, created rivalry for resources, tensions between groups, and, finally, the semi-abandonment of the city (
