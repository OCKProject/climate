<p class="p">To evaluate if the current extent of protected areas in Australia captures the full range distribution of this gecko species under climate change, we overlaid the current and future potential range distribution with a shapefile of currently protected area network in Australia downloaded from the Collaborative Australian Protected Areas Database (CAPAD 2014). This database provides spatial information about government, indigenous, private and jointly managed protected areas for the Australian continent and also meets the criteria for defining protected areas according to the IUCN standards. This analysis was performed using ArcGIS version 10.3 software.</p>
