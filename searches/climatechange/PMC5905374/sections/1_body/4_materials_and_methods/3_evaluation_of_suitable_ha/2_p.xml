<p class="p">ENM outputs followed a logistic distribution, ranging from 0 (climatically unsuitable areas) to 1 (climatically suitable areas). For all model runs, we quantified the difference in geographical range extent of projected distributions between current and future climate scenarios, in which the extent of potential ranges could be determined by negative values (indicating a net reduction in climatically suitable areas with climate change) or positive values (indicating a net expansion of climatically suitable areas with climate change). We explored potential bioclimatic variables that might be driving range change for our study species by running a regression of change in predicted climate suitability against change in each bioclimatic variable, in turn.</p>
