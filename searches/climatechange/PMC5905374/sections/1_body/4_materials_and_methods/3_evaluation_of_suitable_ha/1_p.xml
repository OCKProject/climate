<p class="p">We applied an ENM approach that relies on presence of species and background data to generate correlative models for both current and future habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">A. lesueurii</italic> species. We used MaxEnt version 3.3.3 (
 <xref rid="zox021-B201" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips et al. 2006</xref>) as it outperforms similar modeling algorithms [but see also 
 <xref rid="zox021-B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al. (2006)</xref> for some of its numerous advantages]. We used 70% of our occurrence data for model training while withholding the remaining 30% for model evaluation. Although we lacked actual absence data for this study species, background or pseudo-absence data was generated assuming 1.5 times the number of presence points, which characterizes the environmental conditions of the study area (

 <xref rid="zox021-B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bezeng et al. 2017</xref>). Model performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) statistics. We then ran 15 subsampling replicates employing 5,000 iterations for each model. These replicates and iterations were considered sufficient for model convergence. Finally, to reduce model extrapolation errors caused by non-analogous climatic conditions (see 
 <xref rid="zox021-B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fitzpatrick and Hargrove 2009</xref>), we used a multivariate environmental similarity surface (MESS) analysis to restrict model projections to analogous environments where true presence and background records were sampled (see also
