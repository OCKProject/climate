<p class="p">Over the past century, global temperatures has increased by ∼0.74 °C, and one of the most important bioclimatic effects seems to be an increase in the mean surface temperature (

Therefore, assessing species’ responses to climate change is one of the greatest challenges that conservation biologists face. Notwithstanding, the effects of raising temperatures have been felt from species to community levels (
