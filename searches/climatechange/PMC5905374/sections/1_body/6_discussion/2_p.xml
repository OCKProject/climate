<p class="p">In this study, we used an environmental niche modeling approach as implemented in the MaxEnt algorithm since this method is especially good in handling species with few occurrences (

Our results demonstrate that, climate change projections for the year 2075 have the potential to alter the distribution of the velvet gecko in southeastern Australia. Specifically, climate change may favor the range expansion of this species to encompass more suitable habitats. However, the magnitude of the effects of warming on the velvet gecko and on reptiles in general will depend on physiological and/or behavioural plasticity or evolutionary adaptations of different species (

 <xref rid="zox021-B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Monasterio et al. 2013</xref>). Therefore, as a potential source of resilience, ectotherms like the velvet gecko have 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> capabilities to deal with extreme climates (see also 
 <xref rid="zox021-B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sunday et al. 2014</xref>). For example, this species inhabits closed systems (i.e., loose surface rocks), but in most rocky flat forms there are few loose surface rocks for animals to settle under. As a result, adult lizards may experience higher temperature during the summer. Additionally, over the last 25 years, female velvet geckos at our study sites near Nowra have continuously used the same communal nest sites for oviposition, suggesting rather limited plasticity in their choice of nest sites. Therefore, as a survival strategy, this species must leave these sites but employing this strategy is not possible. Thus, to prevent overheating, the geckos will need to move between hotter and cooler surfaces more often, potentially exposing them to avian predators and lowering their chances of survival. Notwithstanding, projecting future distributions under 3 RCPs, we identified suitable climate refugia where this species is likely to occupy. This includes southeastern New South Wales particularly toward the Australian Capital Territory. We found that similar temperature and precipitation bioclimatic variables were important in driving range change for 
 <italic class="italic">A. lesueurii</italic> in southeast Australia. Additionally, we revealed some mismatches in the potential area of overlap in the range distribution of this gecko species currently and in the future with the network of protected areas in southeastern Australia.
