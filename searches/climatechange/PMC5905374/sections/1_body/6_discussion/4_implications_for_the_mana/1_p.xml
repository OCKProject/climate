<p class="p">The velvet gecko is a nocturnal lizard (
 <xref rid="zox021-B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cogger 2000</xref>), which relies on sandstone rocks for shelter sites, and this habitat is threatened by the illegal removal of “bush rocks” (
 <xref rid="zox021-B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shine et al. 1998</xref>). For example, in Dharawal National Park and Morton National Park, the velvet gecko’s habitats (i.e., rock platforms) are not connected to each other but rather separated by a minimum distance of approximately 2–3 km (

 <xref rid="zox021-B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pike et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, it is highly unlikely that they would shift rocky platforms due to higher temperatures, although shifting habitats (suitable microhabitats) or finding suitable retreat sites represent possible survival mechanisms to avoid lethally high temperatures in the future. In addition, the endangered broad-headed snake
