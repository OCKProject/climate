 <italic class="italic">lesueurii</italic>, together with its range-restricted nature and absence of population data, presents a daunting scenario for its conservation. Furthermore, human activities through the illegal removal of “bush rocks” and constant disturbance by reptile collectors provide a further threat to this species’ survival. This phenomenon is further compounded by increases in air temperatures, which in turn increase their nest temperatures. Thus, the hatchlings survival is significantly affected which might lead to a higher probability of extinction (

If the frequency and duration of summer heat waves increases in the future, coupled with anthropogenic habitat destruction, this may have profound effects on the velvet gecko population. In turn, local extinctions of geckos will have negative consequences for an endangered predator (broad-headed snake) that feeds almost entirely on velvet geckos. These findings have important implications for conservation of both predators and prey. We therefore suggest that the restricted habitat of the velvet gecko currently as predicted by climate should be a focus of intensive pre-emptive management in order to conserve this species from extinction. These results are consistent with previous studies, and in some cases management initiatives are already in place to restore the habitat of this species (see

 <xref rid="zox021-B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). For example, artificial refugia have been constructed to allow crevices where this species can hide from lethal temperatures (
 <xref rid="zox021-B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Croak et al. 2010</xref>). These artificial rocks help to increase the colonization of both adults and juvenile geckos and we suggest that the addition of these artificial refugia should be continued in an effort to conserve this species. This is especially evident in the Dharawal National Park (67 km south of Sydney) and Morton National Park (160 km south of Sydney), which were important habitats for the velvet gecko but heavily degraded by bush-rock collection. Additionally, we show that the current network of protected areas in southeast Australia does not fully account for the full range distribution of this species currently and in the future. Therefore, present conservation actions to protect this species from anthropogenic activities should be increased to encompass the slight increases in suitable habitats of this endemic species in southeastern Australia as shown by this study. All these opportunities should be seized as they represent important conservation measures to protect this range-restricted species from anthropogenic activities.
