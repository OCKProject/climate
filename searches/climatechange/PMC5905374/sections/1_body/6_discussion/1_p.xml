<p class="p">The recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts that human activities are driving global climate change, which is likely to further increase in the future (IPCC, 2014). Thus, many species are expected to shift their current distribution to track future climate change. For example, there are growing evidences documenting the movement of species northward and upward in elevation (

First, the narrow distribution and sample sizes for such species come with an additional challenge for model robustness from a statistical point of view (

Second, the occurrence data for range-restricted species are often sporadic, adding more bias to modeling their potential distribution. Therefore, defining their full extent becomes less reliable from a management perspective as opposed to understanding their habitat occupancy (

Consequently, data consideration for range-restricted species imposes a huge challenge for ENMs because they are meant to identify the full extent of a speciesâ€™ potential distribution but may underestimate this range if data are sporadic or intermittent (
