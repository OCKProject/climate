<p class="p">For reptiles in particular, decline and extirpations of large populations have occurred in many parts of the world, and climate change is one of the leading causal agents postulated to explain these declines (

 <xref rid="zox021-B8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Clusella-Trullas et al. 2011</xref>). This is mainly because, their biology and ecology are closely tied to climate; especially changes in environmental temperature (

 <xref rid="zox021-B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sinervo et al. 2010</xref>). Specifically, several populations of lizards around the globe have been significantly threatened by changing climatic conditions, and recent research has predicted significant declines over the next century (
 <xref rid="zox021-B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sinervo et al. 2010</xref>). This is particularly true for tropical species, which are already living close to their physiological optimum levels (
 <xref rid="zox021-B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Deutsch et al. 2008</xref>). Body temperatures higher than optimum creates physiological stress, reduced performance, and increased disease susceptibility; ultimately leading to population declines and extinction (

 <xref rid="zox021-B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huey et al. 2012</xref>). For example, projected temperature increases of between 1.1 °C and 6.4 °C by the year 2100 would increase the metabolic rates of ectotherms by 10–75% (
 <xref rid="zox021-B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bickford et al. 2010</xref>). A rise in metabolic rates coupled with reduced foraging time could negatively affect reproduction and subsequently population growth rates (

 <xref rid="zox021-B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Logan et al. 2014</xref>). However, the vulnerability of a species depends on its sensitivity to environmental change, its exposure to that change, its resilience or ability to recover, and its potential to adapt to these changes (
 <xref rid="zox021-B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams et al. 2008</xref>). Ideally, to predict species at risk from global warming and climate change, we need information about their habitat selection and colonization ability. For example, species with lower dispersal ability may face difficulties to colonize suitable habitats due to specialized habitat requirements (
 <xref rid="zox021-B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hughes 2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="zox021-B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="zox021-B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araújo et al. 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="zox021-B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huey et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, investigating how reptiles, especially the range-restricted ones, will respond to a new climatic regime is critical if we are to mitigate the impacts of climate change from a conservation point of view.
