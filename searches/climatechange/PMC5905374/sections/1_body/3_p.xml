<p class="p">Lately, researchers have developed tools that enable the evaluation of the potential geographic distribution of a species’ abiotic niche from changing climatic conditions. Of the many different tools available, species ecological niche models (ENMs) have been widely used (

 <xref rid="zox021-B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Melville et al. 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="zox021-B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tingley et al. 2016</xref>). These models relate data on species’ occurrence (i.e., presence/absence) to the bioclimatic conditions of a given area, therefore allowing us to determine the potential climate envelope of a species. In so doing, geographic areas that fall within or outside of the current range distribution of the species could be identified (

For example, mapping where rare and endangered species are most likely to occur in the landscape, species discovery; prioritizing conservation sites; and identifying potential restoration sites, especially after invasion amongst others (

 <xref rid="zox021-B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rebaudo et al. 2016</xref>; and references therein). To contribute to the growing body of knowledge on this topic, we used a range-restricted species

Additionally, we investigate if the current extent of protected area networks in Australia captures the full range distribution of this species currently and in the future.
