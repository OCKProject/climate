<p class="p">Lastly, we evaluated the area of overlap between the current protected area network and the range shift of the velvet gecko in order to determine if the current extent of protected areas in southeast Australia accounts for the range expansion of this species. Surprisingly, we found that the current network of protected areas in southeast Australia does not fully account for the full range distribution of this species currently and in the future. For example, we found that, of the 2,009 protected areas that overlapped with the current distribution of this species, a significant number (i.e., 103) were outside the species’ current range distribution. Likewise, of the 2,099 protected areas that overlapped with the future distribution of this species, 118 of them were outside the species’ future range distribution, representing ∼30% of the species’ future range area (see
