<p class="p">Epidemiologic data have consistently demonstrated that people who have lower incomes, older adults, and black individuals are more vulnerable to extreme heat. This study demonstrates that non-Hispanic black individuals are more likely to lack access to AC, but this disparity is not fully explained by having a lower household income. This, along with the finding that people with low household incomes are more likely to lack access to AC, may partially explain reported disparities in heat-related morbidity and mortality. Further qualitative research is needed to investigate mechanisms for increased risk among non-Hispanic blacks, including other reasons for not owning AC beyond income constraints. As with the 2011 survey, our results underscore the need to continue to help vulnerable individuals purchase AC and run it during very hot weather. This could be done in part by expanding the cooling assistance component of the Home Energy Assistance Program, which currently receives less funding in New York state than the heating assistance component. AC access is a health-equity issue, one likely to become more urgent as our climate continues to warm. Our results also point to opportunities for knowledge building on the serious health consequences of heat and engagement with certain segments of the population on climate change adaptation. Periodic population-based surveys such as this provide insight into progress achieved and opportunities for advancement toward climate and health adaptation goals.</p>
