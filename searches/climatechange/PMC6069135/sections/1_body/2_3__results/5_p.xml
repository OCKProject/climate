<p class="p">We also examined heat-health awareness and behaviors, risk perception, and climate change concern among New Yorkers. A majority of participants reported seeing, hearing, or reading warnings about dangerously hot weather in NYC during the preceding summer (66%, 95% CI: 63, 70), but only 43% (95% CI: 39, 46) reported a belief that on very hot days, the heat inside their home is very likely or somewhat likely to make them ill. In a logistic regression model of race, income, gender, age, and risk perception predicting warning awareness, survey participants with a household income less than $30,000 were almost half as likely to report seeing, hearing, or reading heat warnings in NYC compared to individuals with higher household incomes (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4, 1.0) (

We found that participants with a low household income (OR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.3, 3.0), non-Hispanic blacks (OR = 1.9, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.0), and participants who had seen, heard, or read about heat warnings (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.2, 2.6) were more likely to check in on a family member, friend, or neighbor to make sure they were okay during very hot weather.
