 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Areas with lower prevalence of air conditioning (AC), for example, have been found to have higher rates of heat-related deaths [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], while areas with more green space tend to have lower rates of heat-related deaths [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. At the individual level, older adults, men, and people with chronic physical and mental health issues have greater risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Additionally, in many studies in the US, black individuals have been found to be more vulnerable to heat-related morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This is also true in New York City (NYC), where heat wave deaths were more likely to occur among non-Hispanic black individuals than other race/ethnicities [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, less is known about why this population is at heightened risk.
