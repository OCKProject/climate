<p class="p">In both 2011 and 2015, high proportions of residents reported staying home during very hot weather, even if they could not keep their home cool. In the 2015 survey we elicited more information about this behavior, finding that while low risk perception remained the most frequently reported reason for staying home, it was closely followed by a strong general personal preference (a volunteered response that was recorded, rather than a response option) and then by a specific preference not to spend time with strangers. These results point to the importance of (1) increasing access to home AC for those who are at risk and, (2) building a connected and resilient community prior to an emergency heat event to overcome the tendency toward social isolation. Social capital is a critical component of community resilience [

Our results on checking in on neighbors and family members indicate that low-income residents and racial minorities are already relying on social capital as a component of their resilience, which may be due to lack of access to other types of capital. These existing social networks can be leveraged in intervention design to improve the reach of information and the uptake of protective behaviors during heat events.
