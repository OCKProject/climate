<p class="p">These results provide support to climate change adaptation initiatives focused on local preparedness, communication, and community engagement. Following the 2011 survey and focus groups conducted in 2012, the DOHMH reexamined and refined its risk communication strategies. That research pointed to a disconnect in risk perception, with vulnerable people recognizing that heat was dangerous in theory but not necessarily considering themselves to be at risk. DOHMH revised its summer heat brochure to further emphasize that heat could be deadly, highlight the indoor risk to vulnerable individuals without access to AC, and communicate the need to check on vulnerable individuals during extreme heat. To supplement the messaging campaign, DOHMH developed a postcard to provide guidance on how to check on vulnerable contacts. The agency developed “Talking Points” [

DOHMH continues to refine its heat protection strategies using results from heat-health research and surveillance [
