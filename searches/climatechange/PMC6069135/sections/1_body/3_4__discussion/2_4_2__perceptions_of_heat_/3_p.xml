<p class="p">The results of this study also provide insights into how New Yorkers perceive the risk of heat-health threats from climate change. According to the findings, two-thirds of the population was concerned about heat health-related effects of climate change. While some research has indicated that low-income individuals are disengaged from the problem of climate change [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-01433" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], our results suggest that having a lower household income significantly predicts oneâ€™s perception of climate change as a health threat, reflecting an accurate perception of having fewer resources to adapt. These results echo findings in Maryland residents, where vulnerable populations (including those in low-income households) perceived their own climate change health vulnerability to be greater than the public at large [

Our findings suggest that low-income individuals may be particularly receptive to heat-health interventions and climate adaptation planning.
