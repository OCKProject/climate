<p class="p">Although heat warning penetration is relatively high, the perception that heat is a danger remains low among the general population. Less than half of New Yorkers reported a belief that on very hot days, the heat inside their home is very likely or somewhat likely to cause them to become ill. This matches findings of a North American multicity study, which found that most respondents were aware of heat warnings, but many did not consider themselves vulnerable to heat and few reported behavior changes to protect themselves [

These findings may partially be explained because a substantial fraction of the population has high adaptive capacity and is aware of this. Our results indicate that individuals from low-income households have higher risk perception than those from higher income households. These risk perceptions may simply accurately reflect the reality that low-income individuals perceive for themselves, in which they have limited resources to protect themselves from high heat exposure.
