<p class="p">These results also point to the continued need to expand AC access among vulnerable low-income and non-Hispanic black individuals. To offset increased AC use in heat emergency situations, when the electric grid can be stressed, strategies are needed to promote more equitable use of AC, including reduced commercial use. Ensuring that those who need AC to protect their health have access to it, while also being mindful of energy conservation issues, can help reduce electric grid strain during extreme heat events, while protecting the health of the most vulnerable. Further, research integrating building design, thermal comfort, and climate change adaptation is needed [
