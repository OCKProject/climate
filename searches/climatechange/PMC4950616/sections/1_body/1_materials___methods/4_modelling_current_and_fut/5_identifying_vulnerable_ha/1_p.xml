<p class="p">We focused on Quebec’s productive forest territory to evaluate whether predicted future conditions remained suitable for a species within its baseline range. For this purpose, the baseline range of a species was defined as the set of grid cells within Quebec productive forests where the baseline average model predicted a suitable habitat (WAP

Note that a ‘suitable habitat’ does not necessarily mean an ‘optimal habitat’, since a species can be found on sites with suboptimal conditions. Cells modelled as suitable habitat under baseline climatic conditions, but which became unsuitable under future climate conditions, were classified as unsuitable habitat (UH). Cells modelled as ‘suitable’ under both baseline and future climate further subdivided as:
