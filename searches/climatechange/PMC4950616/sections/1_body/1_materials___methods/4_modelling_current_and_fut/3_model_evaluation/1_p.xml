<p class="p">The predictive model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC; 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fielding &amp; Bell</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>) as an accuracy measure. The area under the ROC function (AUC) is usually taken to be an important index because it provides a single measure of overall accuracy that is not dependent upon a particular threshold. Suggested AUC values for classifying the accuracy of models using AUC are: 0.90–1.00 = excellent; 0.80–0.9 = good; 0.70–0.80 = fair; 0.60–0.70 = poor; 0.50–0.60 = fail (e.g.,
