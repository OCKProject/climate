<p class="p">We used 14 predictor variables for modelling (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), including 3 climate, 1 elevation, 7 soil-class, and 3 soil property variables. The three climate variables were selected among a set of climate variables through cluster analysis (see below). Collinearity diagnostics measuring the relationship between the selected climate variables and other environmental variables were done using several methods (pairwise scatterplots, correlation coefficients, condition index, variance inflation factor). Collinearity was not found to be an issue at the scale of this study and for these sets of variables.
