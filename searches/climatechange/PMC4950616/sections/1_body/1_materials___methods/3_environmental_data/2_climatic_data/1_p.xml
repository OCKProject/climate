<p class="p">Normalized (1961–1990) monthly surfaces of total precipitation and average, maximum, and minimum temperatures were downloaded from the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain station website (

 <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rehfeldt et al.</xref>
 <xref rid="ref-81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">(2006)</xref> for more details). Data were obtained at a spatial resolution of 0.0083 decimal degrees (≈1 km) and averaged for each 20-km × 20-km grid cell of the modelling area. Climate variables tend to be highly correlated, so we used the VARCLUS procedure in SAS 9.2 (
 <xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">SAS Institute Inc</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) to find groups of variables that were as correlated as possible among themselves and as uncorrelated as possible with variables in other clusters. This analysis led to three clusters; in each cluster, we then selected one climate variable influencing plant survival and growth. They were mean annual temperature (TEM), mean annual precipitation (PRE) and useful precipitation (i.e., the ratio of the sum of June, July, August and September monthly precipitation to total annual precipitation; PRATIO).
