<p class="p">Note that emission scenarios are now represented by four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), which became available with the IPCC fifth assessment report and after this study was initiated. The RCPs span a larger range of stabilization, mitigation and non-mitigation pathways than the range covered by the SRES we used (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-12" class="xref">Table S2</xref>). As a result, the RCPs now estimate a larger range of temperature increase than the SRES (

 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Some models do perform better than others for certain climate variables, but no individual model is clearly the best overall. The comparison of median model capability in reproducing historical climate shows relatively modest improvement between CMIP3 and the current CMIP5 generation (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Flato et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Each generation exhibits a range in performance, with CMIP5 showing fewer ‘bad models’ than CMIP3, but the species distribution modelling uses a consensus approach similar to looking at an ensemble mean of General Circulation Models. As well, for climate projections, we used the delta method (see above) where only relative changes from the GCMs are calculated and then applied to observed data. In this case, a similar range in changes of temperature and precipitation between CMIP5 and CMIP3 is what matters most in terms of species distribution model results. A detailed comparison of CMIP3 and CMIP5 is beyond the scope of this paper, but interested readers can consult
