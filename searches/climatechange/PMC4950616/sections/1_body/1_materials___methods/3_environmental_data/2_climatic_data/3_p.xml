<p class="p">For each climate simulation, future (2071–2100) TEM, PRE and PRATIO values were obtained using the “change field” method (

 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>). Monthly mean differences between the baseline period model run (1961–1990) and the future climate model run (2071–2100) were calculated and then combined with baseline values of the observed monthly climate data set. However, due to the relatively coarse spatial resolution of the climate simulations (45 km per cell side for the regional coupled atmosphere–ocean model, and ∼250-km per cell side for the general coupled atmosphere–ocean circulation models), monthly delta values for the centroids of each 20-km × 20-km grid cell (6,418 in all) were interpolated using a linear triangle-based interpolation method (

 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) between climate model grid cell centroids. Climate simulations for each month were then created by applying interpolated delta values to each observed grid cell value.
