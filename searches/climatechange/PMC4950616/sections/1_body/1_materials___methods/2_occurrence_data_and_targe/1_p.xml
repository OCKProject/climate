<p class="p">For the eastern United States, our main source of information was the Climate Change Atlas database (
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Landscape Change Research Group</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). For the Canadian part of the modelling area, we obtained data on tree species occurrence from more than 95,000 forest plots sampled across the province and inventoried from 1985 to 1998 by the ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs (Quebec’s Ministery of Forests, Wildlife and Parks). The presence (or absence) of each forest tree species was recorded in each of the 6,418 cells of the modelling area.
