<p class="p">We focused our study on forests of Quebec (Canada), which account for 20% of the total Canadian forests and 2% of the world’s forests. Dense forests cover an area of 761,100 km

 <italic class="italic">Sustainable Forest Development Act</italic>). Quebec forests are largely under public management (91.6% of forest land) with the responsible ministry allocating harvesting rights. The productive forest territory (45°N–53°N) mainly comprises the northern temperate and boreal vegetation zones (

The zones are further divided, on the basis of edaphic and climatic conditions, into characteristic plant communities of ecological and economic importance or bioclimatic domains. The northern temperate zone includes, from south to north: the sugar maple–bitternut hickory domain (14,500 km

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>)—all three being grouped in this study as the sugar maple domains—and the balsam fir–yellow birch domain (98,600 km
