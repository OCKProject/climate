<p class="p">Here, we take advantage of available information on tree species distributions from forest survey programs in Quebec (Canada) and the eastern United States to assess potential decline in habitat suitability associated with climate change for five dominant tree species of deciduous and coniferous forests. Given the ecological and economic importance of these species, a change in their distribution and dynamics could make entire ecosystems, ecoregions, and economies vulnerable. Consequently, we focus on areas where climate is predicted to become unsuitable or less suitable for these species as opposed to habitat gain or range shift to emphasize vulnerabilities rather than opportunities. These species are, in order of decreasing merchantable volume in Quebec forests:

 <italic class="italic">Abies balsamea</italic> (L.) Mill. (balsam fir), 
 <italic class="italic">Betula papyrifera</italic> Marshall (white birch, synonym of paper birch), 
 <italic class="italic">Acer saccharum</italic> Marsh. (sugar maple) and 
 <italic class="italic">Betula alleghaniensis</italic> Britton (yellow birch). We base our assessment on a rigorous modelling approach using data spanning two jurisdictions (United States and Canada), but focus our interpretation at the scale of ecologically and economically significant bioclimatic domains which are defined by the target species in Quebec forests. We assume that (1) even though other factors can limit tree distribution (

This is especially the case in boreal forests where most tree species grow slowly (
