<p class="p">During the last century, forest conservation policies and management practices worldwide have been developed assuming a relatively stable climate regime. Indeed, apart from occasional extreme events, climate was largely considered as a stable dimension, over decades or centuries, of a speciesâ€™ niche or habitat. Although tree species distribution ranges have expanded or shrunk in response to climate, detectable shifts largely occurred at time scales comparable to those of climate change in the Quaternary, that is, within centuries or millennia for long-lived trees (

Impacts could be profound on forest species distributions, community structure, and ecosystem functions, as well as on all economic activities and services that depend on forests (
