<p class="p">Our study area covers large regions where forest logging, especially of softwood stands, contributes significantly to the economy. Forests provide habitats and contribute to global carbon storage. Be it with species distribution models (

Sustaining yield could become increasingly difficult in these conditions. Reforestation planning will have to take into account climate trajectory and maps indicating areas at risk. Although it will be tempting to log declining forests, it will be as important to preserve reference areas under natural disturbances in order to understand ‘natural’ dynamics and adapt management options accordingly. New engagement rules with the forest industry, which may see areas at risk as opportunities for salvage logging, will be needed.
