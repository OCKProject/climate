<p class="p">To respond to the climate change challenge for forests, efforts are focusing on three fronts: (1) Risk assessment, including the targeted monitoring of areas at risk, in order to understand forest dynamics under changing conditions. Quebec has the advantage of having established a large network of forest sites under observation since the 1970s (

 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Assessment of climate change-related risk is probably where most research efforts have focused so far, but there is still a need to better identify and target areas and species at risk. (2) Risk communication with stakeholders, decision makers, and the public in general. During the last decade, a great deal of work has been done to provide conceptual frameworks and provide new approaches and tools for decision making under uncertainty (

 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In Quebec, the recent publication of the results of a large study involving scientists and stakeholders on the impacts of climate change on Quebec biodiversity is a positive step in that direction (

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). When communicating risk, it is indeed important to indicate the uncertainty inherent in all projections. However, the scientific emphasis on uncertainty has also been seen as possibly deterring from early action regarding climate change policies (

 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). (3) Risk management, which involves basing decisions on the best information available (
 <xref rid="ref-103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yousefpour et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This may be the most challenging aspect. Comparing the outcomes of alternative management scenarios in relation to predicted responses of forest to climate change could inform management decisions (
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Messier et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). If they are not already in place, adaptation strategies are needed, if only to allow sufficient time for forest ecosystems and regional forest economies to adapt. In spite of their well-recognised limitations, regionally-explicit risk assessment approaches, such as the one used here, currently remain one of the best options to convey the need for climate policies and forest management adaptation strategies.
