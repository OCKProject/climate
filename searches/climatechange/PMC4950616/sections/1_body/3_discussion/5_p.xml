<p class="p">There is uncertainty in model projections because of uncertainty in climate simulations, statistical models, and the non-linear responses of ecosystems and species. Climate simulations are improving (

 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) and the limitations of different statistical models are well recognised (
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marmion et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009a</xref>). These limitations are often taken into account, for instance by using consensus approaches across several statistical and climate models (

 <xref rid="ref-97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wang et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The level of agreement among our projections was generally high (averaging 75%), raising confidence in our results given the data available. Nevertheless, the main source of uncertainty may rest not so much in the methodology used than in the model assumptions. There is no doubt that climate is a strong predictor of site occupancy patterns for species, particularly at broad spatial scale (

 <xref rid="ref-76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>). What remains unclear, however, is the extent to which climate mainly determines species range boundaries and whether current distribution patterns really capture the physiological limits of species (

 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Paul, Bergeron &amp; Tremblay</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). The availability of suitable conditions other than climate (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beauregard &amp; De Blois</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">in press</xref>), postglacial dispersal limitations, or competition can all contribute to species not filling their available climatic niche (
 <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sinclair, White &amp; Newell</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>). Coupling physiological models or trait information with correlative range models can help refine projections (
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Iverson et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Talluto et al.</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), providing that physiological models capture species responses outside the range of conditions represented by species presence-absence data. If there is, for instance, evidence for climatically suitable sites colder than those currently captured by the observed species’ range, the consequences may be minimal on risk assessment related to warming. If, on the other hand, there is evidence for climatically suitable sites warmer than those currently defined by a species’ range—or greater tolerance to warming than previously thought , future projections are likely to overestimate the risk of climate change on species distribution. Since species interactions also influence species distribution—but are somewhat integrated in models based on a species’ realised niche, another unresolved issue is how communities will reassemble. Disagreements as to the geographical extent of climate vulnerability are likely to persist until monitoring and field evidence clearly show trends in support of (or in disagreement with) projections in a given region. Models can only point towards species or areas at risk for greater scrutiny and, most of all, provide incentive for developing and testing adaptation strategies.
