<p class="p">Warming experiments can show direct physiological effect on individual trees, but it is not always clear how warming can influence whole species assemblages over a range of soil conditions. Increased frequency and intensity of droughts, for instance, have led to negative effects on the duration of xylogenesis and the production of xylem cells in balsam fir in warming experiments (
