<p class="p">Because of the strong northâ€“south climatic gradient in Quebec, species are projected to retract from their southern margins in the study area with warming. Biotic interactions are often emphasized over climate in determining southern range edges (

 <xref rid="ref-88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and so this raises the question of whether competitive processes mediated by species traits over novel climatic conditions will help shift dominance of species locally. For instance, balsam fir is more fire-sensitive than black spruce and shifts in fire regime in the northern boreal forests over millennia have shifted dominance towards one species or the other, with warm and wet conditions favouring balsam fir over black spruce (

Moreover, the observed northward migration of pests, such as spruce budworms, facilitated by climate change is also contributing to increase the intensity and frequency of outbreaks in some areas. Whereas balsam fir is currently considered a more suitable host than black spruce, this may change when the budworm hits spruce-dominated forests (
