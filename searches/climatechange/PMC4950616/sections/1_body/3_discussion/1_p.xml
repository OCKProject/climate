<p class="p">Most studies linking climate change with species distribution models emphasize the potential for major shifts in species ranges and a massive reorganisation of biodiversity. Our study is no exception but here we focus on areas where species are projected to become at risk of climate change-related stress to help define adaptation strategies. We define ‘risk’ as a function of the probability of an event (climate becoming unsuitable or less suitable for a species as projected) and the severity of its consequences (

Whereas one can rightly argue that there is still much uncertainty in assessing probability of species occurrence in a changing climate, there is no doubt that the consequences of habitat decline at a particular location can be highly significant for ecosystems and economies that depend on, or are defined by these species. Risk assessment through climate/species models, therefore, has at least two immediate benefits. Just as for climate projections, it can help draw attention of policy makers, forest management agencies, and the public in general on the sheer magnitude of projected climate change effects on biodiversity. Secondly, because models are spatially-explicit and species-specific, they can help target monitoring efforts, especially when resources are scarce, and potentially inform adaptation strategies.
