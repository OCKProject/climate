<p class="p">The baseline range of sugar maple covers 31% of Quebecâ€™s productive forests, essentially in the south. Shifts towards unsuitability (8%) or less suitability (1.3%) are projected for 9.3% of the sugar maple baseline range (agreement value = 60%). All sites shifting to unsuitable conditions are in the sugar maple domains. The more northern domains are predicted to maintain their current habitats for sugar maple.</p>
