<p class="p">The baseline range for black spruce in the study area essentially covers all five bioclimatic domains. Overall, 78% of the baseline range of black spruce in Quebec’s productive forest is projected to shift towards unsuitable (18%) or less suitable (60%) conditions compared to baseline conditions (agreement value = 68%). Shifts in suitability are projected largely within the sugar maple domain (89% of baseline spruce habitat in that domain shifting to unsuitable), the balsam fir–yellow birch domain (13% shifting to unsuitable), and the balsam fir–white birch domain (2% shifting to unsuitable). Moreover, all the remaining baseline habitats in these domains are projected to become less suitable for black spruce compared to baseline climatic conditions. In the spruce–moss domain, 52% of suitable habitats are projected to become less suitable for the species.</p>
