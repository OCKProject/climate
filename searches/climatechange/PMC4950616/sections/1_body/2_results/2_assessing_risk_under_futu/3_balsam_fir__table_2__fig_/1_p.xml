<p class="p">The baseline range for balsam fir covers more than 97% of Quebec’s productive forests. Overall, 59% of the baseline range of balsam fir is projected to shift towards unsuitable (21%) or less suitable (38%) climatic conditions (agreement value = 69%) with climate change. Essentially, all baseline sites over the entire sugar maple domains and the balsam fir–yellow birch domain are projected to become unsuitable or less suitable. Further north, in the balsam fir–white birch domain, shifts towards unsuitability are projected on 1% of the range, while less suitable conditions are projected on another 87%.</p>
