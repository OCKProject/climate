<p class="p">White birch is widely distributed in the study area with a baseline range covering 94% of Quebec’s productive forests. Overall, 62% of the baseline range of balsam fir is projected to shift towards unsuitable (14%) or less suitable (48%) climatic conditions (agreement value = 71%) with climate change. In the sugar maple domains, unsuitability is projected on 63% of the baseline range, with the remainder projected as less suitable compared to baseline conditions. Only 2% of habitats shifts towards unsuitability in the balsam fir–yellow birch domain, but less suitable habitats are projected in 67% of the balsam fir–yellow birch domain, 79% of the balsam fir–white birch domain, and 15% of the spruce–moss domain.</p>
