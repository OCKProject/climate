<p class="p">Overall, all the models performed well and showed good capacity on species prediction as accuracies showed high values (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-13" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). The AUC values of the average models ranged from 0.916 (sugar maple) to 0.984 (for balsam fir), for a mean value of 0.958 Â± 0.029. We also determined that the largest part of variability in future projections was explained by the SDMs (
