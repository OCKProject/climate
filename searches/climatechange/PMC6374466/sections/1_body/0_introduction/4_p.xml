 <italic class="italic">Acropora hyacinthus</italic> (Dana, 1846), is widely distributed in the tropical, subtropical, and some part of temperate regions of the Indo-Pacific

 <italic class="italic">hyacinthus</italic> species complex is a hermaphroditic, broadcast-spawning species whose fertilization takes place in the water column. More than 70% of the larvae settle within one week

 <italic class="italic">hyacinthus</italic> is one of the key reef-building species on tropical reefs

 </sup>. These ecological features of this species are suitable for comparing the genetic diversity and connectivity of populations among temperate and subtropical regions. We defined the region south of the Watase Line
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup> as subtropical and the region north of the Watase Line as temperate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The region was split along this line because the biogeography of this region is often split between Yakushima and the Amami Islands, and the Kuroshio Current passes through this region.
