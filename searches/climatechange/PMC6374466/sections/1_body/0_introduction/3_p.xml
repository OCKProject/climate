<p id="Par4" class="p">This study aimed to assess the genetic structures of recently expanded populations and examine the potential role of temperate regions as coral refugia in Japan. We thus examined the genetic diversity and meta-population structures of the subtropical to northernmost temperate populations of the reef-building coral 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora hyacinthus</italic>, and the results were further compared with contemporary larval dispersal simulations in an oceanographic model.
