  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. However, no studies have assessed the genetic diversity or structures of such coral populations, including the recently colonized temperate populations that expanded within the last 50 years as a result of climate change along the Kuroshio Current. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge of the oceanographic larval dispersal processes that shape the genetic variations and population structures of corals in the high-latitude regions of Japan.
