In this paper, authors noted that “Refugia are habitats that components of biodiversity retreat to, persist in and can potentially expand from under changing environmental conditions and facilitates the persistence of species under anthropogenic climate change.” Population connectivity and relatively high genetic diversity are crucial for a population to expand and persist under climate change
