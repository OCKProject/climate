<p id="Par15" class="p">Reduced genetic diversity (heterozygosity, allelic richness, and clonal rate) was observed in the recently expanded 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora hyacinthus</italic> populations distributed near the edge of the species’ range. One historical interpretation is that reduced genetic diversity near the edge of a species’ range is the result of greater isolation in peripheral populations than in core populations where species are more abundant than along the periphery

 </sup>. However, this study did not detect a gradual increase in genetic isolation towards peripheral populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Alternatively, IBD patterns produced by a simple linear stepping-stone model explains the reduced genetic diversity near the edge. If a population structure is assumed to exhibit linearly uniform distribution over a large distance with limited migration in a simple linear stepping-stone model, then IBD genetic structure can theoretically be observed

 </sup>. Under such a situation, Tajima
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> demonstrated that the level of DNA polymorphism is highest in the central populations and gradually decreases towards peripheral populations. Our data relatively fit this linear stepping-stone model because significant IBD patterns were observed when oceanographic distance was used. Although more data are needed, a linear stepping-stone model can at least partially explain the observed patterns. Lastly, it is also possible that genetic diversity will decrease towards the edge of a species’ range in response to different selection pressures

 </sup> and subsequently erode genetic diversity. On the other hand, the larger genetic diversity in the subtropical populations can be partly explained by possible hybridization between closely related lineages (as found in Fig.
