<p id="Par16" class="p">Some previous studies have also provided evidence for reduced genetic diversity in peripheral coral populations. For example, both brooder and broadcaster coral species in the southernmost reef in the Pacific showed lowered genetic diversity

These studies suggested that a small founding population, small effective population size of genetic drift, or inbreeding depression caused reduced genetic diversity in peripheral coral populations. However, expanding coral populations do not always follow this trend of reduced genetic diversity, as was demonstrated in the Mediterranean coral
