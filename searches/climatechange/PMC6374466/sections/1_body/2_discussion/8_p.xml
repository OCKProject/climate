<p id="Par21" class="p">We expected that the larval dispersal model rather than oceanographic distance would have significant IBD patterns because genetic structure is considered to be most associated with larval dispersal. However, the IBD patterns that were derived using the number of larvae between sites based on numerical simulations did not improve in comparison to those using Euclidean distances and oceanographic distances (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). This result might be because the genetic markers used in this study captured historical events rather than contemporary gene flow, especially in the

  <italic class="italic">ST</italic>
 </sub> calculations, which assume equilibrium. Similarly, the genetic distance of sea stars across the Indo-Pacific region was best explained by Euclidean distance and not modelled larval distance in a previous study

 </sub> reflected historical gene flow rather than contemporary gene flow. Another explanation for the weak correlation with IBD patterns is the lack of biological characteristics (i.e., larval behaviour) in the larval dispersal models used in this study. A more sophisticated model that includes the biological aspects of
