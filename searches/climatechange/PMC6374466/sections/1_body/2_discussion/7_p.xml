<p id="Par20" class="p">Significant IBD patterns were detected only when oceanographic distance was used (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), which indicates that pairwise genetic distances (

 <sub class="sub">

 </sub>) significantly increased with geographic distance. This result indicates that overall, the effect of genetic drift is stronger than the effect of gene flow between distant populations.
