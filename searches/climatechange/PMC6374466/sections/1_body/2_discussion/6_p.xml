<p id="Par19" class="p">Although the recently expanded Goto populations (GAHo) had low genetic diversity and a small number of samples was analysed (MGL = 9), one individual had a private allele. One possible explanation is that harsh environments around GAH (Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>) caused some strong directional selective pressures on the coral populations, which reduced the genetic diversity and changed the allele frequencies, as was discussed above (selective pressure increased the frequency of rare alleles, and a private allele was found). Alternatively, the Goto population was colonized by other genetically diverged populations, such as those from Taiwan through the Taiwan-Tsushima warm current system
