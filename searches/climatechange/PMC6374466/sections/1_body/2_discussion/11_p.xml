<p id="Par24" class="p">This study indicated that recently expanded marginal populations could have low genetic diversity and are possibly more vulnerable to environmental changes than pre-existing populations. This finding underpins the importance of assessing the genetic diversity of populations that have recently expanded due to climate change for conservation purposes, in particular when anticipating the roles of these areas as refugia under climate change.</p>
