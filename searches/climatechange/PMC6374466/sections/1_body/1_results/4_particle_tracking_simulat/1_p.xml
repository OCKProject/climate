<p id="Par13" class="p">Larval dispersal generally occurred northward along the Kuroshio Current (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6b,c</xref>). Larval dispersal from temperate to subtropical areas seemed uncommon within a single generation because larval dispersal is physically limited to the path of the Kuroshio Current (here called the Kuroshio-associated barrier), although dispersal could be achieved through multiple generations or occasional long dispersals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>). The Kuroshio-associated barrier corresponds to the biogeographic boundary called the Watase Line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Unidirectional dispersal was observed from the western Kyushu region (E in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>) along the Tsushima Current to the temperate region along the southern Japanese coast (B in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>) along the main stream of the Kuroshio Current (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6c</xref>).
