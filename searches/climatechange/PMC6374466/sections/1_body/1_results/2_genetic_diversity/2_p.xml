<p id="Par8" class="p">After removing possible clones, the north peripheral populations had reduced genetic diversity, which was observed in particular in the recently expanded populations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Genetic diversity metrics (allelic richness and heterozygosity) were more significantly reduced in the recently expanded populations than in the rest of the pre-existing temperate populations (Wilcoxon test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.010 and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.038 for allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, respectively) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Similarly, the genetic diversity metrics were significantly higher in subtropical populations than temperate ones (Wilcoxon test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.007 and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.028 for allelic richness and expected heterozygosity, respectively). Notably, all temperate populations, except for one north Yakushima population (KAHyn), had more than one fixed (monomorphic) locus. All the recently expanded populations had 2 to 4 fixed loci out of 8 loci (Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). In total, 24 individuals had private alleles. Eight out of the 32 individuals (25.0%) examined in the subtropical populations had private alleles, and 11 out of the 149 (7.4%) individuals in the pre-existing temperate populations had private alleles. Two out of 59 individuals (3.4%) were found to have private alleles in the recently expanded populations (One from Goto Island, GAHo, and another from Amakusa, AMK). These results suggest that subtropical populations have more private alleles than temperate populations, and recently expanded populations possibly originated from a small number of individuals with low genetic diversity.
