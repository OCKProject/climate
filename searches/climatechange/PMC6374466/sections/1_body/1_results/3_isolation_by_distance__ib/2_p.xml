 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). This result suggests that populations in temperate regions were generally genetically close to each other. Pairwise tests showed almost no genetic differentiation among the recently expanded populations, whereas there were some significantly differentiated pairs among the pre-existing populations (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The Tsukijima population in Miyazaki (TUK) was one of the most isolated populations in the temperate region, most likely because the artificial structure surrounding this population (N. Yasuda pers. obs.) hindered larval exchange.
