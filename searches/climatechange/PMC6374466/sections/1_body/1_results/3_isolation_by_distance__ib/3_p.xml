<p id="Par11" class="p">STRUCTURE analysis was again performed within the green lineage with and without prior information (subtropical vs temperate). The results indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 1 best explained the data (Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">5a,b</xref>), which suggests admixture and no clear genetic divergence between the temperate and subtropical regions, and these findings are consistent with the AMOVA results. However, when using the LOCPRIOR model, different proportions of assigned lineages were found between temperate and subtropical regions at 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) with a small 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> value (0.869), which implies that very small genetic differences exist between the two regions.
