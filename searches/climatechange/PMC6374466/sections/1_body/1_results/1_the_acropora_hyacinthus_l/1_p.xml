<p id="Par6" class="p">Only 10366m5 has possible null alleles, and we thus excluded this locus from the genetic analysis of the population. A previous study indicated that there are cryptic species (lineages) in 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora hyacinthus</italic> that are morphologically indistinguishable
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, we identified the cryptic lineages in our dataset using STRUCTURE analysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> to determine the lineage associated with the recently expanded populations in temperate regions. After removing 44 possible clones, our STRUCTURE analyses based on 645 multilocus genotypes (MLGs) indicated that the most likely number of clusters was 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 2, followed by 3 (Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). At 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 2, temperate populations and some of the subtropical individuals were assigned to the same cluster (green lineage in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and the other lineage was restricted to south of Miyazaki. At 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 3, the subtropical specific cluster at 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 2 (red in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) was further split into two different clusters (red and blue in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) results also supported different lineages (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Moreover, populations with two or three different genetic lineages belonged to different clades in the neighbour-joining (NJ) phylogenetic trees (Suppl. 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). These results, as well as those of a previous study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>
 </sup>, indicated that these populations are possibly different species
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>
 </sup>. Because we are interested in the genetic connectivity and diversity of the lineages that have recently expanded in temperate regions, we focused on one lineage (green lineage in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) found in both temperate and subtropical regions. Individuals assigned to the green lineage with probabilities ≥70% in both the 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 2 and 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 3 results were used for the following analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). A relatively low value ≥70% was chosen because that lineage was rather rare in the subtropical region and many individuals found in the subtropical area are partially admixed with other lineages. Populations with ≥9 MLGs were used for subsequent analysis because smaller sample sizes are not suitable for population genetic analysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. The final dataset included 240 individuals from 13 populations (shown in bold in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Initially, significant linkage disequilibrium was found in two pairs of loci (11401m4 and Amil2-23; 11401m4 and Amil2-2). However, linkages disappeared in the final dataset, which included only one lineage and no clones.
