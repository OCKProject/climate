 </sub> values were regressed onto (1) Euclidean distances between sites, (2) oceanographic distances avoiding physically impossible routes (e.g., passing on land) that were manually estimated using Google Earth and (3) simulated number of accumulated larvae based on a particle tracking model with iterations after 1000 generations (see below, Suppl.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>). We used two different datasets, one including all green lineage populations and the other excluding four recently expanded populations. Significance was tested using the Mantel permutation test (10,000 randomizations) using R ver. 3.4.2. Because the TUK population was surrounded by artificial structures that prevented larval dispersal, this population was excluded from the IBD analysis.
