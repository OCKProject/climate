 </sup> with default settings. Individuals were assigned to a source population when an individual had the highest assigned probability &gt;70%, and others were regarded as unassigned. Because the two geographically close Wakayama populations (WAHs and WAHk) and the two Goto populations (GAHo and GAHk) were not significantly differentiated (TableÂ
