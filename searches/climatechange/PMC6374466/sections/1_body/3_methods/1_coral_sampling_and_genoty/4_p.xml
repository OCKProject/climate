<p id="Par28" class="p">The clonal structure of each coral population was examined by identifying the same MLGs based on 8 microsatellite loci; these were identified as possible clones (asexually reproduced by fragmentation), and all except one were excluded from subsequent analyses. The inbreeding coefficient of a population (
