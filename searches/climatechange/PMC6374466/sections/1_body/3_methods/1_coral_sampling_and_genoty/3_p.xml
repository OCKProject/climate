<p id="Par27" class="p">The multiplexed PCR product was diluted by 100, and 1 μl of the diluted PCR product was added to 10 μl of highly deionized formamide containing 0.15 μl of the GeneScan-600 (LIZ) size standard (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for genotyping on an ABI 3730xl automated sequencer (GeneMapper® ver. 5, Applied Biosystems), which was used to determine the fragment sizes (alleles) of all samples. All genotyping was manually checked. Whenever we found ambiguous patterns or no peak, we re-extracted the genomic DNA and re-amplified it or removed the sample from the analysis. We tested for the presence of null alleles using MICRO-CHECKER ver. 2.2.3
