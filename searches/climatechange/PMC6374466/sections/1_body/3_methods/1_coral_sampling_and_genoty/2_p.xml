 </sup>. Eight loci were amplified in 2 multiplex PCR sets using different dyes and non-overlapping loci (Plex1 includes 8346m3, 11401m4, 8499m4, and 10366m5; Plex2 included Amil2-2h, Amil2-23h, Amil2-10, and Amil2-12). For Amil2-2h and Amil2-23h, we used modified primers to increase PCR efficiency for

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>). We used an 8 μl reaction containing 1 μl of template DNA, 0.03 μl of each primer (50 μM), 4 μl of Type It (Microsatellite Kit, Qiagen), and 2.94 μl of water. The thermal cycler profile that was used had an initial denaturation step at 95 °C for 3 min followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C/30 s, 50 °C/30 s, 72 °C/30 s, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 min.
