 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Wherever possible about 5 cm of skeleton specimens were collected and deposited at the University of Miyazaki (MUFS-Acr101–310, 371–428, 500–531, 569–717, 768–801). Species identification was further confirmed by Dr. Hironobu Fukami based on morphological information.
