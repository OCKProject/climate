CMS can evaluate a full range of transport and fate variabilities at high computational efficiency. In the particle tracking model, larvae are treated as passive particles transported on the surface by horizontal current velocities. The particles regarded as larvae were totally released from 111 habitat zones of 1/12° × 1/12° rectangles (~10 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6a</xref>). The timings of spawning (particle release) from each site were assumed to have begun on the first full moon before the integrated water temperature anomaly from 13 °C from February 1st exceeded 1000 °C day (∫max(T-13, 0)dt). The parameters for estimating the spawning dates (1 °C, February 1
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>, and 1000 °C·day) were determined by trial-and-error adjustment using previous records of 
 <italic class="italic">Acropora</italic> spawning timing in Japan. The estimated spawning dates were in general agreement with the records of previous spawning timing (Aizawa 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. unpub. data). The time-series dataset of sea surface temperature used to estimate spawning timing at each site was obtained by extraction from the Global HYCOM analysis/reanalysis products. Spawning events were assumed to take place 3 days before the spawning full moon and to continue for 10 days. From each site, 50 particles were released each day, and a total of 500 particles were released in one year. The maximum larval dispersal period was set for 42 days, which is the maximum length of pelagic larval duration of

 <italic class="italic">hyacinthus</italic>. It was assumed that larvae could begin settling on coral habitats three days after particle release. When the particles passed by the coral habitats, the particles were counted as successful recruitments (the number of larvae dispersed from one place). Finally, a connectivity matrix was obtained by conducting the particle tracking simulation for a total of 24 years from 1993 to 2016. Using the average of the 24-year connectivity matrix, we iterated particle dispersal to simulate the long-term accumulation of dispersed larvae and consider the stepping-stone-like connectivity. This calculation was repeated until the number of the accumulated particle stabilized over time (1000 generations).
