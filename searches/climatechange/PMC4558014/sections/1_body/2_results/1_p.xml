<p class="p">Our study suggests that by 2080, under a high-emissions scenario (SRES A2), breeding and non-breeding ranges of North American birds are projected to change dramatically in size and location. These changes will produce distinct patterns of species gains and losses across the continent (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). During the breeding season, bird communities may gain as many as 80 species, centered on the far northern Canadian provinces, especially boreal forests, and central Alaska, and lose as many as 69 species (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>). Peak areas of loss include much of the area along the U.S.-Canadian border where Eastern deciduous forests, prairie potholes, as well as the high elevations of the Rockies and Sierra ranges occur. During the non-breeding season, bird communities may gain as many as 92 species, mainly in the border regions with Canada and Mexico, and may lose as many as 65 species (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>). Peak areas of loss in the non-breeding season are centered on central and southern California, the Gulf region, and southern coastal states (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1a</xref>). Future mid- and low-emissions scenarios (SRES A1B and B2, respectively) show patterns of species gain and loss through time that are broadly similar, in both magnitude and location, to projections from the A2 scenario (
