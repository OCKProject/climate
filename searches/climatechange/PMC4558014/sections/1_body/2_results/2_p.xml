<p class="p">Combining projected range gains and losses suggests that future bird communities will differ markedly from current communities, particularly during the breeding season (
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1c</xref>). For the SRES A2, 2080 climate change scenario, mean dissimilarity between the present and future was 0.470 for the breeding season and 0.374 for the non-breeding season. In the breeding season, dissimilarity was greatest in the boreal forests and western United States. In the non-breeding season, dissimilarity was greatest around the Great Lakes and in northern Alaska.
