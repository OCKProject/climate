<p class="p">Bioclimatic variables are thought to represent biologically meaningful combinations of monthly climate variables because they aggregate climate information in ways known to drive biological processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Bioclimatic variables can be highly correlated, however, which raises concerns about the ability of modeling algorithms to identify causal relationships in data sets and to generate accurate predictions [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. A variety of approaches to clustering or removing predictors can be employed in an effort to reduce collinearity but none of them guarantee better inference or prediction [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Ultimately, iterative assessment of correlated variables through observation and experiment is needed. We chose not to remove variables from our data set because we had little or no 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> justification for choosing one correlated variable over another. In addition, our approach to matching bird data and climate data on an annual basis (described below) allowed correlations to vary across time and space, thus reducing the degree of collinearity.
