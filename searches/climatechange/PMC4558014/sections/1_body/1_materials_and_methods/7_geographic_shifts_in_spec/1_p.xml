<p class="p">We characterized changes in species distributions with respect to latitude, elevation, and distance from the coast to evaluate whether distributional responses to climate change might generalize across species. Simple hypotheses that focus on the role of cold temperature in limiting distributions predict geographic shifts northward, upslope, and inland as overall warming trends continue throughout the century (e.g., [

To characterize potential future shifts, we summarized latitude, elevation, and distance to coast values across current and future species distribution grids. Values in each grid cell were weighted by the proportion of each species distribution in the corresponding cell and averaged across all cells, resulting in centroid estimates of latitude, elevation, and distance to coast for each species in current and future time periods.
