<p class="p">We generated current species distributions by projecting modeled relationships across gridded annual bioclimatic data averaged from the same period used to construct the models. A spatial layer containing the median survey day was included as a constant in projections of BBS models and a layer containing the median number of survey hours was included as a constant in projections of CBC models. To characterize future climates and establish a spatial context for projections, we added future climate anomaly grids to baseline climate data in several processing steps. First, we obtained spatially downscaled (5-min resolution) climate grids for 13 combinations of general circulation models (GCMs) and emissions scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] summarized across each of three future time periods (2010–2039, 2040–2069, 2070–2099; hereafter 2020, 2050, 2080). We then subtracted contemporary WorldClim grids [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] for monthly minimum temperature, maximum temperature, and precipitation from the future grids to isolate predicted climate anomalies from baseline values. This resulted in a change value for each of the three variables between current and future for each month. Finally, we added these monthly anomaly grids to CFS mean climate grids for the base period (1971–2000) for each variable in each month, ensuring correspondence between the historical climate used to build the models and simulated future climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. We then transformed projected temperature and precipitation data into bioclimatic variables using DIVA software and the raster package [
