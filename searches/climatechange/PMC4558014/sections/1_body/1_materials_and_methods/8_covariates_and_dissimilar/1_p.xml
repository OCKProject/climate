<p class="p">Variance components analysis is a way to assess the amount of variation in a dependent variable that is associated with one or more predictor variables [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The central output is a variance components table that shows the proportion of variance attributable to each variable (note: the predictor variables have to be treated as random effects for this analysis). We used the lmer function, which is part of the lme4 package in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] to run random-effects ANOVAs to ascertain the percent of variation in current geographic range that is explained by four covariates relevant to bird conservation: species, migratory strategy [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], climate change scenario (SRES A2, A1B, B2), and habitat affinity (IUCN). This was done separately for both the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We also ran the same analyses, using relative change in range size as the response variable. Finally, we repeated all four variance components analyses using Audubonâ€™s habitat classifications to see if choice of habitat assignment scheme affected the results.
