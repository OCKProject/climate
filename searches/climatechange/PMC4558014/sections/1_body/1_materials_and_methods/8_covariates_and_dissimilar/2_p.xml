<p class="p">To estimate changes in community composition between the present and future, we used the vegdist function, part of the vegan package in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], to calculate binary Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (equivalent to 1—Sørensen similarity) for each grid cell. Dissimilarity was calculated for each season, comparing the present and 2080 (SRES A2). Dissimilarity results were then mapped to provide a community-level complement to estimates of species gains and losses derived from changes in individual species ranges.
