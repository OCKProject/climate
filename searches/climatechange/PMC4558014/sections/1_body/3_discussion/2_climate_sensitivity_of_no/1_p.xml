 <italic class="italic">Climate-endangered</italic> species (21.4%) are projected to lose more than half of current climatic range by 2050 without the potential to make up losses with gains in new areas. The climate-endangered group clearly faces the highest risk of extinction or extirpation from climate change. Current management prescriptions often focus on site-level resilience or helping species track their shifting climate niche [

 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Neither action seems likely to help species with shrinking geographic ranges. For example, high elevation and high latitude species groups are often thought to face the problem of shrinking geographic ranges without expansion potential [

 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Conservation of these shrinking range species requires the identification of areas within their current range that will remain climatically suitable into the future. In addition, since many 
 <italic class="italic">climate-endangered</italic> birds are not currently on any conservation priority list, there is no formal monitoring or legal protection for these most at risk species. For example, Bairdâ€™s Sparrow (
 <italic class="italic">Ammodramus bairdii</italic>) is projected to lose more than 95% of current range, yet is listed as a species of Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. Although listed as a priority species in some states (e.g., Wyoming; [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]), it is not in others (e.g. Colorado; [
 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]). We suggest that the 126 species in this category be considered by conservation entities for immediate monitoring beyond existing programs such as BBS and CBC.
