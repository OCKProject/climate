 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Uncertainty around the biological responses of species to climate change makes informed management actions difficult; however, adaptive management frameworks can be developed once species-level assessments become available (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]). As one of the best-studied groups in the world, birds offer an opportunity to model climate change responses for a taxon as a whole, at large geographic scales, and with sufficient spatial resolution to be meaningful for on-the-ground conservation. Furthermore, since birds are so widespread and cover so many habitats, birds are a reasonable proxy for the overall implications of climate change for all wildlife in North America. Previous climate studies of North American birds have focused on responses dealing with few species or limited geographies [
