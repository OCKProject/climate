 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] are valuable conservation tools useful for defining management priorities and goals, but typically do not include assessments of conservation risk due to future climate change. Climate sensitivity can be included in future species vulnerability assessments to help prioritize conservation investments and to provide testable predictions for future monitoring of at-risk species [

 <xref rid="pone.0135350.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Here we model the geographic ranges of 588 North American bird species across an array of future climate-emissions scenarios in both breeding and non-breeding seasons, and we use the results to assess the climate sensitivity of each species to inform conservation planning.
