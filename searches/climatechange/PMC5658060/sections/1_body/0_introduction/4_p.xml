 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> (Moraceae) is one of the most diverse genera of woody plants, with approximately 750 pantropical species divided almost equally between two breeding systems: monoecy or functional dioecy [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The characteristic of the genus is an enclosed inflorescence called syconium or fig. Fig tree populations produce syconia throughout the year [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], which make them a critical food resource for frugivores, particularly during the food scarcity season [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Thus, they are considered one of the keystone species in tropical forests [

 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> genus is known for its obligate mutualistic relationship with pollinating wasps, which is often considered an extreme example of plantâ€“animal coevolution [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Each fig species is typically pollinated by females of a single species-specific agaonid wasp (but see [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]), consequently providing oviposition sites for the pollinating wasp and food for its larvae. The short-lived pollen-carrying female wasps emerge from ripe figs and locate other receptive figs to lay eggs [

 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> species must provide oviposition sites. Indeed, fig tree populations have often been reported to be highly asynchronous and produce figs throughout the year [
