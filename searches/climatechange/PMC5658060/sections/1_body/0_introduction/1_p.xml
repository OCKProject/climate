<p class="p">Current climate changes induce markedly varying environmental changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], which increasingly affect ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. One of the most pronounced changes in the climate patterns is the increased frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], with a striking example being Taiwan, which experienced an average of 3.3 cyclones (called typhoons in the northwestern Pacific basin) annually before 2000, thereafter increasing to 5.7 typhoons annually [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Tropical cyclones markedly affect coastal environments by facilitating invasive species spread and indirectly increased the pressure on natural environments from human populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] as well as by reducing species biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]; overall, the amount of damage increases with the intensity and the frequency of tropical cyclones [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Typhoons play a critical role in the reproduction, regeneration, and succession of trees in tropical and subtropical forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, recently, global warming-induced extreme climate change has increased the frequency of severe typhoons that bring heavy rains and strong winds [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], thus considerably affecting the stability of forest ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>].
