 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Increased temperatures first cause a shift in the species distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and many more subtle changes in ecosystems. Among them, the effects on plant phenology involve an earlier flowering onset and a gap in flowering events in the middle of the year [

In concordance with the increased typhoon frequency, a meteorological data analysis revealed that during the past century, the average warming trend was stronger in Taiwan than that worldwide; between 1911 and 2009, the annual mean temperature increased by 1.4°C, which is equivalent to a warming rate of 0.14°C per decade, and for the past 30 years (1980–2009), it increased by 0.29°C per decade, which is more than twice the average rate in the past century [
