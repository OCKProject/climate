<p class="p">Plant phenology explores the relationship between seasonal meteorological procedures and plant activities such as leaf flushing and fruiting [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], the current global changes in the meteorological patterns are challenging research on plant phenology. Since the end of the last century, the number of studies on phenology and climate change published annually has increased almost 10 times [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Plant phenology is complex, and many reviews have provided a synthetic and potentially novel perspective on phenological studies conducted under climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], precipitation is extremely important in many ecosystems [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], with severe droughts occurring more frequently [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. A similar pattern was observed in the extreme south of Taiwan: less rain and increased drought frequency and temperatures [

Moreover, the shoreline of the Hengchun Peninsula forming the southern tip of Taiwan Island is partly composed of uplifted coral reef remnants reaching a maximum altitude of 10 m. The coral remnants are sharp and dark rocks, where very few plant species can grow, including two
