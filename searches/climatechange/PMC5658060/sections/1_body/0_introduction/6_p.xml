<p class="p">Regarding obligate mutualisms (Mearns fig and its associated pollinated wasp species), the damage engendered by typhoons is unknown. In this study, we focused on the Mearns fig population in the Hengchun Peninsula in the south of Taiwan after the occurrence of Typhoon Morakot. The phenology of both leaf and syconium abundance was observed over a 2-year survey period. This study was conducted to determine (1) the phenology of the Mearns fig immediately after the disturbance, (2) whether the phenology showed sexual differentiation during the recovery period, (3) the syconium reproductive strategy of male and female trees, and (4) the typhoon-induced damage in the mutualism. Our study explored the adaptive strategy of the Mearns fig in the harsh environment of coastal uplifted coral reef remnants.</p>
