<p class="p">The uplifted coral reef remnant shore in the extreme south of Taiwan is threatened by climate change. Indeed, local species grow in a harsh environment (hot and salty, with frequent droughts and low nutrient availability) at a very low altitude (less than 10 m) and the threat posed by sea-level rise and abnormal weather by climate change is real [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Typhoons considerably affect terrestrial ecosystems; therefore, the recovery ability of coastal plants after major meteorological disturbances must be investigated. For example, Typhoon Morakot (August 2009) induced the withering of most aboveground vegetation in coastal areas. 
 <italic class="italic">Ficus pedunculosa</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">mearnsii</italic> is probably well adapted to its environment as it colonized the uplifted coral reef remnant shore in the south of Taiwan. Nevertheless, this environment is considered harsh for the Mearns fig because it is part of an obligate mutualism and, to the contrary to the other local species that can produce flowers and fruits when the conditions are favorable, the Mearns fig trees have to produce figs to maintain their pollinating fig wasp population. Thus, the studied environment was considered as harsh for a
