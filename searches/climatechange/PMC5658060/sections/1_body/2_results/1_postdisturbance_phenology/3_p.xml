<p class="p">Three main A-phase syconium production periods (i.e., crop onsets) were defined in female trees: September 2009 to January 2010, June–August 2010, and April–June 2011 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186763.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref>). Each of these production periods was shorter and less fruitful than the previous period. Contrastingly, the production peaks in male trees occurred between September 2009 and March 2010 and May–August 2010, with two additional production peaks in October 2010 and May 2011 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186763.g004" class="xref">Fig 4B</xref>). The abundance of A-phase syconia and number of trees producing A-phase syconia did not significantly correlate with the meteorological factors (average temperature and rainfall) for both male and female trees (
