 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186763.g005" class="xref">Fig 5D and 5I</xref>). A total of 158 crops were recorded from 29 male trees [average: 5.2 ± 1.2 (mean ± standard deviation), range: 3–7], whereas 90 crops were produced by 21 female trees (average: 4.7 ± 1.0, range: 2–7;

The number of crops yielded by male and female trees was not significantly different (Mann–Whitney U test; U = 224 and p = 0.102), as was the total number of figs; however, the number of C-phase figs was significantly greater in male trees than in female trees (
