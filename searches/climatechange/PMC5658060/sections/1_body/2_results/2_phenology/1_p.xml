<p class="p">Leaf production and falling occurred throughout the year. After Typhoon Morakot, the trees recovered foliage; both male and female trees had a leaf production peak at the beginning of March 2010, followed by another peak in June (

Although the Mearns fig is a deciduous species, the period without leaves is short for each tree, and the trees produce leaves throughout the year. The production of leaves and number of senescent leaves were similar between male and female trees (
