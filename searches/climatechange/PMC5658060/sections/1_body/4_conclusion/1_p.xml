<p class="p">The rapid posttyphoon recovery of the Mearns fig under the harsh conditions of the Hengchun Peninsula coast reveals that the species is particularly well adapted to its environment. However, because of the increasing frequency of strong typhoons and increasing sea level, the recovery ability of the Mearns fig may not be sufficient. The

The entire distribution area of the Mearns fig has the same risks; therefore, the extinction risk extends to the entire variety. Because of climate change, the risk of extinction increases [
