<p class="p">According to Galil and Eisikowitch, syconium maturation occurs in five phases [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]: prefemale phase (A phase), female phase (B phase, receptive phase), interfloral phase (C phase), male phase (D phase), and mature phase (E phase). During the B phase, the female pollinating wasp enter the fig to pollinate the receptive female flowers inside. Then, the wasp larvae in male figs and the seeds in female figs mature during the C phase. At the end of the C phase, the wasps hatch, mate and exit the figs (D phase) or the figs ripen (E phase). The sexual functions of dioecious figs vary in trees; therefore, female figs have no D-phase figs and male figs have no E-phase figs.
