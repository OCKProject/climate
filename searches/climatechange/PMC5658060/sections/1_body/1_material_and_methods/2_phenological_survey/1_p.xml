<p class="p">The phenological survey of the Mearns fig was conducted from September 2009 to August 2011 at an interval of 10–22 days (average, 14.3 days). A total of 62 trees (33 and 29 male and female trees, respectively) were monitored, but four male and eight female trees died during the survey. Each tree had 2–10 marked branches of approximately 20 cm length: as the trees are tiny shrubs some individuals had few long enough branches. At each survey, the syconium abundance and developmental phases, as well as the number and category of the leaves (young, mature, or senescent), were recorded. A crop is defined by the production of figs from A-phase to the final phase of development. Thus, if a individual produces new figs over a long period it will have a long crop. On the other hand, if the A-phase production is interrupted two crops can overlap (see
