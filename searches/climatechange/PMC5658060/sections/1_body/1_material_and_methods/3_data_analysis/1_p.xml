<p class="p">A crop was defined as the succession of syconia from phase A to the final developmental phase. Trees can produce a new crop before the previous crop has completely developed; the new crop was noted as an overlapping crop. Furthermore, we defined seasons as spring (March–May), summer (June–August), fall (September–November), and winter (December–February).</p>
