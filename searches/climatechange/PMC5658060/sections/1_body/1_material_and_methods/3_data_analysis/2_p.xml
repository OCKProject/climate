<p class="p">We tested the possible correlations between the production of syconia and number of leaves in each survey by using the Kendall rank correlation test, as well as the meteorological factors (temperature and rainfall) and

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Subsequently, we calculated the ratio of the number of syconia and mature leaves on each branch (referred to as the fig:leaf ratio) to explore the relationship between syconium production and photosynthesis. The average fig:leaf ratio was then calculated for each tree. We used the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov Z test to compare the phenology of the figs and leaves and the fig:leaf ratio between male and female trees. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 12.0 (IBM SPSS Statistics, Chicago, IL, USA).
