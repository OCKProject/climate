 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> trees and their pollinators are bound together in an obligate mutualism with their associated pollinating wasp species, which lay eggs inside figs [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The lifespan of these tiny pollinators is up to a few days; therefore, the fig population cannot survive if the fig trees have the typical (mostly annual) reproductive phenology as do most angiosperm species. Many fig tree populations produce figs throughout the year [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. This feature permits the pollinating fig wasps to find receptive figs in range at any time (
