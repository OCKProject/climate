<p class="p">In contrast to previous studies, the present study determined that the recovery of the Mearns fig is mainly directed toward fruit production: After the typhoon, all the individuals started producing figs in addition to new leaves. After defoliation, the plant vegetative system must be rebuilt to produce carbon again. Therefore, plants mostly use their carbon reserves, which must be replenished later [

Indeed, the plant lives in a harsh environment, which provides few nutrients, but these fig trees still produce syconia at the earliest.
