<p class="p">Although the habitat of coastal uplifted coral reef remnants is harsh, various terrain anfractuosities would provide shelter for a few trees during typhoons, preventing some syconia and branches from being withered. Surviving C-phase syconia inhabited by pollinator larvae can be crucial for the local wasp population. However, with the increasing frequency of extreme events, the extinction risk of the local pollinated wasp population is increasing. Harrison et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>] reported withered fig trees with no syconia during the extreme drought following El Ni√±o in Borneo in 1998, and the local wasp population had disappeared. Because the frequency of typhoons has increased only since 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], the effects of typhoons on the fig population are still new and must be closely monitored. For example, the posttyphoon tree mortality and pollination rates are major factors to be surveyed.
