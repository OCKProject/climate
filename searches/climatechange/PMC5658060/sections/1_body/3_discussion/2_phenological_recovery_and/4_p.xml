<p class="p">Climate change strongly affects the uplifted coral reef remnant ecosystem of the Hengchun Peninsula. The aboveground vegetation was withered by Typhoon Morakot, and the posttyphoon days were severely dry and witnessed warm foehn-like winds [

Plants living in such harsh, uncertain environments have been selected for their ability to survive withering typhoons; however, because of global climate change, extreme events, such as strong typhoons and droughts, occurred increasingly and more powerfully [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In the case of the Mearns fig, the recovery ability of coastal plants after extreme events could be affected by the increased frequency of typhoons since 2000 (from 3.3 to 5.7 [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]); in particular, after the complete withering of the local figs, pollinators from another population are required for recolonization. However, how can recolonization occur when the entire distribution area of the species is disturbed by typhoons during the same season? For example, during the 2016 Pacific typhoon season, the path of category 5 Super Typhoon Meranti was extremely close to the Hengchun Peninsula and Batanes Islands in September, and the enormous Typhoon Megi passed by the eastern coast of Taiwan, potentially affecting the eastern and Green Island Mearns fig populations. These two typhoons came in the range of most Mearns fig populations, possibly affecting the recovery ability of the whole fig and pollinating wasp populations.
