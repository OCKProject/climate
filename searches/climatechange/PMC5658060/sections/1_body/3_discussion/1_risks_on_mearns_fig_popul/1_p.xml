<p class="p">In Taiwan, the Mearns fig population grows on the shoreline up to an altitude of 10 m. The number of individuals on Taiwan Island was less than 2000 in 2010 (Chiu &amp; Tzeng, unpublished data), and it was estimated to be nearly 200 on Orchid and Green Islands collectively. The Mearns fig population in Babuyan and Batanes Islands can be very roughly estimated between 2000 and 3000 individuals.</p>
