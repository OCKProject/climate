<p class="p">Typhoon waves exert devastating effects on coastal species. If these waves reach the vegetation, the direct kinetic effects and the effects of salty water can completely wither the coastal vegetation, with no recovery. For example, the waves of Typhoon Morakot reached a height of 11 m near the study site [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. However, most typhoons that passed Taiwan between 1995 and 1998 produced 8-m high waves [

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Considering the proximity of the Mearns fig population to the coastline and its elevation, any typhoon passing by the southern peninsula of Taiwan Island can be considered to result in disastrous consequences, possibly withering all the trees (

 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], 2.5 typhoons can be estimated to affect the Mearns fig population annually.
