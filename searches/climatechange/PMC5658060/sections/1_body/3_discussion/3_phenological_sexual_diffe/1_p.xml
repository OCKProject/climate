<p class="p">After Typhoon Morakot, many aspects of leaf and syconium production were similar between male and female trees, but male trees had more pollinated syconia than did female trees, resulting in varying fig:leaf ratios. Syconium and leaf production can be linked in 
 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic> species such as 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">septica</italic> from subgenus 
 <italic class="italic">Sycomorus</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tinctoria</italic> from subgenus 
 <italic class="italic">Sycidium</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. However, the Mearns fig belongs to the subgenus 
 <italic class="italic">Ficus</italic>, and contrastingly, leaf and syconium production are correlated in female trees but not in male trees. Moreover, female syconium production was correlated with rainfall. Syconium production is a carbon sink, particularly in female trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Female syconia are costlier to produce than male syconia. Therefore, female trees produce syconia in the best season of the year in many species [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] and also because they are not bound by the requirement of mutualism as are male trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0186763.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Specifically, male trees have to produce frequently to maintain the pollinating wasp population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186763.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). This constraint on male trees explains both the phenological difference with female trees and the rapid posttyphoon syconium production.
