<p id="Par10" class="p">This study used three national land cover maps (1993, 2002 and 2007) in vector format. The original classification includes more than 70 classes of land uses and covers, but these were aggregated into nine classes: temperate forest, scrubland, hydrophilic vegetation, agriculture, tropical evergreen forest, tropical dry forest, other vegetation such as palms, natural grasslands, and other covers including urban and barren lands.</p>
