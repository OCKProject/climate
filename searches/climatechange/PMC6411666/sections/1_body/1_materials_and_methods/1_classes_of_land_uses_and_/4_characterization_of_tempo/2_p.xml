<p id="Par14" class="p">All the predictor variables were categorized to estimate the effect of each one on a specific transition by calculating the probability of absence or presence (Goodacre et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">1993</xref>; Bonham-Carter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">1994</xref>). The categorization is based on an adaptation from Agterberg and Bonham-Carter’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1990</xref>) method, which consists of creating intervals for every transition, respecting the distribution of the data structure. The resulting ranges are the best fitting curve by straight-line segments that define the curve (Soares-Filho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2009</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">Weights of evidence</italic> (WofE) were calculated to evaluate the likelihood of LUCC for each predictor variable (Soares-Filho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2001</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2002</xref>). A positive value of WofE indicates that the relationship between a specific transition and the variable is stronger than would normally occur by chance; a negative value indicates that fewer observations occur than random processes. Absolute values from 0 to 0.5 are mildly predictive, from 0.5 to 1 are moderately predictive, from 1 to 2 are highly predictive, and ≥ 2 are extremely predictive (Agterberg and Bonham-Carter
