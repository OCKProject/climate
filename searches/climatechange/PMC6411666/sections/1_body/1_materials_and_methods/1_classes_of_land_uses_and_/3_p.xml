<p id="Par12" class="p">To assess the likely effect of climate change on LUCC processes, four coupled global atmosphere–ocean general circulation models, GCMs (HadCM3, CGCM2, MK2 and Nies 99), were considered. The selected climate variables were aridity index, potential evapotranspiration and temperature seasonality, all with a spatial resolution of 30 arc sec. Metzger et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2013</xref>) used these derived climate variables to reconstruct the different ecosystems and ecoregions; this performed better than inclusion of a larger non-processed climate data set, such as the one provided by BIOCLIM, and it explained &gt; 99.9% of the global environmental stratification. The environmental stratification based on these variables has shown high compatibility with other environmental stratifications such as the biomes used to underpin the World Wildlife Fund, ecoregions (Olson et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">2007</xref>). Also, these bioclimate indicators were directly related to plant physiological processes and primary productivity (Leathwick et al.
