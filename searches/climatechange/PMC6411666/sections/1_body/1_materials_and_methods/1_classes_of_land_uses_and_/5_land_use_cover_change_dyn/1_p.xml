<p id="Par17" class="p">This paper associates the socioeconomic drivers, the climate elements and the land use change in a single framework. It incorporates the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2000</xref>) because they are based on intrinsically linked storylines, socioeconomic projections and climate variables. This contrasts with the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) which were developed largely independently and may be integrated within several combinations (Kriegler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2012</xref>; van Vuuren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is important because different SSPs and the RCP combinations may build similar scenarios depending on contrasting assumption of land use trends, energy consumption and mitigation policies. In terms of climate, it can be linked to large rates of deforestation due to clearances for crops of biofuels (Popp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2017</xref>; Riahi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2017</xref>). Consequently, to keep a unifying storyline for this study, the LUCC projections were based on two assumptions regarding socioeconomic and climate change: a business as usual (BAU) scenario based on medium population and economic growth with medium rates of LUCC and B2 climate data (medium rate of change); and a pessimistic scenario based on high population growth and rates of LUCC, and low economic growth, which is in accordance with the A2 climate scenario assumptions (high rate of change). Finally, these scenarios were chosen according to the availability of information regarding bioclimate variables at fine spatial resolution (Metzger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2013</xref>).
