<p id="Par18" class="p">Projection of the assumptions of LUCC used a Markov change matrix and its modification. The BAU scenario used the rates of change and LUCC trajectories recorded for the period 1993–2002. However, for the pessimistic scenario, the magnitudes of the trajectories were adjusted particularly for the transitions to agriculture and other covers (urban). These modifications were based on the storylines and assumptions of the pessimistic scenario which includes a high population growth and slow growth of gross domestic product (GDP). These changes were incorporated in a lineal relationship to project their effects on areas of agricultural and urban lands. The LUCC model was then updated with the socioeconomic and climate variables for each scenario to simulate future land covers (2020, 2050 and 2080). Climate information was specific to each model and scenario (Table

The model was repeated using four GCMs (HadCM3, CGCM2, MK2 and Nies 99) for each time slice and scenario. More recent scenarios were not used, since the dates and models used in this study reflect current trends in population growth, environmental policies and socioeconomic conditions.
