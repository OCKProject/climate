<p id="Par19" class="p">The trained model was projected to the year 2007. The simulated map was validated to reflect the reliability of the model. A perfect simulation occurs when every grid cell is identical to the observed map (Pontius et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2001</xref>). The model was evaluated in terms of accuracy in location and in quantity of change between the observed and modelled maps for the year 2007. Model validation used two methods: 
 <italic class="italic">reciprocal similarity</italic> (Soares-Filho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">2009</xref>), a modification of the Kappa Fuzzy (Îº
 <italic class="italic">Fuzzy</italic>) proposed by Hagen (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2003</xref>), taking into account the fuzziness of location and category within a cell neighbourhood over different resolutions; and the 
 <italic class="italic">figure of merit</italic>, used to detect the differences and similarities between the evaluated maps and expressed as the percentage of the intersection of the observed and simulated changes of every cover in relation to its own area (Perica and Foufoula-Georgiou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">1996</xref>). If the model prediction is perfect, the figure of merit is 100%. On the contrary, if the prediction fails completely it is zero (Pontius et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2008</xref>). Based on the figures of merit, Pontius and Millones (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2011</xref>) proposed the concepts of agreement and disagreement in allocation and quantity between the observed and modelled maps; for this, quantity of disagreement is defined as the amount of difference between the observed map and a simulated map that is due to the less-than-perfect match in the proportions of the categories. Allocation disagreement is defined as the amount of difference between the observed and the simulated maps in the spatial allocation of the categories, given the proportions of the categories in the two maps. For more details about these indexes, refer to Pontius and Millones (
