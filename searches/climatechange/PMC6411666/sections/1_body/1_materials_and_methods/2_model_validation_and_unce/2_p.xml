<p id="Par20" class="p">The uncertainty of the resulting maps was evaluated by quantifying the agreement between the four maps (one for each GCM) for each scenario and time frame. This agreement ranked from 0 to 100, wherein a value of 100 was for cells in which the four GCMs projected the same transition or permanence, a value of 75 where three out of four models coincided and 50 where only two models showed an agreement in the modelled transitions. Consequently, it was possible to assess the performance of the model with the different GCMs for the LUCC trajectories.</p>
