<p id="Par27" class="p">The similarity index suggests that the simulated and observed maps reached 70% of the similarity within a window of three cells and 90% within nine cells. According to the figures of merit (Pontius et al.

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Scrubland and tropical dry forest were the natural covers that showed the highest performance in modelling.
