<p id="Par28" class="p">The model suggests differences in the LUCC projections across the Mexican territory. The LUCC models generally agreed among the different GCMs in the northwest of the country and the northern lowlands. However, there was greater disagreement among the GCMs with regard to the Yucatan Peninsula, in the south of the country, and to the Southern Pacific Coast in the states of Michoacán, Guerrero, Oaxaca, and Chiapas, especially by 2080 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). For 2020, there was 100% agreement in 82% (BAU) and 86% (pessimistic scenario) of the total area, but this agreement had decreased by 2050 to 78% (BAU) and 80% (pessimistic scenario), and by 2080 to 73% and 74%.
