<p id="Par24" class="p">Topographical features, such as slope and altitude, were the main factors affecting the location of the deforestation. Agricultural expansion occurred mainly on gentle slopes and at the lower limit of the natural altitudinal distribution. For example, deforestation of temperate forest was strongly associated with slopes ≤ 2° (WofE = 2.2) and with altitudes &lt; 500 m a.s.l. (WofE = 3.6, Table

For example, sites with low potential evapotranspiration (&lt; 1000) were strongly related to change from temperate forest (WofE = 1.9) and grassland (WofE = 1.3) to agricultural land (Table

Areas with less aridity (more water availability) were more prone to change to agricultural cover, especially from scrubland and grassland (Table
