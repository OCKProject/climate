<p id="Par22" class="p">During the period 1993–2002, loss of area was greatest in temperate forest (1204 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>), scrubland (1097 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and tropical dry forest (980 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). As a function of the area in 1993, temperate forest by 2002 had lost 3.1%, tropical dry forest 3.8% and tropical evergreen forest 4.1% (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). During 2002–2007, loss of area was greatest in natural grassland (1170 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and tropical dry forest (1163 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and this was also the largest proportional loss (4.6% of grassland and 2.6% of tropical dry forest) in relation to their extent in 1993 (Fig.
