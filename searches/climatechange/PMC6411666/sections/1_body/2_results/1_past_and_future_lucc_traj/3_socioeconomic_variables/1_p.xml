<p id="Par23" class="p">Deforestation was principally related to socioeconomic variables. In temperate forest and scrubland, the most important socioeconomic variables related to the LUCC processes were distance from human settlements and roads followed by population density, GDP and marginalization (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). In contrast, transition to agricultural land from grassland was more closely associated with biophysical variables (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Regarding the relative WofE by ranges, distance from human settlements (&lt; 2 km) was strongly correlated with changes to agricultural area. This relationship was found in temperate forest, scrubland, tropical dry forest and grassland (WofE &gt; 1.0) (Table

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1085-0" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S1</ext-link>). Population density (&lt; 200 inhabitants km
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) was linked to conversion from temperate forest and tropical dry forest (WofE = 0.86 and 1.8) to agricultural land, whereas at higher population densities (≥ 500 inhabitants km
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) the strong link was to conversion from tropical evergreen forest and scrubland (WofE = 1.9 and 2.5) (Table 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1085-0" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</ext-link>). The National Index of Marginalization was also a significant factor in agricultural and urban expansion. Municipalities with medium and high marginalization were associated with agricultural expansion in temperate forest, tropical evergreen forest and tropical dry forest (WofE ≥ 0.60, Table 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-018-1085-0" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">S2</ext-link>), whereas municipalities with very low or low marginalization favoured urban sprawl (WofE = 0.90 and 1.44). GDP and GDP per capita were similarly influential. For example, poor municipalities (GDP 400–2500 million Mexican pesos) undertook more transitions to agricultural land, whereas richer municipalities (&gt; 5100 million Mexican pesos) were related to the expansion of urban cover. Protected areas were effective in restricting change to agricultural activities in tropical evergreen forest (WofE = 1.86). Proximity to rivers had little influence on expansion of agricultural activities (WofE ≤ 0.41, Table
