 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. By 2050, the area of grassland would be only 43% of its area in 1993, and tropical evergreen forest would cover 4.7% (BAU) or 3.9% (pessimistic scenario) of the land, suggesting a reduction of between 20 and 33%. By 2080, under the pessimistic scenario, tropical evergreen forest may account for only 2.5% of Mexico, i.e. 45% less than its extent in 1993 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). By 2050, agricultural land would increase from 24.4% in 1993 to 30% (BAU) or 34% (pessimistic scenario), suggesting that by 2080 31–42% of Mexico could be dominated by anthropogenic covers (Fig.
