<p id="Par35" class="p">Diverse biophysical variables can influence LUCC processes in Mexico over various spatial scales (Kolb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2013</xref>). The present study supports the conclusion from a study performed at local scale (Corona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>) that lower altitudes and gentle slopes favour transition to agricultural and other covers such as cities. Other biophysical variables, such as the aridity index and the potential evapotranspiration influence the extent to which agricultural land is established and expanded (Zomer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, water availability (low potential evapotranspiration and high aridity index) was the main factor correlated to agricultural expansion. This explains why most of the deforestation was observed in the dry sub-humid and humid areas, which in turn can be related with the relationship between low production yields and water stress (Bannayan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, national studies should investigate the connections among climate variables, management and production yields to implement appropriate strategies of mitigation and adaptation under climate change conditions (Pittelkow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2014</xref>) with particular focus on temperate and arid and semiarid ecosystems (Leemans and Eickhout 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2004</xref>).
