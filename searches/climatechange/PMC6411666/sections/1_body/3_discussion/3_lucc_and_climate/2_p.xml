<p id="Par36" class="p">The pessimistic scenario poses the greater challenge not only because of the new climate conditions but also due to the increasing demands of a growing population. Scrubland will expand to the detriment of temperate forest and natural grassland, as has happened in California (Shaw et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2011</xref>). This might reinforce the LUCC processes in suitable (more humid) ecosystems, particularly to establish agricultural practices. Therefore, water availability will be the major driver of Mexican agriculture, which in turn would influence the LUCC processes. Further studies should focus on yields and their relationship to LUCC and biophysical variables. This will help to improve agricultural management in specific areas such as the semiarid region (Herrera-Pantoja and Hiscock
