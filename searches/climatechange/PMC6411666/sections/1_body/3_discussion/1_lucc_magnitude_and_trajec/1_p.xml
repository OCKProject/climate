<p id="Par29" class="p">LUCC and climate change are major drivers of global environmental change. They modify the distribution and fragmentation of the natural vegetation and thereby affect environmental services and biodiversity. Annual rates of deforestation in Mexico dropped by 50% during 2010–2015, in contrast to increases in some other countries, particularly those associated with the expansion of soy crops and pasture for cattle (Gollnow and Lakes

The reduction of forest loss in Mexico shows a pattern similar to the forest recovery in other regions in Latin America, where forest recovery may be favoured by socioeconomic factors such as international remittances, migration, urban/rural population change, rural abandonment and accompanying urbanization and industrialization (Aide and Grau
