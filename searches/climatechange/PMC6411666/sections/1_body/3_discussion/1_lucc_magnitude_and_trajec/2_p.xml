<p id="Par30" class="p">Deforestation rates can hide important losses, particularly those related to the heterogeneity of the LUCC process. For example, during the period 1993–2002, temperate forests and scrublands showed the largest losses. Grasslands and tropical evergreen forests showed the highest proportional loss in relation to their extent in 2007. Since scrubland and grasslands are not considered as forest (FAO
