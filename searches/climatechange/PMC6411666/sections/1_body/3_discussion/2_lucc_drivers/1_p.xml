<p id="Par31" class="p">Agricultural expansion affects the natural ecosystems in Mexico (Palacio-Prieto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2000</xref>). Diversity in deforestation patterns across the country is related to cultural and socioeconomic activities that differ among ecosystems (Burgos and Maass 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2004</xref>). In Mexico the spread of agriculture is mainly for subsistence (SAGARPA and FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2012</xref>), whereas in the Amazon region and Southeast Asia commercial agriculture for international markets is the main driver of deforestation (Hosonuma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2012</xref>). Over the past 30 years, industrialized society on the global scale has been experiencing a new model of economic growth whose core aim was to foster a culture of freedom based on technological innovations, resource extraction and entrepreneurship (i.e. open ecology sources, intensive agriculture) (Petropulou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2016</xref>). According to Castells et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2012</xref>), industrialized society has somehow favoured the waves of deregulation, privatization and liberalization, which have been the main objectives of the neo-liberal agenda since the 1980s, and which have disproportionately affected poorer and more marginalized people (Petropulou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2016</xref>). Therefore, socioeconomic forces such as population density (Mas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2009</xref>), incomes (Vaca et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2012</xref>; Corona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>), marginalization and distance from currently existing land uses and covers can be important forces of local and regional LUCC (Sahagún-Sánchez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>; Kolb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2013</xref>). The results of the present study suggest that agricultural expansion is driven by medium to high marginalization, as has also been found in San Luis Potosí, central Mexico (Sahagún-Sánchez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2011</xref>) and southern states such as Oaxaca, Veracruz and Chiapas (Bonilla-Moheno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2012</xref>; Corona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>). Rates of transition from forest to agriculture can be high in areas with medium population density. According to Corona et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>), agricultural expansion, mainly for subsistence, is observed in poor municipalities with rural communities, and these tend to have low and medium population densities.
