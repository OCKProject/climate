<p id="Par34" class="p">In Mexico, human settlements are embedded at all scales in forested areas (García-Barrios et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2009</xref>). Access to forested areas along roads is among the most significant factors contributing to deforestation across the tropics. Regions with high accessibility to forests and high population densities have reduced areas of primary forest, often limited to mountainous regions (Porter-Bolland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2007</xref>; Corona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>). In all ecosystems, proximity to roads, rivers and human settlements favours change to agricultural activities. Social and economic driving forces include the low profitability and productivity of farming, and new transport infrastructure and especially roads, which have rapidly altered many rural landscapes (Caraveli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2000</xref>; Petropulou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2016</xref>). Consequently, the creation of roads or their improvement is associated with forest loss, reduction of transport costs and increased access to markets. Therefore, further studies should look into the role of the socioeconomic drivers to understand the spatio-temporal dynamics of the LUCC. Answering questions such as: Do the road expansion and GDP are causes or consequences of agricultural and urban sprawl? In contrast, conservation policies such as the presence of protected areas hinder change to agricultural cover, especially in tropical evergreen forest (Figueroa and Sánchez-Cordero 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, national protected areas have not been sufficient to preserve the remnants of the ecosystems, which have been significantly and continuously reduced (Flamenco-Sandoval et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2007</xref>). Also, conservation policies must take into account other ecosystems such as tropical dry forest or scrubland, which are under-represented in the natural protected areas (Koleff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2009</xref>).
