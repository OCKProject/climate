<p id="Par33" class="p">In identifying the causes of deforestation and the influence of climate change and socioeconomic factors, it is necessary to prioritize the hotspots of change. LUCC processes differ across Mexico. For example, the reduction in deforestation in northern areas (Chihuahua and Coahuila) noted here and by Bonilla-Moheno et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2012</xref>) may be because the North American Free Trade Agreement between Mexico, the USA and Canada has encouraged the inhabitants to engage in the textile industry rather than in agriculture (Currit and Easterling

On the other hand, in municipalities with higher levels of GDP a reduction in agricultural expansion was accompanied by expansion of human settlements and urban areas. Poorer states such as Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas are expected to increase their population, but without any associated economic growth. This will increase pressure on the ecosystems, especially in tropical dry forests (Corona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2016</xref>) and tropical evergreen forests linked with past and probable future deforestation rates. Therefore, to identify the most profitable agricultural practices to decrease deforestation and allow forest recovery it is necessary to build proposals that include multiple feedbacks among urbanization, industrialization, market-oriented agricultural production and industry-based agro-technology (Garc√≠a-Barrios et al.
