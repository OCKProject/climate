<p id="Par7" class="p">Deforestation processes change over time and space. They are related to underlying causes such as economic, demographic, technological, cultural and political factors (Veldkamp and Lambin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2001</xref>; Geist and Lambin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2002</xref>). Global drivers of agricultural expansion are related to population growth, changing diets, animal feed and fuel consumption (Foley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2011</xref>; Alexander et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, globalization has caused the effects of LUCC processes to differ between countries and within their borders, because of the differences between the location of food and wood production and their consumption (Lambin and Meyfroidt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2011</xref>). For example, although tropical regions have become some of the greatest emitters of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> due to LUCC processes (Houghton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2012</xref>), especially from agriculture (Laurance et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2014</xref>), European countries import large quantities of agricultural products (Porkka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2017</xref>).
