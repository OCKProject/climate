<p id="Par9" class="p">Mexico is one of the countries with the greatest extent of natural vegetation (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2015</xref>), and one of the 5 out of the 17 richest countries in terms of biological diversity and endemism (Mittermeier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">1997</xref>). However, the forest and biodiversity are at risk due to deforestation (e.g. during 2010–2015 the deforestation affected 72 200 ha year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) (FAO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2015</xref>). In Mexico there are two principal agricultural management practices: (1) high-technology agriculture linked to industrialized centres and urban areas, and (2) traditional agriculture associated with marginalized communities (López et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2001</xref>; Currit and Easterling 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2009</xref>). These constitute a complex framework which makes Mexico an interesting case in understanding the deforestation processes with regard to socioeconomic change and climate change in complex and heterogeneous territories. Therefore, the aims of this study are to contextualize the drivers of change and to determine the hotspots of LUCC under different socioeconomic and climate change scenarios in the short, medium and long term for Mexico. To achieve this goal, two key questions were developed: (1) What are the main drivers of LUCC in Mexico? (2) What ecosystems will be the most threatened by LUCC under diverse socioeconomic conditions and climate change scenarios?
