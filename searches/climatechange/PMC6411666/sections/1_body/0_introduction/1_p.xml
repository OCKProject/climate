<p id="Par6" class="p">Land use cover change (LUCC) is the physical expression of human impacts on the landscape. Drivers of LUCC vary in magnitude and location, affecting differentially the processes and patterns of the earthâ€™s surface. An understanding of the socio-ecological drivers of change and how they impact the land systems is necessary to perceive how these changes might affect the system and their tradeoffs (Verburg et al.
