<p id="Par8" class="p">In Latin America, most agricultural production is destined for domestic markets (Meyfroidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2013</xref>). Therefore, spatially explicit land use models that incorporate the proximate causes of LUCC require an understanding of the agricultural spatial patterns and their dynamics (Veldkamp and Lambin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2001</xref>; Verburg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2002</xref>). In this context, LUCC models contribute to an understanding of complex socio-ecological systems. These models monitor areas and types of changes which can be incorporated to quantify and qualify the impacts of LUCC on carbon emissions (Houghton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2012</xref>), climate (Feddema et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2005</xref>), ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation (Wu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2013</xref>). Also, these models identify spatially the drivers of LUCC and magnitude and intensity of the effects; this information can influence policies for ecosystems management. Consequently, national, regional and local studies are needed to improve the understanding of the LUCC and their effects.
