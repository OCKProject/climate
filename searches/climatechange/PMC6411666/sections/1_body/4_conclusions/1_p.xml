<p id="Par37" class="p">This study is the first at national level in Mexico that integrates the major drivers of environmental change to quantify the historical and future impacts of LUCC under socioeconomic and climate change scenarios. The result of this work provides spatial information to identify the hotspots of LUCCs. It can guide strategies for biodiversity or ecosystem services conservation through spatial prioritization. Temperate forest, natural grassland and tropical evergreen forest will be the land covers most affected by LUCC. Moreover, tropical dry forest and natural grassland will also be endangered as a result of lack of adequate policies for their conservation because these natural covers are under-represented in the national protected areas. Socioeconomic elements, such as proximity to human settlements or roads, and biophysical variables such as altitude, slope and potential evapotranspiration influence agricultural expansion. Further studies at regional or local scales should incorporate spatial information about migration from rural areas to cities, which could lead to the abandonment of agricultural land and hence to the regeneration of ecosystems.</p>
