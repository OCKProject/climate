  <title class="title">Percentege of bird and mammal populations that show different temporal responses in body size, taking into account 
   <italic class="italic">(a)</italic> only the sign of the changes (upper panels), and 
   <italic class="italic">(b)</italic> the statistical significance of the changes (lower panels).
  </title>
  <p class="p">Data were analyzed separately for trend and significance because statistical significance depends on sample size (which varies from case to case), and also because some studies only report the sign of the temporal trend, while other studies only report that changes were not significant (see
