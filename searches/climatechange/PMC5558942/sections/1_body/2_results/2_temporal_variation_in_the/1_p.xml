<p class="p">As mentioned above, the rate of change in global temperature was greater for the second half of the 20

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183051.g003" class="xref">Fig 3a</xref>). In line with this, we found that before 1950 two terrestrial bird species showed a significant increase in body mass, twelve species showed no significant changes in size, and three species showed a significant decrease in body mass (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). However, after 1950 we found that eight species showed a significant decrease in body mass, while the remaining nine species showed no significant correlation between body mass and year of collection (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). Accordingly, the mean value of r
 <sub class="sub">year</sub> differed between both periods of time (t
 <sub class="sub">16</sub> = 2.46, P = 0.03), being very close to zero for the first half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>century (X = -0.01, SD = 0.16) and negative for the second half of this century (X = -0.14, SD = 0.12). In the same vein, phylogenetic analyses indicate that regression coefficient for the year of collection did not differ from zero for the first half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, but was negative and highly significant for the second half of that century (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183051.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, the distribution of the difference of the regression coefficients for the year of collection between both periods of time (“after 1950” minus “before 1950”) was negative and statistically significant (
