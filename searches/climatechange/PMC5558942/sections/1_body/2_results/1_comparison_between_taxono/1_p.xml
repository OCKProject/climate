<p class="p">Overall, six species increased their body mass, 21 species showed no significant changes in size, and 17 species decreased their body mass during the 20th century (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). The correlation between body mass and year of collection (r
 <sub class="sub">year</sub>) was similar for birds and mammals (ANOVA: F
 <sub class="sub">1,40</sub> = 1.38, P = 0.25; ANCOVA: F

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183051.g002" class="xref">Fig 2a</xref>), but it strongly differs between aquatic and terrestrial species (ANOVA: F
 <sub class="sub">1,40</sub> = 27.1, P &lt; 0.001; ANCOVA: F

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183051.g002" class="xref">Fig 2a</xref>). Taken together, data for birds and mammals indicate that: (1) of 14 aquatic species, five showed a significant increase, eight showed a non-significant correlation, and one showed a significant decrease in body mass during the 20th century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183051.g002" class="xref">Fig 2b</xref>); (2) of 30 terrestrial species, 16 showed a significant decrease, 13 showed a non-significant correlation, and one showed a significant increase in body mass during the 20th century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183051.g002" class="xref">Fig 2b</xref>). That is, while most aquatic species increased or did not change body mass through the 20th century, most terrestrial species decreased in size. In line with these results, phylogenetic analyses indicate that, in addition to latitude and sex, there is a significant effect of the year of collection in all the models (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183051.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In addition, the model that included an interaction term between year of collection and habitat (model C) showed the best fit to the data (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183051.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and this interaction was significant, indicating again the contrasting pattern of variation between aquatic and terrestrial species.
