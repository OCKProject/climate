<p class="p">Within this context, we assessed temporal change in body mass for 27 bird and 17 mammal species to evaluate if a reduction in body size during the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, whatever its causes and mechanistic basis, is a widespread phenomenon among endothermic vertebrates. In addition, we tested whether there are differences in the temporal response between: (1) birds and mammals, (2) aquatic and terrestrial species, and (3) the first and second half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that: (i) simultaneously assesses temporal changes in body size for birds and mammals, using the same methodology to analyze both taxonomic groups and accounting for the effect of phylogeny, and (ii) evaluates differences in the temporal responses between aquatic and terrestrial species.
