<p class="p">Several studies have claimed that a reduction in body size comprises the third universal ecological response to global warming, after species distributional shifts and phenological changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. For the particular case of endothermic species, two non-mutually exclusive ideas are usually invoked to explain this phenomenon [

 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. First, a rise in ambient temperature may cause a reduction in body size due to energetic considerations –i.e., smaller size implies a larger surface to volume ratio and is “better” for heat dissipation in warmer climates– in line with Karl Bergmann’s famous argument [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Second, a decrease in resource availability (or quality) could cause a reduction in the rate of growth throughout an animal’s development, resulting in a smaller adult size. As for the mechanistic basis of these changes, two non-mutually exclusive explanations are usually advanced: a plastic response at the individual level [

 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and genetic changes at the population level [

 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Even though very few studies have evaluated the relative weight of these two mechanisms, current evidence suggests that phenotypic plasticity usually accounts for a higher portion, if not for all, of the overall phenotypic change [
