<p class="p">The second result, in our opinion, is the most interesting outcome of the present study. In short, we found that while most of the aquatic species increased or did not change in body mass through the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, most terrestrial species decreased in size. We believe that this is not the consequence of a single physiological or ecological factor acting differentially between the two habitats, but the result of an imbalance in the number of factors promoting increase and decrease in size between aquatic and terrestrial systems. In addition, given that species classified as aquatic in the present study range from semi-aquatic to fully aquatic, the relevance of each factor enlisted below could change to a greater extent according to the biology of individual species. First, the fact that water thermal conductivity is about 23 times greater than air thermal conductivity means that thermal stability is much greater in aquatic than in terrestrial systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Consequently, extreme events during which ambient temperature rises above the upper limit of the thermoneutral zone –which usually is between 30°C and 40°C [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]–could be fairly common on land but rare in aquatic habitats (and surely nonexistent in aquatic habitats at higher latitudes). Along these lines, a decrease in body size due to the energetic argument depicted by Bergmann [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] is not expected for most aquatic species. Interestingly, an increase in body size related to a rise in the number of extremely hot days, due to a positive relationship between size and water conservation ability, also has been proposed for terrestrial birds, but only for some species inhabiting arid environments [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Second, the greater thermal conductivity of water, when combined with the fact that mean ambient temperatures usually are below the lower limit of the thermoneutral zone [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], implies that the costs of maintenance usually are higher in aquatic endotherms than in terrestrial ones [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Then, even a slight rise in water temperature could represent an important savings in the amount of energy needed for thermoregulation, and thus, an increase in the amount of energy that aquatic species could devote to body growth [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Third, given that growth rate in primary producers is positively related to ambient temperature, global warming is expected to result in an increase in net primary productivity (NPP, a rough proxy of overall food availability in a system). However, the real effect of temperature on NPP usually changes between geographic areas, depending on water availability in terrestrial systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and on nutrient availability (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorous) in aquatic systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. In this sense, while terrestrial species in our data set belong to areas that strongly differ in water availability (from desert to boreal forest), practically all the aquatic species occur in high latitude coastal and inland systems, where a positive effect of temperature on NPP is expected [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Thus, at least in our study, temporal changes in food availability probably differed among terrestrial species, but consistently increased for aquatic species. Fourth, the reduction in the mean body size recently recorded for several fish assemblages, due to size-at-age, population age-structure, and species compositional shifts [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], may have led to an increase in the number of prey types consumed by aquatic birds and mammals. In addition, the reduction in the abundance of larger individuals of some large species of fish, mostly caused by human exploitation (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]), may also reduce the selective pressure of competition acting on some aquatic endotherms (e.g., large predators). Finally, habitat fragmentation heavily impacts terrestrial systems and is expected to negatively affect body size, because home range directly affects the amount of resources available to each species [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Thus, we believe that differences in the factors favoring increases and decreases in body size between aquatic and terrestrial habitats could be responsible for the dissimilar pattern of body size change. However, research aimed at testing this idea is necessary, especially because relatively few aquatic species have been analyzed.
