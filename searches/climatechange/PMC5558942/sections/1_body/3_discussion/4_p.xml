<p class="p">Finally, we found that temporal decrease in body size for terrestrial birds was noticeably greater during the second half than during the first half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. In effect, both conventional and phylogenetic analyses indicate that mean slope value between body mass and year of collection was very close to zero for the first half of 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, but negative for the second half of that century. Although seldom explored, temporal variation in body size changes should be expected because global warming, as well as other anthropogenic modifications of habitats (fragmentation, pollution, etc), increased noticeably after 1950. Thus, our results reinforce the idea that, at least for some groups of animals, human activities are behind the recorded changes in body size patterns (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]). Nevertheless, further investigations are needed to understand how human-caused phenotypic changes are linked to population process, and hence, to know if they really comprise a useful piece of information when assessing “health status” at the population or species levels (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]). The vast digital resource on trait variability now available through on-line museum databases provides opportunities to explore the effects of environmental change on diverse organisms [
