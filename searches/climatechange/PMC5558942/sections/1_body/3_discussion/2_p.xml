<p class="p">The first result is interesting because previously published data suggest that significant reductions in body size appear to be more common in birds, while significant increases in size appear to be more common in mammals [

However, in contrast to our study in which aquatic species represent 32% of species, previous works were conducted almost exclusively on terrestrial species (&gt; 95%). Thus, it could be possible that the discrepancy between our study and previous works is related to a difference in the relative number of species that occur in aquatic habitats. In this sense, a close inspection of our results for terrestrial species indicates that the proportion of species that showed a significant reduction in body size is higher in birds (64.7%) than in mammals (38.5%). We think that this taxonomic difference in terrestrial habitat could be related to differences in biology and especially linked to the energetic argument. That is, because birds have higher metabolic rates for a given body mass than mammals [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], the selective pressure for increasing heat dissipation abilities (i.e., smaller sizes) could be higher in the former group.
