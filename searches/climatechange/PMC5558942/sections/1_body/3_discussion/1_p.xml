<p class="p">Importantly, nearly all the data considered in our analyses are from specimens from the middle and high latitudes along the west coast and western North American sub-continent (Figure D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). Although this fact may constrain generalization of our results, ambient temperature in this area has increased between 1°C and 2°C through the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup>century [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Thus, the changes in body size that were observed here could be linked, at least in theory, to direct and indirect effects of changes in ambient temperature. Three major results emerge from the present study. First, only subtle (non significant) differences in the temporal changes in body mass between birds and mammals were observed. Second, temporal changes in body mass recorded for aquatic species were different from those recorded for terrestrial species. Third, the temporal reduction in body size observed in terrestrial birds was greater for the second half of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century than for the first half.
