<p class="p">To assess temporal change in body size, we downloaded data on body mass for endothermic vertebrates, with the exception of rodents and passerine birds due to logistic constraints (i.e., our inability to curate two datasets with several thousands of records) from Arctos, an online natural history database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.arctos.database.museum" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.arctos.database.museum</ext-link>). We included all species with more than 100 geo-referenced records of sexed individuals, covering the last four decades at least. We excluded six species for which most of the data (&gt; 80%) span &lt; 10 years of collection (Figure A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>), and removed 26 outlier records corresponding to very small individuals, in which body mass was close to zero. Those selection criteria yielded a total of 20,496 records belonging to 44 species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s003" class="xref">S2 Dataset</xref>). These species were then classified, based on information provided by IUCN (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.iucnredlist.org/</ext-link>), Birdlife International (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://animaldiversity.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://animaldiversity.org/</ext-link>), as aquatic, if they inhabit fresh water and/or marine habitats in addition to terrestrial ones (birds: n = 10, mammals: n = 4), or terrestrial, if they only inhabit terrestrial habitats (birds: n = 17, mammals: n = 13). By analyzing multiple populations of each species over broad geographical areas (see Figure B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>), our analysis intended to identify responses at the species level, rather than local responses at the population level. Also, our analysis assumed that the effects of several factors that could affect body mass and that we cannot filter statistically (e.g., age of each individual, season of the year, time of the day of capture, people taking the measurements) are randomly distributed among years.
