<p class="p">We estimated the partial correlation coefficient between body mass and the year of collection (r
 <sub class="sub">year</sub>) for each species separately, through conventional linear regression models, using (absolute) latitude, longitude, and sex as covariates in the models. Then, we evaluated differences in r
 <sub class="sub">year</sub> between taxonomic groups (i.e., birds or mammals) and species habitats (i.e., aquatic or terrestrial) using a two-way ANOVA. The correlation coefficient between body mass and the year of collection (r
 <sub class="sub">year</sub>) was not correlated with sample size, species body mass, or species distribution, but was correlated with the length of the time series (r = 0.36, P = 0.02). Hence, in addition to the ANOVA, we also ran an ANCOVA using the length of time series as a covariate. In these analyses, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess normality, Levene’s test to assess homogeneity of variance, and (in ANCOVA) a parallelism test to assess the interaction between factors and the covariate. All these analyses were done with Statistica (version 8.0) software [
