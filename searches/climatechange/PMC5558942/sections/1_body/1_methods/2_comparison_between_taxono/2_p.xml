<p class="p">To take into account phylogenetic relationships among species, the relationship between body mass and the year of collection was also evaluated using a phylogenetic generalized linear mixed model (PGLMM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], with species as a random factor, taxonomic group and habitat as fixed factors, and (absolute) latitude, longitude, sex and length of the time series as covariates (model A). To consider potential interactions between the year of collection and fixed factors, we ran two additional models: one including the interaction term with taxonomic group (model B) and the other including the interaction term with habitat (model C). In all these models, species body mass was standardized to a mean equal to zero and variance equal to one. The phylogenetic tree used in these analyses (Figure C in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183051.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>) was based on previously published papers for birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] and mammals [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Given that branch length is not known for this tree, we set all lengths to one. Phylogenetic analyses were run with the MCMCglmm package [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] in the free software R [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Inferences for each regression model were based on 200,000 samples, obtained after discarding 50,000 samples as burn in. In all models, default priors were used for “fixed” effects, while inverse Wishart priors with scale parameter equal to half of dependent variable variance (and 3 degrees of freedom) were used for “random" effects. A thinning interval of 100 was used for computing features of the posterior distribution. Convergence diagnostics, statistical and graphical analyses of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling output were carried out with the CODA package [
 <xref rid="pone.0183051.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] available in R. Finally, the significance of each regression coefficient was estimated from Markov chain Monte Carlo p-value (pMCMC), which basically represents (2x) the proportion of posterior values that are of the opposite sign to the parameter estimate, whereas the fit of each model to the data was assessed through Deviance Information Criterion (DIC scores).
