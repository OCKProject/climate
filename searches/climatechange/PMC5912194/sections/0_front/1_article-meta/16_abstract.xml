 <p class="p">The goal of this cross-sectional qualitative study was to assess the impact of climate change on S치mi youth health, health care access, and health-seeking behaviour. Indigenous research methodology served as the basis of the investigation which utilised focus groups of youths and one-on-one interviews of adult community leaders using a semi-structured, open-ended questions. The results of the focus groups and interviews were then analysed to identify trends. We found that S치mi youth mostly associate the implications of climate change to their culture andcultural practices rather than the historical influence the environment had on S치mi health. They also take part in unique health-seeking behaviour by utilising both traditional and Western medicine simultaneously but without interaction due to social and structural factors. Our findings suggest that the health of S치mi teens is not tied to the environment directly, but through cultural activities.</p>
