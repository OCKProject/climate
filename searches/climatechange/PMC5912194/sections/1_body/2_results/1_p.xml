<p class="p">The results of this study indicated that climate change has an impact on Sámi health, notably, that those individuals involved in reindeer herding, or hoping to be involved in the future, are particularly susceptible to be negatively impacted by climate change by increased safety issues (such as less stable ice and snow routes) or through anxiety. Anxiety tied to climate change was quite commonly described and tended to be related to cultural continuity, especially the feasibility and opportunity for economic development of reindeer herding in the future.

  <p class="p">“The constant worry is also about the weather, the animals, and the windmills [and how it affects] the family that cares for reindeer…. It’s a lot of stress… I mentioned earlier that our whole life is [centered] around the reindeer and how everything that happens affects the reindeer. From people walking in the mountain to expropriation to weather to cabins being built to the mining industry, everything. It’s always about how does this affect the reindeers.” (edited for clarity)</p>
