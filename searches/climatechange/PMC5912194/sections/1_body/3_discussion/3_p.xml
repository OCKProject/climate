<p class="p">Unlike the impacts of globalisation and climate change on culture, Sámi youth had difficulty identifying the impacts of global forces on their health. This suggests that the Sámi no longer define their health in the context of the environment like they did around 100 years ago [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" class="xref">12</xref>]. Instead, they seem to have adapted to the Norwegian health system and health-based beliefs. Therefore, what is and what is not good health is no longer dictated by Sámi culture, but rather, the concept of health has been adapted from Norwegian society while certain aspects of Sámi healing culture have remained as a form of expression of traditional Sámi culture. As a result, culture is the main vehicle by which climate change impacts the Sámi.
