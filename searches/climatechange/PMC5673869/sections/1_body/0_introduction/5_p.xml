<p id="Par16" class="p"> In this article, we provide an overview on some of the contributions from ACCESS to those objectives with an emphasis on the cross-sectoral perspective. A full list of ACCESS publication as of autumn 2017 can be found in 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13280-017-0953-3" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Supplementary material S1</ext-link>. The project provided contributions related to the impacts of climate change on the natural environment in the Arctic. Some examples include new direct and satellite-based observations of sea-ice properties (Hwang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" class="xref">2015</xref>; Divine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" class="xref">2016</xref>), atmospheric conditions (Gascard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref> and references therein) and sea state (Dmitrenko et al. 2014; Oziel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2016</xref>); development of a method to design better observation networks (Kaminski et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015</xref>); data analysis and modelling to improve scenarios of future sea ice and ocean (Gascard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" class="xref">2012</xref>; Gascard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>). The project used much of these findings to inform studies on the impacts of climate change on society including costs and benefits of off-shore resource extraction (Petrick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2017</xref>), tourism, marine transportation, salmon (
 <italic class="italic">Salmo salar</italic>) farming in Norway, and different scenarios (model or narrative based) of future development for example for the maritime Arctic (Brigham 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2015</xref>) and fisheries (Eide 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>). The project identified and quantified environmental impacts of emissions from different sources and activities in particular regarding oil spills and response capacity (Nordam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wilkinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2017</xref>); air pollution from ships (Law et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2017</xref>; Schröder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2017</xref>); and noise. Several syntheses were produced for example on food chain interactions in the marine Arctic (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>), seafood production (Troell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2017</xref>) and existing governance regimes and gaps (NERC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, the project contributed tools for research and management support like a data management system (Godøy and Saadatnejad 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2017</xref>), an advanced Arctic Ocean observing system (IAOOS) (Gascard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200" class="xref">2012</xref>), a pan-Arctic marine spatial planning tool (Edwards and Evans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>), a framework for integrated ecosystem-based management (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>) and a set of Arctic indicators for sustainable development (NERC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>). The project also organized two workshops dedicated to indigenous peoples and two transdisciplinary PhD courses, published newsletters, and policy briefs.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3" class="xref">3</xref> In the following, we will illustrate the role of most of these contributions in a broader context, as answers to eight questions related to Arctic development under climate change.
