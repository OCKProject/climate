<p id="Par37" class="p">ACCESS research specifies and quantifies the substantial cost of bringing Arctic resources to markets (Petrick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2017</xref>). The need for special, winterized equipment, including ships and platforms and long distance from support infrastructure make exploration and production activities in the Arctic Ocean especially costly compared to other, even non-conventional sources of hydrocarbons. The challenges posed by temporary sea-ice-coverage, harsh weather conditions, darkness, remoteness of the fields, and lack of infrastructure such as search and rescue (SAR) facilities have up to now hindered exploitation of these resources offshore. ACCESS results show that projects will require a high market price and more cost-effective technology to attract investments. Simultaneously, the pristine Arctic ecosystems are seen as being in danger of pollution by oil and gas production facilities in shore, transportation, and associated infrastructure (Dals√∏ren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2013</xref>; Petrick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2017</xref>). For example, the Yamal Peninsula gas field is currently a fully active enterprise.
