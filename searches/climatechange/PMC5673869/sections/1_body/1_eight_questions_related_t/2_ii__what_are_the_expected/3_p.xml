<p id="Par28" class="p">Each of these studies addresses some partial aspects of the impacts of climate change. An important contribution of the ACCESS project is to provide a description of the impacts of climate change at system level, based on literature studies and theories (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>), modelling (Eide 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>) and observations (Oziel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR300" class="xref">2017</xref>). The integrated picture presented in Crépin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>) builds on most ACCESS work. It reveals for example that the increased fluctuations in stock biomass and stock age composition are likely to remain limited compared with normal environmental fluctuations in this area and market fluctuations (Eide 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>). Ocean acidification could potentially impact many parts of the ecosystems and the economic activities tied to them (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>). New economic activities developing in the Arctic Ocean are also likely to influence Arctic marine resources, as investigated in ACCESS, through increased pressure on the environment due to increased pollution from oil spills (Nordam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2017</xref>; Wilkinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2017</xref>) and maybe air pollution (Law et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2017</xref>). Market changes could substantially influence the demand for these resources (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>; Petrick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2017</xref>; Troell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2017</xref>) and economic activities could compete in using sensitive ecosystem areas (Edwards and Evans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>).
