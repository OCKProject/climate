<p id="Par27" class="p">Indirect effects of climate change are less studied but changes in trophic levels could influence prey patterns, competition between species, and parasitism. Marine invasive species, like crabs, could expand to sub-Arctic and Arctic waters even under moderate climate change scenarios (De Rivera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2007</xref>), due to warmer waters and increased human activities. In particular, the red king crab (
