<p id="Par70" class="p">To that end ACCESS provided a marine spatial planning tool (Edwards and Evans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>) and a framework for integrated ecosystem-based management (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>) that can be used jointly or separately. In contrast to most existing marine spatial plans that focus on particular Arctic regions, the marine spatial planning tool developed under ACCESS has a pan-Arctic scope. It is also a tool rather than a plan and provides a unique online interface that can be used and built on for all kinds of user-defined purposes (Edwards and Evans 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>). The framework for integrated ecosystem-based management goes beyond traditional ecosystem-based management and also incorporates economic and social dynamics. It provides decision support even in cases of scarce data and helps identify potential tipping points; it can also be easily built on as new tools, models, and scientific findings develop (Crépin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2017</xref>). Its top down approach provides a good complement to the bottom up approach used in a resilience assessment (Arctic Council 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2016</xref>) and can also be combined with it.
