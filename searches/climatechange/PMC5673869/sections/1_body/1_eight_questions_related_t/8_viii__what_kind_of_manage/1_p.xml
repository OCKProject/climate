<p id="Par68" class="p">Governance must find ways to grasp the most important impacts of a particular change, also in the geographical context where they occur. Marine spatial planning is a promising tool for this purpose and Norway has put substantial efforts to develop ecosystem-based management and marine spatial planning in the Arctic and in particular the Barents Sea (e.g., Olsen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2013</xref>). Other Arctic governments have been slower to advance marine spatial planning and pan-Arctic initiatives are limited (Ehler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2014</xref>). Governance mechanisms and policy instruments must also be adaptive to respond in a proper way and within appropriate time scales. In addition, the large uncertainties associated with the non-negligible risks of tipping points motivate precautionary approaches including sometimes even safe standards (Margolis and Nævdal
