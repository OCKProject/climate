 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>), ocean observations (Oziel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2016</xref>) and by using numerical models to evaluate the possible development of sea ice and ocean over the coming three decades (see references in Gascard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2017</xref>). This information was also used to evaluate possible developments in economic sectors in the Arctic in the future (see Cr√©pin et al.
