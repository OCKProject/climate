<p id="Par18" class="p">Satellite-based observations have documented a drastic reduction of the Arctic sea-ice area and extent over the past 30 years in all seasons, with a higher rate of decrease in the first decade of this century (Stroeve et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). In addition, mean sea-ice thickness declined from more than 3 m down to less than 2 m (Renner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2014</xref>; Lindsay and Schweiger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2015</xref>), leading to a stark reduction in multiyear ice (Comiso 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2012</xref>). Other Arctic sea-ice characteristics have also started to change and will likely continue to do so, like the length of the sea-ice-free season, earlier break up and later freeze up, the occurrence of melt ponds and the under ice topography (e.g., Hwang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201" class="xref">2015</xref>; Divine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203" class="xref">2016</xref>). All of these changes must be documented and understood, as they all play a role in the Arctic climate system, but they also have a direct impact on the human use of the Arctic.
