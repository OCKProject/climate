<p class="p">Previous studies showed that drier places tend to have lower ANPP because of sparser community, higher evaporation potential, and higher tolerance to drought stress

In addition to the influence of site altitudes, the shifts of ANPP and PUE patterns, from unimodal to approximately linear, may also be attributed to changes in species assembly and trait divergence. Community assembly of plant functional groups have been confirmed by bivariate regressions to be as important as precipitation in controlling and explaining the spatial variation in ANPP
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. In this study, we also found high correlations of ANPP (PUE) with PSD and FTD indices (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). In addition, comparisons of FTD among alpine grassland types showed that plant functional traits were more convergent with lower averages and smaller variations in humid meadows than semi-arid steppes and arid desert-steppes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). This may also contribute to the unimodal patterns of ANPP and PUE at the end of HMI.
