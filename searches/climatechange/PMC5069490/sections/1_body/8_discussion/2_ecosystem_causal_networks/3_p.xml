<p class="p">In this study, we explored the patterns of alpine grassland productivity (ANPP) and its sensitivity (PUE) in response to regional climate changes, and examined both strength and direction of biotic and abiotic drivers within the effect-response framework. First, the nonlinearity of ANPP and PUE in response to abiotic variables was detected by general additive models, in which HMI and altitude entered and together accounted for 80.3% and 68.8% of the variation in ANPP and PUE respectively. This result highlights the combinational influences of climate warming and precipitaoitin fluctuation on alpine grassland dynamics. Because the combination of temperature and precipitation always varies along increasing altitudinal gradients, the elevation-dependency should also pay more attention in modelling alpine grassland responses to climate change in this plateau and other mountainous regions. Second, both principal component analyses and structural equation model confirmed that functional trait diversity, including community weighted means and functional trait divergence, is as important as plant species diversity for explaining the nonlinear relationship between climate changes and ecosystem productivity in alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. These findings are likely due to the collinearitiy of abiotic explanatory factors with climate gradients. On the other hand, due to the environmental filtering effects, plants have been adapted to alpine habitat conditions with highly differential functional traits. Trait flexibility within and across species and changes in plant relative dominance should be examined for long-term studies on the biodiversity-ecosystem functionality relationship.</p>
