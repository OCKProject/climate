<p class="p">Alpine grasslands are generally believed to be sensitive to climate change. Unfortunately, the question how community structure under ongoing climate change affects ecosystem functionality is still poorly understood. To mechanistically understand this question, we have examined the spatial patterns of productivity-biodiversity relationship within an effect-response framework across three zonal alpine grasslands types on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Our results have shown that, at the regional scale, both ANPP and PUE (termed as the ratio of ANPP to GSP) nonlinearly respond to the increasing water availability (HMI) gradient at the regional scale (
