 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Therefore, the unimodal patterns of ANPP and PUE at the dry end of HMI gradient in this study might be modified by site altitude differences, because we have examined unimodal patterns of ANPP and PUE against site altitude at the regional scale. Therefore, our results indicate that elevation dependency of climate changes, especially in the combination of temperature and precipitation, should be also clarified for predicting vegetation dynamic in montane regions
