<p class="p">The responses of alpine grassland communities subject to abiotic and biotic factors have been explored by a few studies based on bi-variate analyses

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. But the collinearity between explanatory variables and the nonlinear response patterns have rarely documented. For example, Yang,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref> reported a unimodal pattern of PUE along mean annual precipitation (MAP) across alpine steppe and meadow communities on the Tibetan Plateau, and attributed it to the linear bivariate relationships of PUE with species richness, soil organic carbon and soil silt content. As soil nutrients were highly correlated with HMI (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>), in this study soil explanatory variables were excluded from the optimal GAMs. Soil C: N was also confirmed to have no significant impacts on either ANPP or PUE in the full SEMs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S4</xref>). This may be attributed to the historical co-evolution of climate, vegetation and soils, because soil development in alpine biomes and mountain regions is mainly controlled by climatic condition there
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>. Therefore, our findings on the collinearity between soil nutrients and climatic factors implied that the dynamics of community structure and ecosystem functionality might be weakly influenced by soil nutrients. This can also explain why no relation exists between corresponding residuals of species richness and productivity after removing environmental influences
