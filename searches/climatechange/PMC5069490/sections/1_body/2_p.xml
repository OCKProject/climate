<p class="p">A positive linear relationship between species richness and productivity has been reported for Tibetan alpine grasslands

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. However, no relation was found between the corresponding residuals of species richness and productivity after environmental and climatic influences were removed. Ma,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> argued that plant species richness can weakly affect community productivity across Tibetan alpine grasslands. In fact, intrinsic community properties, for instance, community assembly of plant functional groups, can be as important as extrinsic abiotic divers in explaining spatial and temporal variabilities of grassland productivity across the Tibetan Plateau
