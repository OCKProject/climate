<p class="p">We sampled 75 plots at 15 sites in total during the peak-growing season of 2014, with five sites for each grassland type, westwardly across humid alpine meadow (AM) dominated by

 <italic class="italic">Stipa purpurea</italic>, and arid alpine desert-steppe (ADS) co-dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">S. purpurea</italic> and
