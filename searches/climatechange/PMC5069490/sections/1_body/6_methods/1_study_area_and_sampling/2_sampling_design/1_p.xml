<p class="p">At each site, we established a sub-enclosure of 200 m × 200 m in size for measuring species composition, leaf traits and aboveground biomass. Five 50 cm × 50 cm plots were independently arranged at 20-m intervals along a random transect line. We identified plant species occurring, measured general leaf height (GLH, cm), and estimated percentage cover for each species within each plot. Aboveground biomass was harvested, sorted by species and stored in paper bags. Plant samples were dried at 65 °C for 48 h and weighted to 0.001 g so that rare species could also be identified. Species frequency was additionally sampled using thirty 0.1 m
