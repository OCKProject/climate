<p class="p">We also followed the distance-based framework of Laliberte and Legendre
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref> to quantify the variance of community trait distribution. Functional trait divergence (FTD) that reflects niche complementarity (overlaps/divergence) was calculated for plant GLH, SLA and LMF, respectively.
