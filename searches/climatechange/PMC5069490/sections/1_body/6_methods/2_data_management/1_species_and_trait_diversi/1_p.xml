<p class="p">We firstly calculated species relative dominance based on percentage cover, leaf height and frequency measured at each site as did Wu, 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Then we defined species richness (
 <italic class="italic">SR</italic>) as the total number of species at each quadrat (Plot_SR). Next, we calculated Shannon index of diversity (Shannon), Simpson index of diversity (Simpson), and Pielou evenness index (Pielou)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>. Plot-SR, Shannon, Simpson and Pielou were grouped as plant species diversity (PSD) indices.
