<p class="p">We downloaded daily records of precipitation and temperature from the China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System (

As low-temperature stress is common over the Tibetan Plateau, plants generally start to grow when it is warm. In addition to GSP, accumulated temperature when daily mean is over 5 °C (AccT) also accumulated
