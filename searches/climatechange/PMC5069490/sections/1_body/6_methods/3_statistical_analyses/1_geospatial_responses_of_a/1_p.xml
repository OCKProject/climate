 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>, generalized additive models (GAM) were induced to cope with problems such as collinearity and non-linearity between responsible and explanatory variables

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>. Here, abiotic explanatory variables include site geographical locations (longitude, latitude, and altitude), climatic factors (GSP, AccT and HMI) and soil properties (SOC, STN and C: N ratio). The response variables were ANPP and PUE at the plot level. We followed a backward selection approach with Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) to find the optimal models out
