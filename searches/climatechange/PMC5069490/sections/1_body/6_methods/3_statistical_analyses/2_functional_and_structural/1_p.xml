 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S3</xref>). Next, we conducted principal component analyses (PCA) to examine functional and structural differences of communities surveyed, firstly did separately for PSD, CWM and FTD, and then pooled them together. We used the PCA coordinates with an eigenvalue &gt;1 to identify the plant strategy along which trait or species diversity indices co-vary across communities.
