<p class="p">The biodiversity indices that were separately grouped into PSD, CWM and FTD, showed different explanatory powers for variance of community structure in this study. The PCA results indicated that the explanatory power of PSD is comparable to the FTD group, the former accounting for 89.68% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4a</xref>) vs. the latter for 94.60% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4c</xref>) of the total variance explained by the first component. The CWM group can account for 78.66% of the total variance, with the first component (43.04%) highly correlated with LMF and the second component (35.62%) highly correlated with GLH and SLA (
