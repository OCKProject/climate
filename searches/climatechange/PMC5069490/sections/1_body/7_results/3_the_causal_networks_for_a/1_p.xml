<p class="p">The influence of HMI on ANPP was mainly mediated through PSD and CWM of plant functional traits. HMI directly (

 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.24, standardized coefficient) and PSD (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.24, standardized coefficient), impacted ANPP (

 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.52, standardized coefficient) while FTD was mainly determined by PSD (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.69, standardized coefficient). The influence of HMI on PUE was significantly mediated by PSD (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.32, standardized coefficient) and CWM (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.23, standardized coefficient) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5b</xref>). The indirect influence of HMI through PSD on PUE was approximately equal in magnitude to the direct influence of HMI (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = 0.34, standardized coefficient). The FTD of plant traits and soil properties (SCNR) were no significant impacts on PUE (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S4</xref>). The strongest relationship observed in the SEM analyses was between PSD and FTD (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.69, standardized coefficient).
