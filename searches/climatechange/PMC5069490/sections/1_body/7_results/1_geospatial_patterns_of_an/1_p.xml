<p class="p">Due to collinearity between explanatory variables (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Tables S2 and S3</xref>). The smoothers of HMI and site altitude were significant, entered the optimal models, and together explained 80.3% of the variation in ANPP and 68.8% of variation in PUE (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), respectively. The patterns of ANPP and PUE are similar, showing clear increasing trends along the HMI gradient from approximately 0.18 mm °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to the most humid sites 0.4 mm °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, and unimodal patterns at the dry end of the HMI gradient, lower than 0.18 mm °C
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
