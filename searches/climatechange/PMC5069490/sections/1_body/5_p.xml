<p class="p">In this paper, we concretely aim (1) to examine differences in biodiversity and functionality among zonal alpine grassland types, especially focusing on for functional trait diversity indices; (2) to clarify the spatial patterns of biodiversity and functionality along geographical, edaphic and climatic gradients at a regional scale; (3) to figure out direct and indirect links between biodiversity and functionality in response to the regional water availability gradient, an indicator of habitat moisture. In addition, we also want to find out whether plant functional trait diversity indices are more effective than the traditional plant species diversity (PSD) indices, such as richness, dominance and evenness, in explaining the sensitivity of alpine grassland productivity to regional climatic gradients across the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
