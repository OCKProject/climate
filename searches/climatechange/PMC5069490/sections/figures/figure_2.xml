  <title class="title">Hypothetical interrelations among climate, soil, community structure, and ecosystem function (sensitivity) of alpine grasslands on the Northern Tibetan Plateau.</title>
  <p class="p">Red lines are for direct impacts, blue lines for indirect impacts, and green lines for covariations. Habitat moisture index (HMI) equals the ratio of growing season precipitation (GSP) to accumulated temperature when daily mean is over 5 °C (AccT). Soil C: N ratio (SCNR) was also considered in this study. Plant species diversity (PSD) includes the indices of richness, Shannon, Simpson, Pielou evenness at the plot level. Community weighted means (CWM) and functional trait divergence (FTD) were calculated from general leaf height (GLH, cm), specific leaf area (SLA, cm
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> g
   <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and leaf mass fraction (LMF, %).
