  <p class="p">Structural equation models examining effects of environmental factors and biodiversity components on ANPP (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and PUE (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), respectively, at the regional scale across zonal alpine grassland types on the Northern Tibetan Plateau. Green and red arrows indicate significant positive and negative effects, respectively. Line width illustrates path strength. Values associated with path arrows represent standardized path coefficients. Values near to the round arrows show the residuals. Non-significant paths and variables were eliminated from the final SEMs. Results of model fitting: (
