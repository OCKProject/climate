   <bold class="bold">b</bold>)-based on community weight means (CWM) of general leaf height (CWM_GLH), leaf mass fraction (CWM_LMF) and specific leaf area (CWM_SLA); (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>)-based on functional trait divergence (FTD) of general leaf height (FTD_GLH), leaf mass fraction (FTD_LMF) and specific leaf area (FTD_SLA); and (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>)-with all potential explanatory variables being pooled together. Yellow diamonds, blue triangles and green squares represent alpine meadow (AM), steppe (AS) and desert-steppe (ADS), respectively. For each component we indicate the percentage of variance explained.
