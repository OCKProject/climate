<p class="p">A model summarizing selected Gene Ontologies (GO) and pathways in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> over the course of the experiment shows the up/down regulated cellular processes and implies different cellular responses to stress (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). GOs enriched early in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic>, including protein ubiquitination and apoptosis, appear only later in the experiment in 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic>. GOs that are related to cell morphological changes could be a manifestation of this heat stress in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic>. In contrast, ribosome biogenesis, generation of precursor metabolism and energy, and intracellular transport processes, appear earlier in 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> than 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic>, while the process of carbohydrate catabolism is absent from 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata.</italic> We postulate that the enrichment of metabolic processes (generation of precursor metabolism and energy and cellular carbonhydrate catabolic process) might enable 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> to postpone temperature-induced protein degradation and cell death.
