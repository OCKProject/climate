Experimental duration was eight and five months according to the natural SST inclination for the Mediterranean and Red Sea corals, respectively. Coral samples were collected at intervals for RNA extraction and the maximum quantum yield (Fv/Fm) of algal symbionts was calculated as a measure of photosynthetic performance, which is considered as an indicator of thermal stress
