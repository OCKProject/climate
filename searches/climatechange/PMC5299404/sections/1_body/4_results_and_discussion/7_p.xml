 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref> including the pair of cysteine residues (positions 30 and 105) that probably form a disulfide bridge
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. Moreover, some residues were specific for corals (for example A in position 7, G-81, N-98). At the present stage we can only speculate whether proteins possessing this domain could play a major role as unique chaperones or fulfill some other yet unknown novel function in the coral response to environmental stress.
