 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> sequenced reads were assembled into transcriptomes of 159,679 and 313,813 open-reading-frame-contigs, respectively and fold changes were calculated for all contigs. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were arbitrarily defined as those exceeding a two-fold-change (p-value &lt; 0.05). The first increase in DEGs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1H</xref>) was seen in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> at 6 °C above control (sty6), but only after 9 °C (bala9) in 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic>. However, in both corals DEG numbers increased with temperature and even more with combined temperature-pH, although the ratio of up- vs. down-regulated genes, showed species differences (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> the percentage of up- and down-regulated genes were similar throughout most of the experiment, but in 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> the percent of down-regulated genes increased from 3% of total DEGs at the beginning, to 43% by the end of the experiment. With combined temperature-pH treatment, most (71%) of the DEGs were down-regulated in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> but not in 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic>. The clustering in control samples can be seen in three-dimensional space principle components (PC) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>) and hierarchical clustering heat maps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). An elevation of only 2 °C was sufficient to change the pattern of gene expression in 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> but at least an increase of 9 °C was needed to separate 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> from the control.
