<p class="p">This study demonstrates that temperate corals used to higher annual temperature fluctuations than those faced by tropical species, have developed thermotolerance and resistance to pH change. It has been previously shown that daily environmental fluctuations in a physically challenging microhabitat promote thermotolerance in corals
