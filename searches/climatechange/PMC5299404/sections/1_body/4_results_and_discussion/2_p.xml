<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea,</italic> Fv/Fm (algal maximum quantum yield) values were higher than those for 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic>, most notably at the combined treatment of 7.8 pH and 6 °C elevation in comparison to the control (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1G</xref>). This reflects the lower annual change in SST of the sub-tropical habitat (

 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> as sensitive to heat stress and lower pH in comparison to 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1F</xref>). Significant change was observed between the temperature and the integrated temperature-pH treatments in some measuring points, implying on a synergistic effect between pH and temperature.
