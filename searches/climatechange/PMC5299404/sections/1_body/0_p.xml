<p class="p">Corals worldwide have been affected by global warming and the accompanying ocean acidification, experiencing reduced skeleton calcification and severe bleaching events that often lead to coral death

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Mediterranean corals thrive despite a wide annual fluctuation of sea surface temperatures (SSTs), ranging ~13 °C in the Ligurian Sea, compared to sub-tropical corals, facing only a ~6 °C fluctuation in the Red Sea

This demonstrates the adaptability of some scleractinian corals and suggests that understanding the compensatory cellular mechanism of temperate corals is crucial to forecast the overall fate of corals in an era of global warming and ocean acidification.
