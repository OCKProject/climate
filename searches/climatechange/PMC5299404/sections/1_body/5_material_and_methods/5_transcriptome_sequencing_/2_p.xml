<p class="p">The final libraries were quantified by using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and quality tested by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer High Sensitivity or DNA 1000 assay (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were then processed with Illumina cBot for cluster generation on the flowcell and sequenced in paired-end mode on HiSeq2500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA), following the manufacturersâ€™ instructions for a rapid run. The CASAVA 1.8.2 version of the Illumina pipeline was used to process raw data for both format conversion and de-multiplexing. The Fastq files have been deposited at SRA database under the accessions: SRP075606 (
