<p class="p">Samples of total RNA from 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> were pooled (into 1 μg each sample) and sent to the IGA Technology Services facility in Udine, Italy for pair-end Hiseq barcoding. Upon arrival at the IGA total RNA of the samples was re-analyzed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer system (Agilent, Waltham, MA) to ensure that no damage had occurred during shipment. Libraries were prepared using the ‘TruSeq mRNA Sample Prep kit’ (Illumina, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Poly-A mRNA was fragmented (3 min at 94 °C) and every purification step was performed using 1X Agencourt AMPure XP beads.
