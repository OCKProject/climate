<p class="p">Annotations were created by blasting the proteome against the 
 <italic class="italic">Homo sapiens</italic> database using BLASTP (NCBI). Annotations were also created from the Swissprot and Uniprot50 databases by BLASTP. We applied filtering to the BLASTP results in order to increase the certainty of obtaining true homologs. With regards to the 
 <italic class="italic">H. sapiens</italic> annotations, our filtering parameters were set at an e-value threshold of 5 * 10
 <sup class="sup">−5</sup>, &gt;30% alignment identity and &gt;70% query coverage. After annotation filtration, 22,881 annotated contigs remained for 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> and 61,908 contigs for 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic>.
