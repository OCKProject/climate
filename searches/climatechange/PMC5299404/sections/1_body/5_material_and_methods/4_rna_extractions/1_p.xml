 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> polyps using Total RNA kit (A&amp;A Biotechnology), according to manufacturer’s instructions, with the minor modifications that all the centrifugations were cooled and the RNA was extracted using double the recommended amount of Fenzol (in order to cover the entire fragment), and was vortexed during the 5 minute incubation. Following the incubation, the tube was centrifuged 12,000 g, 20 min, in order to reduce algae cell contamination and remove the remains of the unwanted pellet. The final elution volume was 50 μl.
