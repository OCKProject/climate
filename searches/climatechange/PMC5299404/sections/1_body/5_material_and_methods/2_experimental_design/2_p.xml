<p class="p">For the Mediterranean coral experiments, 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> polyps were placed in each of three aquaria: (1) Control aquarium - constant 17 °C (mimicking the average annual ambient temperatures conditions) and ambient pH. (2) Temperature treatment–Increase in temperature from 17 °C to 29 °C at a rate of 1 °C increase every three weeks under ambient pH. (3) Temperature and pH treatment −1 °C increase every three weeks from 17 °C to 29 °C while maintaining a pH of 7.8. Five polyps from every aquarium were sampled, at the beginning of the experiment at 17 °C and then a week after the temperatures reached: 20 °C, 23 °C, 26 °C and 29 °C. The sampled fragments and polyps were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at −80 °C for RNA extraction.
