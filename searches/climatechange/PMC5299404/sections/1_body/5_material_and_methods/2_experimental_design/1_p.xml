<p class="p">For the Red Sea coral experiments, six 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> colonies were placed in each 300 L aquarium: (1) Control aquarium–constant 24 °C (mimicking the average annual ambient temperatures conditions) and ambient pH. (2) Temperature treatment–Increase in temperature from 24 °C to 31 °C at a rate of 1 °C every three weeks (mimicking the annual rate in Eilat) under ambient pH. (3) Temperature and pH treatment −1 °C increase every three weeks from 24 °C to 31 °C while maintaining a pH of 7.8. Two fragments approximately 2 cm long were chopped and sampled from the upper branches of every colony and aquarium, at the beginning of the experiment and a week after the temperatures reached: 26 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 31 °C.
