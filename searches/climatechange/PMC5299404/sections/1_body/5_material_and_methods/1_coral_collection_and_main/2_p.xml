<p class="p">All the corals were acclimated and maintained in 600 L aquariums with circulating artificial seawater (Brightwell Aquatics) under controlled constant conditions of temperature and 35‰ salinity, mimicking the average annual ambient temperatures conditions. The annual cycle of diurnal-dimming light regime was simulated with an Advanced Control Lighting System (ACLS, Sfiligoi, Italy) and HQI (Hydrargyrum quartz iodide) light bulbs (400 W, 14000 Kelvin). The corals were fed once a day with a microvore microdiet (Brightwell Aquatics). Following the acclimation period, the corals were transferred into 300 L aquariums, with the running flow controlled by a computer system, through closed circulation to compensate for salinity fluctuations and water level changes (constant salinity level of 35‰).</p>
