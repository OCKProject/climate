<p class="p">To validate the RNA-seq results, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-qPCR) assays were performed for four highly expressed selected genes and a comparison made between the results in the treated and control samples. For 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic>, small heat shock protein and calmodulin genes, which were up- and down-regulated respectively, after 30 °C treatment, were selected. For 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic>, we selected ferritin and nitric oxide synthase, which were up-regulated after 29 °C treatment.
