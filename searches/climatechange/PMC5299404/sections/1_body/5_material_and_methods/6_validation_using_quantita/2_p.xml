<p class="p">Complementary DNAs were synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with 1 μl Solaris RNA spike (Thermo-Scientific) using the qScript cDNA synthesis Kit (Quanta Biosciences), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Specific qRT-PCR primers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S6</xref>) were designed to amplify 100–200 bp PCR products. Assuming equal RNA loading, the Solaris spike controls are designed to act as a synthetic exogenous control to identify the presence of reaction inhibition thereby circumventing the need for a housekeeping gene

Spike-inoculated cDNA aliquots were diluted 1:10 and a 4 μl sample was used in technical triplicates for 10 μL qRT-PCR reactions including 0.5 μl mix of forward and reverse primers, 5 μl of GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (Promega), and 0.5 μl of RNAse free water, for 45 cycles. A melt curve analysis obtained by incubating the reactions for 10 s at 0.5 °C increments between 60 °C and 90 °C was generated for each pair of primers, to test for nonspecific amplification products. The comparative ΔΔCTs method was used, and fold changes were calculated using the 2
