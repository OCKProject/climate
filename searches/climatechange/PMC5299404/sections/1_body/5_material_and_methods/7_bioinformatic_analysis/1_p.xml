<p class="p">We utilized Partek Genomic suite software (version 6.6, Copyright©2012, Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO, USA) to plot a three-dimensional space principle component analysis and to generate Venn diagrams and hierarchical clustering heat maps for 
 <italic class="italic">S. pistillata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. europaea</italic> samples (Heat maps were generated using Euclidean distance as a similarity measure and average linkage).The fold changes were calculated for all contigs using the average of the relevant controls (each coral species by its control samples). An arbitrary cutoff of at least two fold (p-value &lt; 0.05) was chosen to define a differentially expressed gene (DEG).
