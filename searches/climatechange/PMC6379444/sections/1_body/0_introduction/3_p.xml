<p id="Par4" class="p">Despite these issues, the question of the attribution of biodiversity responses to climate change is one of the key unanswered questions in ecology

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>, we are still not able to attribute individualistic species responses (both terrestrial and aquatic species) to climate variability, particularly at regional or local scales

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>. Addressing this ‘trend attribution’ question in ecological research is of crucial importance. What we mean by ‘trend attribution’ here is not aiming to attribute biological changes to greenhouse gasses or natural climate variability but to better understand biotic responses to recent climate change regardless what the cause at the local or regional scale might be. Achieving this would allow a more complete understanding of species sensitivity to climate change and provides the basis for the conservation of regionally and locally important species, such as key species or those crucial for ecosystem functioning and services

 </sup>. It would also help to better understand the ecology and patterns of species invasions on local and regional scales and to identify if alien species have profited from recent climate change
