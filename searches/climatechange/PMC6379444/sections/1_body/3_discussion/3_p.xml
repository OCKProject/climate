<p id="Par17" class="p">Winter and autumn precipitation trends were strongly dependent on the duration of the analysed time series and are more predominant and spatially heterogeneous for the 1901–2015 period than for 1901–1950. Although changes in precipitation are highly spatially and temporarily variable, and trends are less spatially homogenous, we found an increasing trend of Summer precipitation for northern Germany, which has been previously mainly detected for southern Europe

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>,
