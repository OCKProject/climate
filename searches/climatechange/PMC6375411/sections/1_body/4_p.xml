<p class="p">Guo and colleagues projected that by the 2090s, average ambient temperatures in China would rise by 1.6°C and by 3.8°C under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively. To estimate the effects of climate change on HFMD, they held constant the childhood population size and the association between temperature and disease incidence. Based on statistical regression methods, they subsequently projected that toward the end of the century, countrywide HFMD incidence rates could increase by 3.2% to 5.3%, depending on the emission pathway.</p>
