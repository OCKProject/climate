<p class="p">For the current study, researchers modeled future HFMD caseloads based on what is already known about the association between HFMD and temperature in China. Led by Yuming Guo, an associate professor of environmental epidemiology and biostatistics at Australia’s Monash University, the researchers first collected temperature and childhood HFMD incidence data reported from 362 different sites throughout the country between 2009 and 2014. Those data were used to model future disease incidence rates under two “pathways” (possible futures) of greenhouse gas emissions over this century.
 <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref> The first pathway, known as Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5), assumes that greenhouse gas emissions will stabilize after 2100. The second, RCP8.5, assumes emissions will continue to rise.
