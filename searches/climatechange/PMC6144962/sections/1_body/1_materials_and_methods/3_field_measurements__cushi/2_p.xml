<p class="p">At each plot, we measured the size (i.e., cushion area, following the methods of Doak &amp; Morris, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) of all 30 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals regardless of cushion size for data to test Hypothesis 1a. To estimate population density within each plot in order test Hypothesis 1b, we delineated an area of 0.5 m (to achieve a standard width within trail‐side and off‐trail plots) by the maximum length of the plot and recorded which 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals we found within it. We picked this area to be the 0.5 m width within the plot that had the highest density of plants, and fit this area to trail curvature for trail‐side plots (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Of the 30 individuals measured per plot, we randomly picked five individuals (henceforth, “focal plants”) for additional measurements of either flower or fruit number (depending on individual plant phenology at the time of censoring) and sex (hermaphrodite or female) in order to test Hypothesis 2.
