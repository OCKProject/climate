<p class="p">To test if facilitation by disturbed cushion plants is stronger and more important in maintaining species diversity at higher sites (Hypothesis 3), we examined the effects of disturbance, elevation, and 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> presence on community characteristics with a set of LMMs separately for species richness, Shannon diversity, and percent vegetation cover (Supporting Information Table A2 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). These models include different combinations of elevation, disturbance, 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> presence, and sample size area, with sample size never tested without added effect of cushion presence (Supporting Information Table B2 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). To improve model stability, we centered and scaled sampling area. Model details are as described above, with a nested random effect of site and cushion‚Äêcontrol pair. To examine how community competitiveness is influenced by disturbance, elevation, and cushion presence, we fit LMMs with these all combinations of these three parameters separately on inside and neighboring average community competitive index (Supporting Information Table B3 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Model details are as described above, with a nested random effect of site.
