<p class="p">We quantified communities in several ways. First, we used direct data on the non‐
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> plants in each cushion or control area to determine absolute species richness, Shannon diversity (“vegan” package; Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), percent cover of non‐
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> plants, and community competitiveness. We derived species competitive values from species indicator values assigned to each species in Switzerland (Landolt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Each species has a value indicating its position on Grime's Triangle, such that most competitive species are coded as “ccc,” most ruderal as “rrr,” and most stress‐tolerant as “sss,” with any combination of three letters possible. We assigned each species a competitive value from 0 to 3 according to how many “c”s its three‐letter code contained. For each sampling unit (i.e., individual cushion, control, or their respective neighboring rings), we calculated the species average competitive value.
