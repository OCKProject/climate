<p class="p">In order to understand how soil parameters influence species richness, diversity, and percent cover, we removed cushion presence and included SOM and SWC in our inside species LMMs (Supporting Information Tables A2 and B2 in Appendices S1 and S2, respectively). To improve model stability, we centered and scaled SOM and SWC. We did not include these soil parameters in our first model set, as this dataset has a smaller sample size. To then understand how cushion presence, disturbance, and elevation influence SOM and SWC, we tested these effects with LMMs (Supporting Information Tables A3 and B4 in Appendices S1 and S2, respectively). Since soil samples were taken underneath cushions and their respective controls, and not separately for neighboring environments, we could only test for effects on inside species. Model details are as described above, with a nested random effect of site and cushion‚Äêcontrol pair.</p>
