<p class="p">Following many alpine facilitation studies and as part of our test of Hypothesis 3, we tested for effects on RII and Brayâ€“Curtis dissimilarity values with LMMs. These models include disturbance and elevation as fixed effects, and site as a random effect (Supporting Information Tables A4 and B5 in Appendices S1 and S2, respectively). All models were structured as described in the previous section, and we tested the effects on inside and neighboring species separately.</p>
