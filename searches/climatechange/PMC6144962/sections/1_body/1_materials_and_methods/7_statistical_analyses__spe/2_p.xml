<p class="p">In order to account for the species differences observed between each focal plant and its associated control area, we calculated two separate indices. The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity index is a measure of compositional dissimilarity between two sites (Bray &amp; Curtis, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0502" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1957</xref>), which we calculated using the “vegan” package (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). We calculated separate dissimilarities between a focal plant and its control (i.e., inside species), and between the 5 cm neighboring ring around a focal plant and the replicated ring around its control (i.e., neighboring species). The relative interaction index (RII; Armas, Ordiales, &amp; Pugnaire, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) is a measure of interaction intensity between plants, with positive values indicating facilitation and negative values competition. We calculated a RII between the cushion vs. control inside species and the cushion vs. control neighboring species as follows: RII = (

 <sub class="sub">cushion</sub>–
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">control</sub>)/(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cushion</sub> + 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">control</sub>), where N is species richness (RII
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>), species diversity (RII
 <sub class="sub">shan</sub>), or total percent cover (RII
 <sub class="sub">cov</sub>).
