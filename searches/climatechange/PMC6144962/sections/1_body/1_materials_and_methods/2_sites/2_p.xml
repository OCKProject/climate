<p class="p">We established three sampling sites located along popular alpine hiking trails on two summits and one mountain pass (Piz Beverin, Haldensteiner Calanda, Fallerfurgga) within the canton of Grisons in southeastern Switzerland. We chose the summits using known occurrence locations (InfoFlora 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) to ensure that sampling sites span 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>'s elevational range. At four evenly spaced elevations (i.e., elevational levels) encompassing 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>'s local (i.e., within site) elevational range, we sampled disturbed (trail‐side) and paired undisturbed (off‐trail) plots with a standard width (1 m for trail‐side plots and 5 m for off‐trail plots) and variable length (mean size = 16 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) between June and August 2016. We defined plots as the area including the first 30 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals we encountered at each elevational level. For trail‐side plots, we marked the first 30 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals within 0.5 m on either side of the trail while walking uphill. For off‐trail plots, we walked at least 10 m away from the trail to find an undisturbed (i.e., no hiker or livestock trail) area of similar topography as the trail, and marked the first 30 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals while walking uphill, back and forth in a 5 m width (Figure
