<p class="p">Plots span an elevational range of 1,950–2,680 m, are characterized by a continental alpine climate, and have a bedrock type predominantly classified as biogenic sedimentary rock (Federal Office of Topography, 2016). The summer growing season (June, July, August) has a mean monthly temperature of 5°C and mean monthly precipitation of 180 mm, and annual precipitation is 1,411 mm (1981‐2010 at Weissfluhjoch Weather Station; Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology MeteoSwiss

These sites have been moderately grazed by livestock (mainly cattle and sheep) for centuries, and the trails we sampled have been used as mountain passages for over a century. These sites are currently still used by livestock, with higher use at lower elevations, and livestock use is similar between sites. As evidenced by low dung counts at all sites (
