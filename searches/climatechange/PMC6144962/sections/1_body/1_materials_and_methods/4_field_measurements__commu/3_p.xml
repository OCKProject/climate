<p class="p">To characterize soils from cushions and controls, we extracted soil samples at 4 cm depth using a spoon of approximately 20 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> at three cushion/control pairs per plot. We placed each soil sample in a plastic bag in the field. We determined soil water content (% SWC) by weighing the soil samples before and after drying them &gt;48 hr at 60°C. We determined soil organic matter content (% SOM) of sieved soil samples (at 2 mm mesh size) by the loss on ignition method: 2 subsamples of 2 g dry soil per sample burned at 410°C for 40 hr (following the methods of Schöb, Butterfield, &amp; Pugnaire, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and weighed again after cooling. We averaged the values of the two samples for our measure of % SOM. At each plot, we measured microhabitat temperature over 1 year with temperature loggers (Maxim Integrated iButtons, CA, USA) buried at 2 cm depth under one of the focal cushions and its corresponding control.
