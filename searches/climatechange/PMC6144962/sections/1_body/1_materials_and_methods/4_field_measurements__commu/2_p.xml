<p class="p">For each of the five focal plants in each plot, we established a control area of the same size but without any

 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We identified the identity and percent cover of other plant species growing inside each cushion and control area (i.e., inside species), as well as within 5 cm of the cushion edge and control edge (i.e., neighboring species) for data to test Hypothesis 3. Our sampling protocol yielded 5 cushion/control pairs per disturbance type by elevation and 30–40 pairs per site, totaling 100 pairs.
