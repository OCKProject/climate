<p class="p">We calculated two reproduction indices, fruit density and relative reproductive success. Due to differences in sampling times and phenology, some plants were in flower and others in fruit when sampled. We therefore converted flower to fruit number for plants of each sex using relationships from 628 individual 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> plants from Colorado, USA (D. F. Doak, W. F. Morris, and M. L. Peterson, unpublished data; no comparable local data were available). These data show strong and significant correlations between flower number and seed‐bearing fruits within the same growing season (females:
