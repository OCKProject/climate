<p class="p">In each set of LMMs, we fit a series of alternative models for each dependent variable with differing combinations of main effects (Supporting Information Table B1 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), with all models including a random intercept and a random site effect. We included the explanatory variable of elevational level in all model sets, as this metric had much higher overall predictive power than absolute elevation, elevation above lowest local
