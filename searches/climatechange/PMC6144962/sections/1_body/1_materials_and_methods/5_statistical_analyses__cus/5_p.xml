<p class="p">We used fruit density (number of fruits/cushion size) as a broad measure of reproductive output. We also quantified relative reproductive output through several steps to arrive at a size‐ and sex‐independent measure of relative reproduction. We first regressed fruit number on cushion area for each sex, and then as an index of relative reproductive success divided each plant's residual by the predicted value for its sex and size. Values greater than one indicate high reproductive rate while those below one show less than expected production. We also tested whether fruit production correlates with other aspects of individual performance by regressing relative reproductive rate on relative growth rate for the Colorado data set, and found that the two values are weakly correlated (
