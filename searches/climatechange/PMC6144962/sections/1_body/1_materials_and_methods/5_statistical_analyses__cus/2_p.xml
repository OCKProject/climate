<p class="p">To test whether disturbance largely benefits cushion plant growth at low elevations and has a net negative effect at high elevations (Hypothesis 1a), we first examined size distribution differences between disturbed and undisturbed 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals with a Kolmogorov–Smirnov test. Second, to further test Hypothesis 1a and to test whether population density is reduced by disturbance at all elevations (Hypothesis 1b), we quantified the effects of disturbance and elevation on the plot‐level densities and on individual size of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> plants (Supporting Information Table A1a in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) using two separate sets of linear mixed models (LMMs; see below for details). Third, to test if higher abundance of species inside disturbed cushions has a negative effect on reproduction across all elevations (Hypothesis 2), we examined the effects of disturbance, elevation, and several community indices (Supporting Information Table A1b in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) on 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> reproduction indicators (fruit density, relative reproduction) by fitting another set of LMMs. We fit a separate model set using either inside or neighboring community measures, in order to understand effect differences from species growing within cushions (inside species) compared to those growing adjacent (neighboring species). Lastly, we tested the effects of disturbance, level, SOM, and SWC on 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushion size and reproduction indicators, to understand how disturbance‐mediated changes in habitat are important.
