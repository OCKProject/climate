<p class="p">We studied systems adjacent to popular hiking trails where trampling is a frequent and relatively high‐intensity disturbance, similar in its severe erosion effects to high‐intensity grazing and landslides. Our data shows that disturbance spurs growth, but reduces population density and reproduction of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). We suspect that disturbance, either through the mechanical manipulation of cushions or by altering soil conditions, increases adult plant size and reproduction while greatly reducing the ability of smaller plants to survive. This corresponds to the size structure differences we see between disturbed and undisturbed areas, as well as to our findings that population density is lower with disturbance. In the short term, this suggests a positive effect of disturbance on 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> growth, however the long‐term effect could be a decline in 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> populations as reproduction is decreased and young individuals are unable to survive the impacts of disturbance. The balance between these effects with increased performance of large plants will determine the long‐term net population effects of disturbance, which we cannot judge from our short‐term data. One potential scenario is disturbed populations progressing to larger and larger size structures, with an eventual population decline as these older cushions die off without replacement by younger individuals.
