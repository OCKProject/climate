<p class="p">Although other studies have showed that disturbance can negatively affect nurse plant abundance, size, and density (e.g., Ballantyne &amp; Pickering, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>), we are not aware of other studies that have examined responses in cushion plant size structure and reproduction to relatively high disturbance levels. However, past studies also point to changes in abundance and percent cover. Trampling disturbance can reduce the dominant vegetation cover and therefore increase cushion plant cover (Whinam &amp; Chilcott, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), as well as cause graminoid species to replace cushion plants growing at lower elevations. Direct trampling on cushions causes portions of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions to die off (Willard &amp; Marr, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>), which we also observed (
 <italic class="italic">pers. observation</italic>) for cushions growing in the center of the trail. Compared to other alpine tundra species, however, 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions can be relatively resistant to trampling (Willard, Cooper, &amp; Forbes, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
