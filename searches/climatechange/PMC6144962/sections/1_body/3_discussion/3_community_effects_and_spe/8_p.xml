<p class="p">Disturbance likely favors plant morphologies that increase resistance to disturbance (e.g., cushion plants with a taproot) and functional groups that can quickly recover after disturbance (e.g., ruderal species). The Swiss Alps have experienced centuries of intermediate disturbance by livestock grazing, resulting in productive and species‐rich meadows above tree line. In fact, reduction in grazing has reduced species richness at these elevations (Dullinger, Dirnböck, Greimler, &amp; Grabherr, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Within these intermediately disturbed areas, we examined areas specifically characterized by relatively high‐intensity disturbance (i.e., hiker trails). We use the terms “undisturbed” and “disturbed” for ease in differentiation of our sampling areas. However, even our “undisturbed” areas experience intermediate levels of disturbance via grazing, while the disturbed areas experience both intermediate grazing and frequent intensity hiker trampling disturbance. Such higher levels of disturbance very likely push these areas above optimal levels of disturbance and into levels of high abiotic stress. Considering that absolute percent vegetation cover in these disturbed areas was still quite high (mean = 48%) compared to undisturbed areas (mean = 58%), it is clear that although our disturbed sites experience a high frequency of human trampling, they are not disturbed enough that they could support only minimal plant life.
