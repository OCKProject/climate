<p class="p">The cushion plant 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> has been found to host an increasing number of species at higher elevations (Antonsson, Björk, &amp; Molau, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), while also demonstrating greatest facilitative effects on other species at the center of its elevational range (Bonanomi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) as well as in abiotically stressful environments (Kjaer, Olsen, &amp; Klanderud, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). We therefore expected cushion plants to first, host higher species diversity and richness compared to control areas, and second, maintain this higher diversity in areas where disturbance exerts negative effects. Our careful selection of control areas near to 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions that had similar microhabitats is one likely reason that our findings differ from other plant facilitation studies, where control areas are randomly selected near to cushions (e.g., Butterfield et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Since cushion plants, including 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>, as well as other alpine species, tend to disproportionately occur in favorable microhabitats, we believe that our approach in selecting control areas allows better differentiation of the effects of cushions on other species. This is especially true for alpine environments, which are known to be highly variable in topography, with slight variations in slope and aspect playing a large role in determining species community (Körner, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Completely random choice of control sites can therefore include very different and often less favorable microclimates than those occupied by cushion plants, whereas choosing control areas that match microtopography is likely a more accurate representation of what a species community would look like in the absence of cushion plants. Careful attention to the spatial representation of the microhabitat environment is especially important in ecosystems with cushion plants, as the beneficial microhabitat provided by cushion plants may buffer the effects of climate change (Anthelme, Cavieres, &amp; Dangles, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>).
