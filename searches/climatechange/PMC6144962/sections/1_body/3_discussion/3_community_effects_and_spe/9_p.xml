<p class="p">With global climate change, species ranges, and therefore biotic interactions, are shifting along latitudinal and elevational gradients. We show that species communities are susceptible to the effects of relatively high‐intensity trampling disturbance, which has negative effects on cushion plants at the population level. In combination with the projected upward expansion of more competitive lower elevation species, this could ultimately lead to sites with high disturbance intensity experiencing rapidly diminishing cushion plant populations at the lower elevational limit. The negative effects of sustained high‐intensity disturbance at upper elevational range limits could ultimately reduce the persistence of upper elevational populations.</p>
