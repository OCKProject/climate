<p class="p">Other studies have shown that facilitative interactions break down at high levels of abiotic stress (for review see Liancourt, Le Bagousse‐Pinguet, Rixen, &amp; Dolezal,

 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), implying that positive interactions only increase up to a certain threshold. Considering that trails are sources of frequent disturbances, the lack of facilitative effects in these areas is perhaps not surprising. This is especially true at the species’ upper elevational range limit, where there is increased abiotic stress due to the colder climate. However, we expected to find some indication of facilitation in our off‐trail plots, but competitive interactions dominate here as well. While surprising to us, these results are in agreement with multiple studies that have found lower species richness in cushion plants compared to control areas (e.g., de Bello et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), although they contrast with some other alpine facilitation studies (e.g., Butterfield et al.,
