<p class="p">Since richness and diversity inside cushions increase with cushion size, we suspect that the positive effects of cushions are only seen once cushions reach a certain size. Comparison of our data with data gathered for another facilitation study (Butterfield et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) at one of our sites (Val Bercla at Fallerfurgga) shows that our control areas had significantly higher species richness (Supporting Information Figure A8a in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), however our data represents the lower end of cushion size distribution (Supporting Information Figure A8b in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). As found in many other studies, we would expect a positive correlation between nurse plant size and species richness and diversity (e.g., Incerti et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Molenda, Reid, &amp; Lortie, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Tewksbury &amp; Lloyd, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Yang, Chen, Schöb, &amp; Hang, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Smaller nurse plants understandably cannot provide the same microhabitat shelter that larger ones do, and likely act as competitors to other species in the area as they establish. Furthermore, larger plants have had longer time periods in which to accumulate inside species, and their larger surface area increases the chance of establishment by other species. We therefore expected the larger cushions in disturbed environments to have increased richness and diversity, but our results suggest that the overall negative impacts of disturbance on species richness and diversity prevail. In fact, closer examination of richness and diversity as a function of total cushion size shows that disturbed cushions and control areas have a much lower accumulation of species richness and diversity than undisturbed ones (Supporting Information Figure A9 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Although our model results point to a negative influence of cushion presence on species richness and diversity, disturbance appears to be a stronger driver of these species measures. Disturbance has been found to mediate plant traits that influence facilitative interactions in other systems (Catorci, Malatesta, Velasquez, Tardella, &amp; Zeballos, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), however studies examining the impacts of both disturbance and plant traits on facilitative interactions are, to our knowledge, rare. Such relatively high‐intensity disturbances can ultimately prevent plant species from recovering, as shown in a comparable system in the Alaskan arctic tundra (Monz, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>).
