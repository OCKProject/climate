<p class="p">Our absolute community measures show a negative response to disturbance, but we surprisingly did not detect any significant changes in RII between disturbance types nor along our sampled elevation gradient. Many facilitation studies argue for the use of RII to detect differences in species interactions (e.g., Butterfield et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Schöb et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), however this method does not allow small differences between cushions and control areas to be picked up. Many published facilitation studies observed a much larger difference between cushions and control areas than we did, and therefore the use of RII is reasonable. Using RII to determine if a system is characterized by competitive or facilitative interactions assumes that the relationship between cushion and neighboring communities is proportional, but this relationship undoubtedly changes across climatic regions and ecosystems. The analysis of absolute community measures could therefore present a clearer picture, especially with small differences between cushions and control areas.
