<p class="p">Species composition changes have been observed in other disturbed systems (e.g., Monz, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Suding &amp; Goldberg, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), and a negative impact of trail disturbance on soils has been found to reduce species richness and abundance (Ballantyne &amp; Pickering, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015a</xref>,
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015b</xref>; Lucas‐Borja et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). It is well documented that soil conditions can influence facilitative and competitive species interactions and therefore be drivers of species community composition (e.g., Gross et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). This holds in our system as well, with SWC increasing species richness and percent vegetation cover. SOM and SWC in turn are both are negatively affected by disturbance and positively affected by the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>. However, the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions does not mitigate this disturbance effect, as seen by decreased species richness and diversity in cushions. These negative impacts of disturbance on the soil environment provide a possible mechanistic explanation of why disturbance reduces species richness and diversity in both cushions and control areas.
