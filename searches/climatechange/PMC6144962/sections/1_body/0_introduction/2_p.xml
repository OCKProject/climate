<p class="p">Expected shifts in species geographic distributions in response to climate change have spurred numerous studies to determine which abiotic (e.g., climatic) and biotic (e.g., competitive and facilitative) processes determine range limits and affect population performance (Sexton, McIntyre, Angert, &amp; Rice, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). One topic of these studies is understanding the effects of disturbance regimes and potential shifts in disturbance patterns with climate change. However, despite their significant potential to alter competitive balances or override climatic effects, the role of localized anthropogenic factors (e.g., site‚Äêspecific disturbance regimes) in shaping range limits, including their interactions with broader climate changes, remains surprisingly understudied (Turner, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). To predict how populations at range limits will respond in an era of climate warming, it is therefore crucial to understand how the cumulative effects of local disturbance, climate, and species interactions influence population parameters. This is especially relevant in systems where declining performance of threatened trailing edge (i.e., warmer climatic edge) populations could cause range contractions, such as for species that occur across substantial elevational gradients. For these species, effects of local disturbance would be expected to interact with the known negative effects of encroachment of lower elevational, more competitive, species (Alexander, Diez, &amp; Levine, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) in ways that could either stabilize lower range limits or, conversely, cause them to fail such that the entire range shifts upward in response to climate change.
