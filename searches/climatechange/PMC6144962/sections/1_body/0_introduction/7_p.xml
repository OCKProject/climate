<p class="p">In order to address the question of how disturbance can influence range limits, we focused on the biotic to abiotic gradient often present along elevational gradients in alpine ecosystems. While disturbances can be short‐ to long‐term and natural or anthropogenic in origin, we studied the margins of human‐made trails, which represent frequent, relatively high‐intensity disturbances that are similar to livestock trails. Livestock trails are, however, more damaging, not only because livestock exert more pressure on the ground, but also because livestock herds create multiple trails (Barros et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We specifically examined trail‐side and off‐trail plant communities in a system known to exhibit facilitative and competitive interactions along elevational gradients in the Swiss Alps. To assess the net effects of disturbance on such interactions, we quantified performance indicators of the well‐studied facilitative common alpine cushion plant species,

 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), and quantified community measures of its inside (plants growing within cushions) and neighboring (plants growing next to cushions) species. Collecting data on the responses of a facilitative species as well as its inside and neighboring species allowed us to better understand (a) how disturbance influences survival, growth, and reproduction indicators of this individual facilitative species and (b) how this community and its interactions are altered by disturbance. Specifically, we tested the following hypotheses:

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">(a) At low elevations, presumably characterized by low abiotic stress and increased competition, disturbance will largely benefit cushion plant growth (as indicated by size of plants). At abiotically stressful high elevations, disturbance will have net negative effects. (b) Disturbance may, however, have a negative effect on population density at all elevations, possibly due to low establishment and survival of younger plants.</p>

   <p class="p">Higher abundance of species inside disturbed cushions will have negative effects on cushion plant reproduction at all elevations.</p>

   <p class="p">Facilitation by cushion plants will be stronger and more important in maintaining species diversity in disturbed areas, an effect amplified at higher elevations.</p>
