<p class="p">Trailing edge populations are particularly threatened by the impacts of climate change, with possible mechanisms including increasingly warm temperatures and encroachment by formerly restricted lower latitude or lower elevation species (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). In mountain systems, where lower and upper limits are often believed to be set by biotic and abiotic factors, respectively (e.g., Ettinger, Ford, &amp; HilleRisLambers, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), such encroachment can result in lower elevational range contractions (e.g., Kopp &amp; Cleland, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This pattern in turn relies on lower elevation species having higher competitive abilities than those characteristically living at higher elevations. If this pattern holds, we would expect that alpine species would be unable to maintain their lower elevational limits in the face of increased competition resulting from climate change. However, this set of processes may be moderated by multiple other factors, including local disturbance. In particular, it is unclear how the biotic interactions that influence species range limits will shift with climate change, and particularly how the strength of these interactions will be altered by disturbances.
