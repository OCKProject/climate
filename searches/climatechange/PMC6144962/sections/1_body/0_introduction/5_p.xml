<p class="p">While disturbance may reduce competitive interactions at lower elevational limits, we would expect quite different effects at higher elevations. The facilitative effects of cushion plants, in particular, is generally believed to increase along elevational gradients, as they provide the necessary microhabitat for hosted species living within the cushions at high elevations characterized by increased abiotic stress (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). These nurse plants may therefore play an important role in maintaining high species diversity around the globe (Butterfield et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, studies suggesting that cushion plants augment overall species richness (e.g., Cavieres, Hernandez‐Fuentes, Sierra‐Almeida, &amp; Kikvidze, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) have been countered by other work showing that cushion species actually host less‐diverse communities than surrounding areas (e.g., Dvorsky et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Considering that disturbance is a form of abiotic stress, we expect alpine facilitator species to host increased species not only because these facilitators provide a more sheltered microhabitat, but also because of the reduced resistance of facilitator species to other species. This is especially likely at higher elevations, where abiotic stress is known to play a large part in determining ecological processes.
