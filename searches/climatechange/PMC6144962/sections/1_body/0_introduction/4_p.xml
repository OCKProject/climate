<p class="p">Disturbance has long been recognized as an important driver of ecosystem dynamics (e.g., Connell, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1978</xref>), and high‐intensity disturbance can exert significant organismal damage (Barros &amp; Pickering, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Disturbance interacts strongly with multiple biotic processes (see Pickett &amp; White, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref> for review, pp. 287–316) and can even override the effects of climate (Franklin, Serra‐Diaz, Syphard, &amp; Regan, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). It can determine distributional patterns, such as in the cases of recurring fires (Sousa, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1984</xref>) or through changes in landscape patch structure (Pickett &amp; White, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>; p. 309). Anthropogenic disturbances can broaden the range in which non‐native species can grow (Lembrechts et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), favor invasive species richness (Sandoya, Pauchard, &amp; Cavieres, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and cause distributional shifts in invasive species (e.g., McKenzie, Yoshida, &amp; Unsworth, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Given its influential role in invasive species range expansion, it is therefore surprising that disturbance is often left out of most studies of native species range limits. This limits a comprehensive understanding of how disturbance affects range‐limiting mechanisms, or how such interactive effects will respond to global climate change. We would expect that disturbance will influence range limits, in particular for species such as many alpine plant species that are limited by competition at their lower elevational range limit (Choler, Michalet, &amp; Callaway, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). In abiotically benign areas, where facilitative effects of alpine species are marginal (Callaway et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), competitive interactions dominate ecosystem processes. If disturbance reduces competitive interactions by reducing the density of dominant competitors, we might expect alpine species to exhibit enhanced performance or density with moderate disturbance, possibly stabilizing lower range limits in the face of climate change. Of course, this effect will only occur if disturbance is not so intense as to exert strong direct negative effects on alpine species themselves.
