<p class="p">To the extent that disturbance alters community interactions, such as facilitation and competition, it could have strong indirect effects on community assembly and species diversity. There is evidence that disturbance can affect facilitative and competitive interactions, such as reducing facilitator species’ reproductive output and increasing hosted species presence (Michalet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). On the other hand, facilitative interactions can break down with high levels of abiotic stress (for review see Michalet &amp; Pugnaire, 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Not only do we lack a clear picture of which environmental factors influence these interactions, but we also do not have a comprehensive understanding of the role that disturbance plays on species interactions along biotic and abiotic stress gradients, and how this influences species range limits.
