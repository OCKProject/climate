<p class="p">To test these hypotheses, we measured 
 <italic class="italic">Silene acaulis</italic> (henceforth, 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>) populations and species community structure along elevational range locations at sites frequently disturbed by human trampling (i.e., hiker trails) vs. relatively undisturbed (i.e., off‐trail) areas in southeast Switzerland. We additionally measured two soil parameters (soil organic matter and soil water content) to understand how disturbance alters habitat conditions. 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> is an ideal model species for this work, as it is a common circumboreal alpine plant with important facilitative effects on other vegetation (Butterfield et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34276-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Its widespread distribution and facilitative effects make it an important alpine species across the Northern Hemisphere, and drivers of change to its populations, such as disturbance, need to be examined in order to improve our understanding of how to maintain alpine biodiversity in the face of impacts by multiple interactions.
