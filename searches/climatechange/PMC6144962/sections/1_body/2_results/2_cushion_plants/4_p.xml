<p class="p">In model sets testing the effects of SOM and SWC, which replaced species community parameters, we found that higher values in both soil parameters relate to decreased 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> reproductive measures. SWC decreases fruit density and SOM moderately decreases relative reproduction, with a negative effect of disturbance on fruit density (Supporting Information Table A5a in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). In these models, fruit density is highest at both upper and lower elevational range edges, and relative reproduction decreases with elevation. The best model for cushion size has no significant explanatory variables.
