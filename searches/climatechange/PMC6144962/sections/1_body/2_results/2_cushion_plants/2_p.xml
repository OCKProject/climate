<p class="p">We predicted that disturbance will benefit cushion plant growth at low elevations and have a net negative effect at high elevations (Hypothesis 1a), and have a negative effect on population density at all elevations (Hypothesis 1b). We found that disturbed and undisturbed 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> individuals have significantly different sizes (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a) as well as different size distributions (Supporting Information Figure A2 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>), with disturbed areas having much larger maximum plant sizes and undisturbed areas having more small individuals. While these results suggest benefits for plant growth from disturbance, our models indicate a possible role of disturbance in decreasing population density. Although the most parsimonious model for 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> population density indicates that density is highest in the middle of 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic>'s elevational range and does not include a disturbance effect (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>A, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b), the full model set indicates a moderate negative effect of disturbance on population density (AICc weighted average ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> value = 0.78). 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> mean cushion sizes are increased by disturbance (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>A; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c), implying older age of plants, faster growth rates, or both. This relatively weak effect is largest in the middle of the species’ elevational range (level 3), with a significant disturbance by elevation interaction supported by model selection (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). Compared to undisturbed cushions, disturbed cushions were on average 128% larger at middle elevations (level 3) but only 30% larger at range edges (levels 1, 2 and 4).
