<p class="p">We further predicted that higher abundance of species inside disturbed cushions will have negative effects on reproduction at all elevations (Hypothesis 2). We found that 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> reproduction is best explained by models with neighboring, but not inside, community indices (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>B). Both disturbance and neighboring species diversity significantly reduce fruit density (although not neighboring species abundance, as measured by percent cover), with a significant disturbance by diversity interaction effect (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Contrary to our expectations, fruit density is not influenced by any inside species measures, and neither inside nor neighboring species measures have a significant effect on relative reproduction.
