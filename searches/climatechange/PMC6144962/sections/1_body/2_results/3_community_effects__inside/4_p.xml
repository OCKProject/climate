<p class="p">We found that inside community competitiveness is significantly lower at higher elevations, with no effect of cushion presence and disturbance (Supporting Information Figure A4a, Table A6 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). This pattern is most likely not driven by certain highly competitive individual species alone, but rather by the average competitive index values found at overall median species richness (Supporting Information Figure A5a in Appendix
