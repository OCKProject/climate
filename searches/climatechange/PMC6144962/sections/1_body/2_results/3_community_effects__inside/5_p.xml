<p class="p">After including the sampled soil parameters as predictor variables in our models, we found that higher values of SWC are related to higher inside species community richness and percent vegetation cover, but SWC has no effect on diversity (Supporting Information Table A5b in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). Higher SOM values decrease species richness and percent vegetation cover, and SOM also has no effects on diversity. Both species richness and percent vegetation cover are increased with disturbance and are highest at middle elevations, with a 4‐way interaction (SOM × SWC × disturbance × elevation) present for both. These soil parameters, in turn, are negatively influenced by disturbance, both peak at middle elevations, and are positively affected by
