<p class="p">We predicted that facilitation by cushion plants will be stronger and more important in maintaining species diversity in disturbed areas, an effect amplified at higher elevations (Hypothesis 3). However, we did not find an amplified facilitative effect on inside species by 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions in disturbed areas, or support for any other interaction between cushion presence and disturbance (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). In contrast to findings of some previous studies, cushion presence has a significant negative effect on species richness (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a,c), and a moderate negative effect on both Shannon diversity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b,d) and percent vegetation cover (Supporting Information Figure A3a,c in Appendix
