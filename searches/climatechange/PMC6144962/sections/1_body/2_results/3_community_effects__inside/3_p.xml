<p class="p">As expected, we found that disturbance exerts an overall negative effect on both the species richness and diversity of inside species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Although disturbance has an overall net positive effect on percent vegetation, visual interpretation of the three‐way interaction with elevational level and area demonstrates that disturbance effects are weak at low and high elevations but strongly negative at middle elevations (for additional analysis see Supporting Information Table B6 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). All three community measures of inside species are highest at middle elevations and increase with sampling area. The interaction effect of area for all three community measures is likely due to larger cushion sizes (and therefore larger sampling areas) in disturbed areas, and varying cushion sizes across elevations.
