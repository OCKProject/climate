<p class="p">As for inside species, we did not find evidence that facilitation by 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> cushions on neighboring species increases with disturbance (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34276-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Surprisingly, 
 <italic class="italic">Silene</italic> presence has a moderate negative effect on species richness (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a,c) and percent vegetation cover (Supporting Information Figure A3b,d in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). As expected, we found an overall moderate negative effect of disturbance on both species richness and Shannon diversity, with the effects of disturbance on diversity most pronounced at middle elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b,d). As for inside communities, neighboring species richness peaks at middle elevations, and Shannon diversity decreases with elevation. Both neighboring species richness and percent vegetation cover decrease with sampling area. Disturbance has an overall positive effect on vegetation cover, but as seen through visual interpretation of the three‐way interaction with elevational level and area, disturbance exerts weak effects at low and high elevations with strong negative effects at middle elevations (for additional analysis see Supporting Information Table B6 in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>).
