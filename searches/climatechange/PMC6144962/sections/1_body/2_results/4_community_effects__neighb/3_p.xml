<p class="p">We found that neighboring species community competitiveness is highest at middle elevations, with no influence by disturbance (Supporting Information Figure A4b in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). As with inside species, we suspect that this pattern is driven by sampling areas that exhibit median species richness (Supporting Information Figure A5b in Appendix
