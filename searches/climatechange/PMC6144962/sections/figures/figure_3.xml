   </italic> (a) Disturbed sites have smaller numbers of small 
   <italic class="italic">Silene acaulis</italic> individuals, and increased numbers of larger individuals (12 largest sizes removed to improve figure clarity). Population density (b) is highest at the center of the species range (levels 2 and 3), with no effect of disturbance in the most parsimonious model but a moderate negative disturbance effect over the full model set (colors as in (a)). Disturbance increases 
   <italic class="italic">Silene acaulis</italic> mean cushion sizes (c, colors as in (a)). The best supported model for cushion size (d) includes a positive disturbance effect, a negative unimodal elevation effect, and a significant disturbance by elevation effect. This suggests that although disturbance benefits cushion growth at middle elevations (level 3), it greatly inhibits it at the upper elevational range limit (level 4). Contrasting colors merely differentiate parameters
