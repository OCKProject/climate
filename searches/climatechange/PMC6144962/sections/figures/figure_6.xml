   <bold class="bold">Neighboring species community</bold>. Disturbance reduces neighboring species richness (a) and diversity (b) (colors as in FigureÂ 
   <xref rid="ece34276-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a), with an additional negative effect of cushion presence and area on richness. The best supported model for species richness (c) highlights the importance of interactions between disturbance and elevation, whose effects synergistically interact to decrease richness at middle elevations (levels 2 and 3; see also Supporting Information Table B6 in Appendix 
   <xref rid="ece34276-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>), an effect partly mitigated by the interaction between elevation and area. The most parsimonious model for species diversity (d) indicates a negative effect of disturbance and level, with no effect of cushion. Contrasting colors merely differentiate parameters
