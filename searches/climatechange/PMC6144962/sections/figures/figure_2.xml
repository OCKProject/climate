   <bold class="bold">Sampling design</bold>. The black curved line represents a hiking trail at a SITE, and stars indicate sampling locations along 
   <italic class="italic">Silene acaulis</italic>’ local elevational range. Black rectangles delineate each PLOT, and the smaller, inner red rectangle within the plot was used to calculate population density at both off‐trail and trail‐side plots. Green circles are cushion plants (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30 per plot), and each plot had randomly chosen focal cushions for CUSHION/CONTROL pairs (
   <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5 per plot). Gray circles represent the 5 cm sampling belt outside cushion and control (inner green circle) area. Cartoon plants are other vegetation, with purple cartoons measured as inside species and orange cartoons as neighboring species. Gray cartoons were not measured as they were outside the sampling area. See text for additional details
