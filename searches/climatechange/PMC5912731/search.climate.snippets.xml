  <result pre="of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change. This paper is thus the first to examine"/>

  <result pre="or the creation of new forest carbon sinks through avoided" exact="deforestation" post="(i.e., the permanent removal of forest and change to"/>
  <result pre="forest where none has existed for some time). However, because" exact="deforestation" post="rates in BC are comparatively low, especially in relation"/>
  <result pre="tropical regions [ 19, 20], the opportunities associated with avoided" exact="deforestation" post="and afforestation [ 21] are scarce in BC. Second,"/>

  <result pre="on cognitive and value-based dimensions of environmental, forest management and" exact="climate" post="risk perception more broadly can provide ideas as to"/>
  <result pre="preference for specific forest management strategies in the context of" exact="climate" post="change. The next section provides the theoretical basis and"/>

  <result pre="46]. This notion is at the forefront of discussions around" exact="climate" post="change, leading to the belief that risk perception is"/>
  <result pre="determinant of the public’s willingness to take actions to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change [ 47– 49]. Research in this domain has"/>
  <result pre="shown that the public generally perceives the threats posed by" exact="climate" post="change as less important than the scientists do, especially"/>
  <result pre="is linked to the vague and seemingly distant features of" exact="climate" post="change, both spatially and temporally. Consequently, studies increasingly highlight"/>
  <result pre="both shaping risk perception and willingness to act in mitigating" exact="climate" post="change [ 52– 54]. In effect, the likelihood that"/>

  <result pre="their knowledge of environmental issues such as forest management and" exact="climate" post="change is often identified as one of the main"/>
  <result pre="showing that higher knowledge can actually reduce risk perception of" exact="climate" post="change [ 57, 58] or of forest pest outbreaks"/>
