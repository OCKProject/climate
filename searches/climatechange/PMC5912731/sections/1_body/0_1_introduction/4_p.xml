<p class="p">A previous survey evaluating the prioritization of values of six forest-dependent communities in BC in the context of sustainable forest management found high recognition of the importance of reducing climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, no study to date has explored public opinion regarding forest management strategies specifically designed for their potential to mitigate climate change and the factors that influence their acceptance. Thus, while we now have increasingly clear ideas of the management opportunities associated with forest mitigation in British Columbia [

 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], and some insight into public support for climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable forest management [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], very little is known with respect to the levels and basis of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate climate change. This paper is thus the first to examine and document the level of support in the BC population at large and examine how demographic characteristics as well as explanatory variables derived from the literature on cognitive and value-based dimensions of risk perception (i.e., environmental values, knowledge, trust in decision-makers, perceived climate risks and preferred objectives of forest management) influence support for different types of mitigation strategies.
