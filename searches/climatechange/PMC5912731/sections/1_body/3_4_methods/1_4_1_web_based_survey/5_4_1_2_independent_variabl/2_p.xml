<p class="p">Second, we evaluated respondents belief on the 
 <italic class="italic">cause of climate change</italic> (i.e., humans and/or natural processes; a question adapted from Leiserowitz et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]). We used this question to exclude from the analysis the respondents who believe that climate change is not happening (n = 16). Furthermore, we assessed the respondentsâ€™ levels of 
 <italic class="italic">knowledge of climate change in the context of forests and their management</italic> by having them rate their knowledge of four topics related to forest management in the context of climate change on five-point interval scale questions. While self-reported knowledge is sometimes criticized for inaccurately representing the actual knowledge of survey participants [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>], it is still widely used and was shown to be as effective as cross-examination with true or false questions [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. We chose to use self-reported knowledge over other options (i.e., quiz with true/false questions) to limit the length of the survey, but we acknowledge the potential limitations of this strategy.
