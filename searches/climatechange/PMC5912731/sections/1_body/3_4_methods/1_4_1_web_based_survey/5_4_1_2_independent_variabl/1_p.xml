<p class="p">Based on the literature review, we assessed the influence of various independent variables on the levels of support for the different strategies (complete questions can be found in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0195999.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>). First, respondents rated seven questions on their levels of concerns towards, and expected harm from, climate change using five-point interval scale questions. An aggregated average index on 
 <italic class="italic">risk perception of climate change</italic> was assigned to each respondent. In order to test the relationship between risk perception and willingness to act, and to evaluate if forest carbon mitigation is equally valued compared to other sectors, we also had respondents, using five-point ordinal scale questions, identify how important they think it is to deal with climate change mitigation in BC both: 1) across all sectors and 2) in the forest sector specifically. We also asked respondents to indicate how many times they experienced natural disasters or extreme weather events that they associated with climate change in the last 10 years.
