<p class="p">Two factors of environmental values were extracted using a subsequent factor analysis, with latent meanings being attributed to anthropocentric and biocentric value orientations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195999.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Each respondent was assigned two indices to be used in the regressions by averaging the score of each statement that loaded on each of the two factors. On average, respondents showed a greater biocentric (mean = 4.3, standard deviation = 0.64, α = 0.83) than anthropocentric orientation (M = 2.1, SD = 0.86, α = 0.76), with significant difference between the means of the two averages (t(2725) = -81.27, p&lt;0.001). This result is consistent with other studies that have observed the rise in importance of environmental values and forest conservation observed in North America, generally [
