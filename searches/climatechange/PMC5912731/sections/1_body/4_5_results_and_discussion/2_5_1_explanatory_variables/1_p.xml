<p class="p">Approximately half of the respondents (n = 735) believed that climate change is mostly caused by human activities. This finding is similar to the 52% found in a 2015 study in the United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] and higher than a recent estimate for BCâ€™s population (42%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. The rest of our respondents either indicated that climate change was caused equally by natural changes in the environment and human activities (40.5%; n = 601), was caused mostly by natural changes in the environment (7.9%; n = 117) or that it was not happening (1.1%; n = 16; excluded from the analysis). Accordingly, a large proportion of our respondents believe that climate change is mostly or partly caused by human activities (90.5%), which is considerably higher than in the United States (57%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] or the estimate recently calculated for BC (62%) [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. For the regression analysis, each of the respondents was assigned a binary variable to identify who believes and who does not believe that climate change is caused mostly by human activities.
