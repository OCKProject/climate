<p class="p">Prior to discussing the effects of the independent variables in this analysis, it is worth noting an interesting ancillary finding related to a divergence in how the two regression models fit the data and predict support. In effect, although the F-values of both models were significant, the regression model associated with conservation strategies (adjusted

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.10), suggesting that variables other than the ones used in the models may better explain support for enhanced forest management strategies.
