<p class="p">On average, respondents supported all eight of the climate mitigation strategies presented (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195999.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Two class of mitigation strategies emerged from a factor analysis (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195999.t006" class="xref">Table 6</xref>): factor 1 describes similar level of support for mitigation strategies oriented towards conservation (hereafter, “conservation strategies”), whereas factor 2 describes support for enhanced management and the use of harvested wood products (hereafter, “enhanced forest management strategies”). All mitigation strategies clearly loaded into one of the two factors except for rehabilitation (loading of 0.418 with conservation strategies against 0.407 with enhanced forest management strategies). Consequently, rehabilitation was not aggregated in any of the two factors and was, therefore, excluded from the regression analysis.
