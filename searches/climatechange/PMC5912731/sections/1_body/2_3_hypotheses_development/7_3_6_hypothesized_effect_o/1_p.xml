 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0195999.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes the expected directionality of the variablesâ€™ effect on levels of support for forest carbon management strategies, as identified in our literature review of the cognitive and value-based dimensions of risk perception. Because the possible strategies offer variation in terms of their levels of human intervention, we made a distinction between strategies with relatively less (e.g., conservation, reduction in harvest) and more human intervention (e.g., improved commercial harvesting techniques).
