<p class="p">An individual’s prioritized objectives of forest management can also contribute to explaining whether or not he or she will support or oppose different practices. As Aubin et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] explain, referring to a case study of climate change adaptation in Canada’s forests, “the debate has moved beyond a strict scientific discussion into the arena of beliefs, values, visions of the future, and subjective perceptions of risk and desirable outcomes”. In the context of climate change mitigation in forests, objectives can be defined as what really matters when thinking about forest carbon mitigation; they represent what is prioritized by each individual [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. An objective often represents an expression of citizens’ beliefs and values [

 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. For instance, an individual who prioritizes biodiversity conservation will most likely support conservation-based mitigation strategies. On the contrary, individuals focusing on economic productivity of forests will presumably support mitigation strategies oriented towards economic development and timber productivity.
