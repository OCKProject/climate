<p class="p">Because of the important influence of values on preferences for environmental and risk management scenarios, numerous scales have been created and used for the purpose of evaluating public environmental values [

 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. They are often situated somewhere on a continuum ranging from anthropocentric to biocentric, as observed in the Forest Value Scale first developed by Steel et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and regularly used since [
