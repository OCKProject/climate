  <title class="title">A conceptual framework highlighting the variables that affect level of support for conservation and forest management mitigation strategies.</title>
  <p class="p">Positive (blue boxes) and negative (red boxes) signs respectively indicate positive and negative impact on level of support. Lighter (p â‰¤ 0.05), medium (p&lt;0.01) and darker (p&lt;0.001) colour shading refer to the calculated probabilities (p-values) of the variables in the linear regression. Dotted boxes identify variables that did not significantly factor into the regressions, but were correlated with risk perception of climate change.</p>
