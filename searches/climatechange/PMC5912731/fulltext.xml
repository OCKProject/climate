The successful implementation of forest management activities to achieve climate change mitigation in British Columbia will be strongly influenced by public support or opposition. While we now have increasingly clear ideas of the management opportunities associated with forest mitigation and some insight into public support for climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable forest management, very little is known with respect to the levels and basis of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate climate change. This paper, by describing the results of a web-based survey, documents levels of public support for the implementation of eight forest carbon mitigation strategies in British Columbia&#x02019;s forest sector, and examines and quantifies the influence of the factors that shape this support. Overall, respondents ascribed a high level of importance to forest carbon mitigation and supported all of the eight proposed strategies, indicating that the British Columbia public is inclined to consider alternative practices in managing forests and wood products to mitigate climate change. That said, we found differences in levels of support for the mitigation strategies. In general, we found greater levels of support for a rehabilitation strategy (e.g. reforestation of unproductive forest land), and to a lesser extent for conservation strategies (e.g. old growth conservation, reduced harvest) over enhanced forest management strategies (e.g. improved harvesting and silvicultural techniques). We also highlighted multiple variables within the British Columbia population that appear to play a role in predicting levels of support for conservation and/or enhanced forest management strategies, including environmental values, risk perception, trust in groups of actors, prioritized objectives of forest management and socio-demographic factors.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hoberg</surname><given-names>George</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000155</institution-id><institution>Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1329-0954</contrib-id><name><surname>Peterson St-Laurent</surname><given-names>Guillaume</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding for this study was provided by the Forest Carbon Management Project of the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions (PICS): <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pics.uvic.ca">http://www.pics.uvic.ca</ext-link>.

The management of forest ecosystems has the potential to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and/or increase carbon removals from the atmosphere [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is also important to consider mitigation opportunities from increasing the carbon stored in wood products [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and increasing substitution of wood products for other products and fossil fuels whose production and use cause more greenhouse gases emissions on a life-cycle basis [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Consequently, policy makers and forest managers are now increasingly considering forest carbon as another value to be managed in the forests in addition to other benefits such as timber supply, employment, biodiversity and water conservation.</p><p>As for many other jurisdictions, the role of forest management in mitigating climate change is a central concern for the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC), where more than 60% of the territory&#x02019;s 95 million hectares is forested [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The province&#x02019;s recently announced Climate Leadership Plan indicates that &#x0201c;we can harness this opportunity to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in this tremendous public asset [forests] through intensive forest management practices and storing carbon in long-lived wood products&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the same time, a recent study identified a number of barriers to the implementation of carbon mitigation policies in BC forests (e.g. forest carbon management not explicitly addressed in forest and climate policies) and concluded that BC has thus far enacted very few forest carbon mitigation policies in practice [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Designing mitigation options for BC involving forests will require assessment of management alternatives that are informed by scientific understanding (e.g. carbon modelling) and an in-depth understanding of policy gaps (e.g., modest coverage of forest carbon in existing policies). However, the successful implementation of forest management to achieve climate change mitigation will also be strongly influenced by public support or opposition. The acceptance of new resource management and climate policies often rely on the need for the general public to understand, accept and perceive them as effective, fair and legitimate [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This is particularly the case for BC&#x02019;s forests, which have been since the 1980&#x02019;s at the center of disputes over their management and conservation (e.g., Clayoquot Sound, Great Bear Rainforest [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]). Furthermore, the recent purchase by the provincial government of carbon credits originating from controversial BC-based forest carbon offset projects has already been publicly criticized, thereby attracting media attention and making forest carbon management a contentious issue [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>A previous survey evaluating the prioritization of values of six forest-dependent communities in BC in the context of sustainable forest management found high recognition of the importance of reducing climate change [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, no study to date has explored public opinion regarding forest management strategies specifically designed for their potential to mitigate climate change and the factors that influence their acceptance. Thus, while we now have increasingly clear ideas of the management opportunities associated with forest mitigation in British Columbia [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and in Canada [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and some insight into public support for climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable forest management [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], very little is known with respect to the levels and basis of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate climate change. This paper is thus the first to examine and document the level of support in the BC population at large and examine how demographic characteristics as well as explanatory variables derived from the literature on cognitive and value-based dimensions of risk perception (i.e., environmental values, knowledge, trust in decision-makers, perceived climate risks and preferred objectives of forest management) influence support for different types of mitigation strategies.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>2 Policy background: Forest carbon mitigation in BC</title><p>Forest ecosystems and products made from wood comprise various reservoirs that store, capture or release carbon. Activities that reduce emissions or increase removals compared to business-as-usual or &#x0201c;baseline&#x0201d; levels are considered climate change mitigation actions. First, climate change mitigation can be achieved through the conservation of existing or the creation of new forest carbon sinks through avoided deforestation (i.e., the permanent removal of forest and change to non-forest land uses) and afforestation (i.e. the creation of new forest where none has existed for some time). However, because deforestation rates in BC are comparatively low, especially in relation to tropical regions [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the opportunities associated with avoided deforestation and afforestation [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] are scarce in BC.</p><p>Second, forest carbon density, referring to the amount of carbon per hectare of forest, can be maintained or increased through forest management strategies. Such actions involve the trade-offs between: (1) natural forest conservation and reduced harvest strategies and (2) forest harvesting and sustainable forest management. Conservation strategies provide potential mitigation benefits because natural forests typically store more carbon than managed forests because of their longer disturbance cycles and greater proportion of older stands [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In contrast, strategies focused on timber harvesting and more intensive forest management offer mitigation potential associated with increased forest carbon uptake rates (e.g., genetically improved seeds), improved harvesting techniques (e.g., avoided slashburning, maximized utilization at harvest) and enhanced production of long-lived wood products, which in turn can increase substitution benefits [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The frequency of occurrence of natural disturbances represents an important factor to consider when defining such forest management strategies [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. While conservation practices that maintain carbon stocks will be challenging in areas facing frequent natural disturbances, such as BC&#x02019;s boreal and interior forests [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], better opportunities are encountered in ecosystems characterized by infrequent natural disturbance patterns and high carbon density, such as the coastal temperate rainforest [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>Third, strategies that focus on the use of wood products can also be effective at increasing carbon removals and reducing greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere. To analyse the impact of wood products on atmospheric carbon, one has to evaluate a product&#x02019;s whole life cycle, from extraction to end-of-life management and potentially beyond [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In particular, the time over which carbon is stored in wood products depends greatly on their life duration. Some wood products have very short useful half lives, such as paper (2.5 years), whereas others have longer-term carbon storage potential such as the lumber encountered in single family homes (&#x0003e;90 year half-life) and commercial buildings (&#x0003e;75 years) [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Wood products can also be used as substitute for other products, so as to offset emissions from more energy-intensive products such as concrete and steel (i.e., material substitution) or fossil fuels such as coal and natural gas (i.e., energy substitution) [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>3 Hypotheses development</title><p>While public opinion on forest carbon mitigation has not been widely documented thus far, insights from the literature on cognitive and value-based dimensions of environmental, forest management and climate risk perception more broadly can provide ideas as to which variables are likely to influence public preference for specific forest management strategies in the context of climate change. The next section provides the theoretical basis and motivations for our survey design. In particular, we present a brief synthesis of key insights from relevant literatures to justify the set of variables that were selected for this study.</p><sec id="sec004"><title>3.1 Environmental values</title><p>Forests in Canada and in BC, as in many other parts of the world, have historically been managed for the purpose of a primary objective, namely timber production [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. However, forests are increasingly being managed based on multiple public values [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In particular, over the past three decades, an increase in interest in environmental values has led to a context where &#x0201c;societal worldviews fundamentally have shifted from a paradigm of subservience of nature and the environment to meet human needs to a more holistic paradigm whereby nature is perceived as having a right to exist for its own sake, regardless of its usefulness to humankind&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>Because of the important influence of values on preferences for environmental and risk management scenarios, numerous scales have been created and used for the purpose of evaluating public environmental values [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], including the New Environmental Paradigm [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the cultural theory scale [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In the context of forest management, values can be defined as &#x0201c;an individual&#x02019;s orientation toward forests&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. They are often situated somewhere on a continuum ranging from anthropocentric to biocentric, as observed in the Forest Value Scale first developed by Steel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and regularly used since [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>An anthropocentric value-orientation is associated with the perception that nature and forests represent a resource to be utilized by humans for their well-being; it mainly focuses on humans and their needs [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. As Aubin et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] explain, anthropocentric-oriented individuals generally believe that management practices that are informed by science and technology have the potential to improve forests and their productivity. In contrast, a biocentric value orientation is natured-centered, elevating &#x0201c;the requirements and values of all natural organisms, species, and ecosystems to center stage and, in some versions, makes the earth or nature as a whole the focus of &#x02018;moral considerability&#x02019;&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. While still recognizing the importance of humans, biocentrists locate them within the greater natural context and perceive nature as holding intrinsic value on its own. As such, humans have the responsibility to protect nature: &#x0201c;A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>In the context of forest management and climate change, a biocentric orientation would normally encourage practices that limit human impact on nature, whereas anthropocentric individuals would not hesitate to draw on technological solutions and the large-scale implementation or intensification of forest management strategies if it had the potential to lead to significant mitigation potential. However, the emerging discussions about climate and atmospheric changes and their increasingly important impacts on ecosystems somewhat complicates the anthropocentric versus biocentric views. In fact, climate change mitigation is about limiting the human impact on climate and hence on ecosystems in the long run. Biocentric individuals may thus justify active intervention in forests, for instance when inaction may have more damaging impacts on ecosystems than active forest management.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>3.2 Risk perception of climate change</title><p>A fundamental assumption encountered in the literature is that individuals who perceive environmental impacts as threatening will be more willing to take actions to mitigate their risks [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].

These quotas avoided an overrepresentation of certain segments of the population (e.g., living in urban centres, younger individuals more apt to respond to online survey) within the panel sample.

First, respondents rated seven questions on their levels of concerns towards, and expected harm from, climate change using five-point interval scale questions. An aggregated average index on <italic>risk perception of climate change</italic> was assigned to each respondent. In order to test the relationship between risk perception and willingness to act, and to evaluate if forest carbon mitigation is equally valued compared to other sectors, we also had respondents, using five-point ordinal scale questions, identify how important they think it is to deal with climate change mitigation in BC both: 1) across all sectors and 2) in the forest sector specifically. We also asked respondents to indicate how many times they experienced natural disasters or extreme weather events that they associated with climate change in the last 10 years.</p><p>Second, we evaluated respondents belief on the <italic>cause of climate change</italic> (i.e., humans and/or natural processes; a question adapted from Leiserowitz et al.

In each case, factors were extracted until the eigenvalue fell below 1. A minimum loading of 0.40 was used to identify which items belong to any given factor. New indexes of interval data were created by averaging the scores of each statement that loaded on the factors.

In effect, although the F-values of both models were significant, the regression model associated with conservation strategies (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.39) better explained the variance in the data than the model for the enhanced forest management strategies (adjusted <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.10), suggesting that variables other than the ones used in the models may better explain support for enhanced forest management strategies.</p><p>Divergence in respondents&#x02019; familiarity with both categories of strategies may partly explain the contrasting predictive capacity of the models. On the one hand, most people in BC are familiar with forest conservation approaches due to their prominence in public and political debates since the 1980&#x02019;s [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, forests have become a major focal point in climate discussions since the mid-2000s when the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) began considering the mitigation potential associated with reducing tropical deforestation, a mechanism that would be ultimately known as <italic>Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries</italic> (REDD+) [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref085" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref086" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Canadian environmental groups, exploiting this unprecedented attention given to forests, have further promoted the role of forests and their conservation in mitigating climate change [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref087" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref088" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref089" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. On the other hand, the mitigation potential of forest management and the use of wood products has not received as much public attention and the effectiveness of such strategies might still be widely unrecognized by the general population. This lack of public attention for the role of forest management in mitigating climate change, combined with a general unfamiliarly [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] with forestry, may explain why the enhanced forest management strategies model was weaker and more &#x0201c;random&#x0201d; in predicting support. While the variable on knowledge of climate change and forestry did not factor into the regression models, it would be interesting to test more thoroughly (e.g., quiz instead of self-reported knowledge) how variation in knowledge on specific forest management strategies affect support.</p><p>One of our main hypotheses was that respondents who are concerned about the risks and/or have personally experienced climate change would be more likely to support potential forest management strategies and accept their associated risks. However, the fact that none of the variables associated with beliefs on climate change entered in the enhanced forest management model indicates that respondents may have been even more preoccupied with the potential negative risks associated with implementation of the strategies. It is undeniable that enhanced forest management strategies are more closely related to industrial forest management, which faces criticism and opposition in certain groups of BC&#x02019;s public [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is conceivable that perceived risks and uncertainties of forestry, a variable that we did not include in our models, could have significant influence on predicting support for forest carbon mitigation actions, and more particularly enhanced forest management strategies. Based on our regression model, the profile of the respondents who are more likely to support enhanced forest management strategies&#x02014;individuals who value nature and biodiversity (i.e., biocentric orientation), but who are also more likely to accept risks when they are placed into experts&#x02019; hand (i.e., high trust in scientists and professional foresters, low education)&#x02013;is indeed suggestive of greater willingness to support policies despite risks and uncertainties.</p><p>The variables that were shown to have had an influence in our two models are illustrated as a conceptual framework in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0195999.g005">Fig 5</xref> to highlight the key findings of the analysis. Anthropocentric-oriented individuals were less likely to support conservation strategies, confirming the assumption that such a value orientation is associated with preference for resource extraction and productive strategies over conservation [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In contrast, a biocentric orientation was associated with support for both categories of mitigation, a result which is somewhat counterintuitive considering that biocentric-oriented individuals normally support conservation (e.g., protection of wildlife and old growth) and oppose more intrusive forest management strategies [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Nonetheless, as Steel et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] explain, &#x0201c;these value orientations [biocentric and anthropocentric] are not mutually exclusive (except perhaps in their most extreme forms) and are multidimensional [&#x02026;] Somewhere in between the two ends one gets a mixture of the orientations&#x0201d;. Furthermore, as hypothesized at the outset, the increasing prominence of climate change in any environmental policy debate may be compelling biocentric-oriented individuals to (re)consider more human-intensive interventions when they believe in their potential effectiveness to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and, hence, the impacts of climate change on forests [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><fig id="pone.0195999.g005" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0195999.g005</object-id><label>Fig 5</label><caption><title>A conceptual framework highlighting the variables that affect level of support for conservation and forest management mitigation strategies.</title><p>Positive (blue boxes) and negative (red boxes) signs respectively indicate positive and negative impact on level of support.

Dotted boxes identify variables that did not significantly factor into the regressions, but were correlated with risk perception of climate change.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0195999.g005"/></fig><p>Our results also highlight how trust in decision-makers and other actors diverges and can influence level of support for different strategies. Trust in the forest industry and professional foresters had a negative impact on the level of support for conservation strategies, whereas trust in environmental groups and First Nations leaders had the opposite effect, emphasizing, once again, the divide in public opinion when discussing industrial forest management and conservation in BC. In contrast, the associations found between confidence in scientists and professional foresters and support for enhanced forest management strategies confirm that individuals&#x02019; trust in these two groups increases the likelihood of supporting potential forest management practices [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Experts will have an important role to play in highlighting and disseminating the potential and limitations of different mitigation strategies and in shaping public opinions on, and approval of, future forest carbon mitigation policies.</p><p>A high perceived risk from climate change was associated with support for conservation strategies, affirming the prevailing assumption that individuals are more likely to take actions and support policies when they perceive that an environmental issue will negatively affect them [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. While knowledge of climate change in the contexts of forests and forestry did not enter into either of the two regression models, it was found to be positively correlated with risk perception of climate change (Pearson&#x02019;s r = 0.25, p&#x0003c;0.001). That being said, the low strength of association (i.e., small correlation coefficient) between the two variable seems to corroborate the conclusion that an individual&#x02019;s knowledge is a poor predictor of their risk perception, and that other demographic, contextual and normative factors have more influence (reviewed by McFarlane et al., [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]). However, it is important to acknowledge that the use of self-reported knowledge may limit our capacity to test this hypothesis.</p><p>In contrast, significant differences in the risk perception scores were found between respondents who believe climate change is mostly caused by human activities (mean = 3.76, standard deviation = 0.65) and those who did not (mean = 3.00, standard deviation = 0.80; t(1229) = -18.78, p&#x0003c;0.001), as well as between respondents that experienced events that they associate with climate change (mean = 3.66, standard deviation = 0.71) and those that did not (mean = 3.09, standard deviation = 0.83); t(1232) = 13.43, p&#x0003c;0.001). This confirms the assumptions that belief in the human causes of, and personal experiences with, climate change directly affect risk perception [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Respondents who endorsed cost and economic local impact as their highest priority generally had lesser levels of support for conservation strategies, which was also observed in other studies exploring how values affect forest management preferences [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref090" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>].</p><p>Individuals who indicated being either directly or indirectly employed by BC&#x02019;s forest sector were less likely to support both categories of strategies. This result is somewhat counterintuitive considering that some enhanced forest management strategies (e.g., bioenergy and longer-lived wood products) could arguably increase employment opportunities in the forest sector (see Xu et al. [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for socioeconomic impacts of various forest carbon mitigation strategies in BC). On the other hand, BC&#x02019;s forest sector has recently faced an economic downturn that led to a drop of 40% in employment between 2003 and 2011 [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref091" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Even though the forest sector has slowly been recuperating (i.e., employment increased by 17.6% since 2015), the recent uncertain economic climate might explain why forest sector employees prefer the <italic>status quo</italic> over the implementation of new forest management strategies with potentially uncertain economic impacts.</p><p>Finally, a conservative political orientation has a positive effect on the level of support for enhanced forest management strategies. In contrast, gender (male) and age (older individuals) have positive impacts on levels of trust for enhanced forest management strategies, whereas higher educated individuals were less likely to support these strategies. As in other studies [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], our results indicate that, on average, men (mean = 2.16, standard deviation = 0.87) and conservative individuals (mean = 2.23, standard deviation = 0.91) have respectively greater anthropocentric orientation than women (mean = 1.97, standard deviation = 0.85; t(1471) = -4.27, p&#x0003c;0.001) and liberal individuals (mean = 1.85, standard deviation = 0.80; t(805) = 6.51, p&#x0003c;0.001). Higher age and lower education is also often correlated with anthropocentric belief (idem), although no significant effect was found for these two variables in this study. As discussed elsewhere, a greater anthropocentric orientation may explain, at least partly, a lesser preference for conservation strategies. Men and older individuals have also been positively associated with lower perceived risks from forestry activity [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>], which can also explain why they are more likely to support enhanced forest management strategies.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>6 Conclusions and policy implications</title><p>In this study, we examined public levels of support for forest-based carbon mitigation strategies in British Columbia. Overall, respondents ascribed a high level of importance to forest carbon mitigation and supported all of the eight proposed strategies, indicating that the BC public is inclined to consider alternative practices in managing forests and wood products to mitigate climate change. That said, differences were found in levels of support for the mitigation strategies. In general, we found greater levels of support for a rehabilitation strategy, and to a lesser extent for conservation-focused strategies over enhanced forest management strategies. We also highlighted how demographics and explanatory variables extracted from the literature on environmental and climate risk perception appear to play a role in predicting levels of support for conservation and/or enhanced forest management strategies.</p><p>In the last decade, at least two different views have emerged from discussions on forest carbon mitigation that mirror, in many ways, the public divide observed in the 1980s. On the one hand, environmental groups have used the momentum around international efforts at reducing emissions from deforestation to push forward their conservation agenda. On the other hand, members of the forest carbon scientific community fear that criticisms made by the environmental community towards forest management practices may potentially exacerbate the &#x0201c;misunderstanding by the public that sustainable management, of which logging is a part, contributes to climate change&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref093" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>].</p><p>Nevertheless, the discourses between the two sides are increasingly converging, especially in light of the recent observed impacts that climate change is exerting on BC&#x02019;s forests (e.g., increased number and intensity of forest fires and insect epidemics). For instance, in 2010, a group of environmental organizations and worker unions published a paper that &#x0201c;advocates for a broad approach to managing our publicly-owned forest resources. It invites us to re-imagine forestry in BC, not through the traditional (and opposing) lenses of either maximizing human use, or maximizing protected areas, but rather, with a view towards maximizing carbon storage&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref094" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. While points of discord persist, an opportunity exists to initiate discussions and joint actions towards a set of comprehensive, consensus-based forest carbon mitigation policies in the province. By showing that the public is generally positively predisposed towards forest carbon mitigation, results of this study reinforce this opportunity.</p><p>In addition, notwithstanding potential divergences in preferences for other types of strategies, it is clear that the rehabilitation of areas recently affected by insects and fires is widely supported by BC&#x02019;s general public. The recent creation of the Forest Carbon Initiative announced by the BC government in its Climate Leadership Plan, which will focus on rehabilitating Mountain Pine Beetle and wildfire impacted sites [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], is, therefore, timely and should be well received by the public. Nevertheless, while the rehabilitation of such areas will definitely provide mitigation benefits, recent studies indicate that no single strategy will be able to maximize forest carbon mitigation alone; only an approach combining various practices and accounting for regionally-differentiated ecological and socio-economic features can take full advantage of BC forests&#x02019; mitigation potential [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Furthermore, various reforestation strategies that explicitly take climate change into account, such as assisted migration and assisted gene flow, can be used to rehabilitate BC&#x02019;s public forests [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref095" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref096" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Further research is needed to evaluate public preferences regarding such approaches.</p><p>Finally, our results indicate and reinforce known critical issues, particularly in terms of public trust towards government decision-makers. One way for the government to address this issue of trust would be to secure partnerships with other influential and trusted actors such as environmental organizations, First Nations leaders, and scientists. Furthermore, it will be imperative to ensure active participation of the public, First Nations, and all stakeholders for the credibility and legitimacy of decision-making processes and their outcomes, especially considering that the issues of forest management and climate change are complex and scientific in nature [<xref rid="pone.0195999.ref097" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0195999.ref098" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Further research is also needed to evaluate public opinion on how forest carbon mitigation strategies should be implemented through actual policies (e.g., voluntary carbon offsets program, changes in forest management policies and practices, climate change policies) and how the trade-offs associated with the implementation of different mitigation strategies (e.g., effectiveness at mitigating climate change vs. environmental, social and economic impacts) further affect public preferences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195999.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Overview of survey questions.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195999.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0195999.s002"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Overview of survey respondents&#x02019; demographic.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0195999.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Tugce Conger, Caren Dymond, Ghazal Ebrahimi, Alejandra Echeverri, Robert Hember, Nancy Silva Grif&#x000e9;, Stephen Sheppard and Elizabeth Williams for providing useful feedback on earlier versions of the survey.
