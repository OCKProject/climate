<p class="p">There were no significant effects of simulated climate change or microorganism exposure, but there was a significant interaction effect on overall mussel toxin-pathogen load (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Regarding immune function, there was a significant interaction between the effects of warming + hyposalinity on immunobiologcal status (measured as lysosomal membrane stability via neutral red retention; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) with immune function significantly lower in mussels exposed to warming + hyposalinity. Immunobiological status was also significantly negatively affected by all three toxin-pathogen microorganism exposures (
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio, P</italic> &lt; 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium, P</italic> = 0.001 and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium, P</italic> = 0.038) when compared to those mussels fed the non-toxic diatom (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). However, when 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> were fed together and mussels were exposed to warming + hyposalinity, the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> had a mediating effect: immunity (as neutral red retention) was significantly higher than that in mussels fed 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> only (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>). This mediating effect of 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> persisted across several metabolic parameters investigated, including oxygen consumption and ATP concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1d</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>). Mussels fed 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> always displayed values closer to those of control animals than those fed 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> only. There was no significant effect of microorganism exposure (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.323) or climate change (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.303) on gill Na
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>/K
 <sup class="sup">+</sup>-ATPase activity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1c</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). However, microorganism exposure had a significant negative effect on both glucose and glycogen concentration (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1e–f</xref>), but no effect of climate change was observed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Power analysis (the likelihood that our tests would have detected a biologically meaningful effect had it existed) showed that the GLM tests had &gt;80% power.
