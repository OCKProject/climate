<p class="p">Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) allows the partitioning of net effects into direct and indirect effects, and thus an estimation of their relative importance. Our use of SEM enabled us to disentangle any direct and indirect effects of simulated climate change and microorganism exposure on the physiological pathways which ultimately affect mussel health and overall toxin-pathogen load. Individual and multigroup SEM models were not statistically different from the observed data (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). SEM analyses revealed strong direct and indirect effects of warming and hyposalinity on mussel metabolic and immunobiological function and toxin-pathogen load (

 <italic class="italic">Vibrio, Alexandrium,</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio + Alexandrium</italic>). The most complex network of effects was observed in the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), where exposure to warming, hyposalinity, and warming + hyposalinity all had significant effects on mussel metabolic and immunobiological parameters, which led to an increase in mussel toxin-pathogen load (−0.28) compared to mussels fed non-toxic diatoms (−0.33). In mussels exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium,</italic> warming + hyposalinity had significant effects on metabolic and immunobiological function which mediated the greatest increase in mussel toxin-pathogen load (0.95) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). Unexpectedly, when mussels were fed 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> almost all direct and indirect climate change effects on mussel physiology were non-significant and there were no significant direct or indirect effects on the toxin-pathogen load (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). Furthermore, in all analyses, the direct and indirect effects of warming and hyposalinity in many cases cancelled each other out, resulting in low overall effects on the toxin-pathogen load. For example, the direct negative effect of warming on the toxin-pathogen load in the mussels exposed to 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> (0.36) was reduced to 0.08 when the positive indirect effects (0.28) were taken into consideration (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 4b</xref>). This most likely explains why the ANOVA analysis of the toxin-pathogen load found no overall significant effects of warming or hyposalinity on the total toxin-pathogen load (
