<p class="p">First, we analysed the data in each group to ensure that the basic structure of the model was consistent with the data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref>. Data were analysed by comparing models with the observed covariance matrix, using maximum likelihood and Chi-square as goodness of fit measures. Data were considered significantly different from the model when 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05. Since data from the individual groups fit the model (
 <italic class="italic">P &gt; </italic>0.05), we deemed it legitimate to perform a multigroup SEM analysis. All variables in the model were initially constrained to vary equally across all groups. Standardised residual covariances, which display the difference between sample covariance and implied covariance, were then examined to locate variable inequalities between groups. Any inequalities that differed between the four groups by &gt;2 in absolute values were relaxed (or allowed to vary freely across groups), and the analysis was run again. This stepwise procedure was performed until the model Chi-square no longer changed
