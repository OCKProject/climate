<p class="p">Since the presence of microorganisms resulted in four different scenarios (a control state with only non-toxic diatoms, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> and exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic>), data were separated into four groups – control group, 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio, Alexandrium, Vibrio</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> – and analysed with a multigroup Structural Equation Model (SEM)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. This allowed us to test whether climate change effects through the physiology and toxicity level of the mussels differed when exposed to different toxic and non-toxic microorganisms. In the multigroup SEM, we assessed the effects of three binary predictor variables – (i) warming (0/1), (ii) hyposalinity (0/1) and (iii) warming + hyposalinity (0/1) – and modelled their direct and/or indirect effects on six continuous response variables: (i) gill function, (ii) glycogen concentration, (iii) oxygen consumption, (iv) ATP concentration, (v) immunity (as lysosomal membrane stability measured as neutral red retention) and (vi) toxicity. Direct effects are when variable A will cause variable B to change (e.g. warming → O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption), whereas indirect effects are the sum of all possible variables affecting variable B (e.g., the indirect effect of warming on O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption is the product of the path between warming → gill function, gill function → O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption, warming → glycogen, glycogen → O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> consumption) (see also
