<p class="p">To investigate the combined effects of warming and hyposalinity and exposure to toxic phytoplankton and pathogenic bacteria on various aspects of physiological function in 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic> a nested orthogonal experimental design was used. This incorporated two levels of seawater temperature and two salinities within each microorganism exposure (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The two seawater temperature levels (28 °C and 32 °C) correspond to the mean monthly sea surface temperature (SST) at the collection site

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The two salinity levels (35 PSU and 31 PSU) correspond to the mean monthly sea surface salinity (SSS) at the collection site

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The four microorganism exposures used were: the non-toxic diatom
