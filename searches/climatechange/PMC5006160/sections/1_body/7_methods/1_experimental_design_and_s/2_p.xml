<p class="p">Mussels were exposed for 14 days to one of four microorganism exposures detailed above nested in combinations of the four climate change treatments: ‘control’ (28 °C + 35 PSU), ‘warming’ (32 °C + 35 PSU), ‘hyposalinity’ (28 °C + 31 PSU), or ‘warming + hyposalinity’ (32 °C + 31 PSU). For the groups exposed to warming, the water temperature in the aquaria (described above) was raised by 1 °C per day until 32 °C was achieved (day zero for all experimental exposures), by using stick heaters. Similarly, for groups exposed to hyposalinity, salinity was decreased by 1 PSU per day until 31 PSU was obtained, by adjustment with freshwater that had been filtered by reverse osmosis beforehand. Mussels were randomly divided into four groups of 256, each assigned to one of the four exposure regimes described above. Each group was further sub-divided into four groups of 64 individuals and allocated to one of the four nested climate change treatments, and then each of these were subdivided again into four groups of 16 individuals each randomly allocated to one of four replicate aquaria, thus avoiding pseudoreplication. Aquaria (volume = 20 L) were filled with aerated seawater that had previously been sand filtered and ozonated. For these smaller aquaria, temperature was maintained above ambient by placing individual aquaria into larger tanks, the water of which was heated using stick heaters, thus avoiding any difficulties in temperature regulation in a small volume. Salinity was decreased below ambient by adjustment with freshwater as before. Stocking density was at a maximum of one mussel per litre. Mussels were fed daily as per their allocated microorganism exposure. All other experimental procedures were as previously described above.</p>
