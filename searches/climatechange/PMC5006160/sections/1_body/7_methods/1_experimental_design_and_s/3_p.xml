<p class="p">At the end of the exposure period (after 14 d), the mussels from each sub-group, in each of the aquaria were subdivided into three groups (blinding not used). See 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">supporting information</xref> for full details of animal husbandry, all experimental procedures and assay protocols. Individuals in group one were weighed. Haemolymph was then taken from the posterior abductor muscle and added to an equal volume of Hepes-buffered physiological saline for use in the Neutral Red Retention Assay to assess lysosomal membrane stability and thus immunobiological status. Mussels were then opened, sexed, and the mantle tissue was rapidly dissected and immediately snap frozen for determination of levels of ATP, ADP, AMP, glucose and glycogen and thus cellular energy status. Gill tissue was also collected, added to SEI buffer and snap frozen for determination of gill function via Na
