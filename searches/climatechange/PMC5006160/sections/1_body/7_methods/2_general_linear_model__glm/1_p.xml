<p class="p">Mixed linear model tests were used to investigate the effect of microorganism exposure and climate change effects on the mean physiological traits investigated, with the term ‘tank’ as a random factor and individual body mass as covariate. If significant differences were found among different treatments, this was tested using the Tukey test. All data met assumptions for normality and for homogeneity of variances (Levene’s test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In a preliminary analysis, the terms ‘tank’ and ‘body mass’ were shown not to have a significant effect on the parameters investigated, and were therefore removed. All remaining analyses were therefore completed using GLM. All analyses were conducted in SPSS v. 22. The power of our experiments (the likelihood that our tests would have detected a biologically meaningful effect had it existed) was determined by power analysis using the program G*Power
