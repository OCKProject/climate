<p class="p">Similar behavioural and physiological responses (e.g. changes to filtration rate, valve closure, growth rate, byssus thread production and MO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) have been recorded when bivalves were exposed to toxic dinoflagellates, with the strength of these responses often varying with bivalve species, population and geographical location

 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic> behavioural responses, such as upregulation of ingestion avoidance behaviour, has been shown to result in decreased food absorption, leading to a decrease in energy supply

Despite these effects on bivalve physiology being relatively well characterised when measured separately, we still know little about possible interactions between the microorganisms on which bivalves feed and the effects of climate change on the physiological processes underpinning the health of marine shellfish. Equally, therefore, we know virtually nothing about how these interactions may affect the toxin-pathogen load of commercially important seafood
