<p class="p">In this study, we investigated how the toxin-pathogen load and the mechanisms that underpin the physiological health of the tropical, commercially important, green mussel 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic> are affected by climate change induced warming and/or hyposalinity and exposure to the pathogenic bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> (‘
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>’) and/or the PST producing dinoflagellate 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium minutum</italic> (‘
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic>’). We especially focussed on the relative importance of direct and indirect effects of these on the physiological pathways which ultimately affect mussel health and overall toxin-pathogen load, for which we used Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) (see Methods). In the area of SW India where we performed our experiment 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic> experiences seasonal spikes of high temperatures and/or lowered salinity which approach the limits of its known tolerance range
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. However, here it is unusual for mussels to experience high temperatures and/or lowered salinity concurrently at the levels used in our experiment. Mussels were maintained in mesocosms under either ambient or projected climate change conditions (warming and hyposalinity), with or without dinoflagellates and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>. Total toxin-pathogen load (PST and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> concentration) was subsequently quantified and immunobiological and metabolic aspects of mussel physiological function were examined. We hypothesised that: 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the effects of warming and hyposalinity would have detrimental effects on metabolic and immunobiological function in 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic> leading to an increase in mussel toxin-pathogen load; 
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) these effects would be magnified when mussels were also exposed to pathogenic or toxic microorganisms and; 
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) any indirect effects of warming and hyposalinity and exposure to the microbes on the physiological mechanisms would be at least as strong as the direct effects.
