<p class="p">Mussels exposed to warming had reduced glycogen concentrations, oxygen consumption and immune function (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). Warming also indirectly affected the toxin-pathogen load via negative effects on glycogen concentration, whereas no indirect single effects of hyposalinity were observed. This supports the assertion that warming induces changes in glycogen concentration and depletes carbohydrate reserves due to increased metabolic challenges
