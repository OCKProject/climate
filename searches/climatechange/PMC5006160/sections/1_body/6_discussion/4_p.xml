<p class="p">The largest increase in the toxin-pathogen load was seen in mussels exposed to warming + hyposalinity while simultaneously being fed the toxin producing dinoflagellate

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). Those mussels responded by upregulating their metabolic machinery; increasing oxygen consumption with both direct and indirect effects on the glycogen pool and ATP concentrations. Glycogenesis increased as did glycogenolysis. Glycolysis was also likely upregulated fuelling ATP production. Although this metabolic upregulation had a positive effect on immunity, this was not enough to prevent a large warming + hyposalinity-induced increase in the overall toxin-pathogen load, which would likely be detrimental in the long run. Prolonged challenges by PST toxins on mussels are known to cause widespread inflammatory responses and also have damaging effects on the immune system, often leading to further pathological changes and parasitic infection
