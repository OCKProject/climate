<p class="p">In our experiment, when heat-stressed mussels were fed pathogenic microorganisms, the physiological response to warming and hyposalinity changed. Significant negative effects of warming and hyposalinity on metabolic and immunobiological function were only observed when mussels were exposed to the pathogenic bacteria

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>). This was due to a direct effect of warming combined with an indirect effect of hyposalinity via upregulation of oxygen consumption and an increase in gill function. However, there were also direct negative effects on immune system function and metabolism indicated by a decline in glycogen and ATP concentrations. Collectively, these responses indicate that the mussels entered a reduced energy state, driven by the need to meet the twin challenges of maintaining immune system function and upregulating the metabolic response

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref> which suggests that temperature could have a direct effect on behaviour that could in turn play a part in regulating the toxin-pathogen load. At temperatures beyond 30 °C mussel filtration rate would likely decline and cause a concomitant decline in ingestion rate of pathogens. This could eventually lead to a decreased toxin-pathogen load - a result that we observed.
