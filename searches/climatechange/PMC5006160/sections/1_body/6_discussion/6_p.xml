<p class="p">Despite the fact that our study was medium term (14 days) and was conducted in mesocosms we saw multiple statistically significant effects of simulated climate change and microorganism exposure on the physiology of 
 <italic class="italic">P. viridis</italic>. This suggests that if this species is exposed to these combinations of conditions under future global change scenarios that there would be effects that would be detrimental to their fitness as well as to their overall toxicity. In tropical coastal regions, fish and shellfish are key sources of protein and income for local communities. In these areas even small-scale outbreaks of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> and/or PST contamination can have devastating economic and social consequences. Clearly, further work is required to understand algal-bacterial-bivalve interactions for sustainable and economic management of economically and ecologically valuable species. As a first step, our results suggest that: 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the antagonistic 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio-Alexandrium</italic> relationship may be a valuable tool in the management of seafood safety, and; 
 <italic class="italic">ii)</italic> toxic marine microbes can strongly modify the direct and indirect effects of climate change on commercially important shellfish. These findings provide a key stepping-stone toward increasing the resilience of coastal marine fisheries and aquaculture to the challenges posed by future climate change.
