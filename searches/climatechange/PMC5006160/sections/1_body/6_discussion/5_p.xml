<p class="p">Surprisingly, when we fed the mussels 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>, the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> counteracted the negative effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> on immunometabolic functions. Almost all the direct and indirect effects of warming and hyposalinity on the physiology of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> exposed mussels were non-significant when mussels were fed 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>). This pattern also applied to toxin-pathogen load. Pathogenic marine bacteria such as 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> are known to have algicidal effects on PST-producing dinoflagellates such as 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic>

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref>, and have therefore been suggested for use in the control of HABs
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. However, our results (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>) indicate that toxic dinoflagellates may also be able to ameliorate the negative effects of pathogenic marine bacteria. A similar interaction has recently been identified in clams, in which 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium tamarense</italic> reduced the effects of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio tapetis</italic>, the cause of brown ring disease
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. Several interactive mechanisms between 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> can be identified as potential explanations for our results. First 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> may be directly toxic to 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>, and secondly, exposure to 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> could have stimulated the bivalves’ cellular immune response against 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio.</italic> Our results showed a significant positive effect of gill function on immunity in mussels fed 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> + 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2D</xref>), demonstrating the increased energetic demands of upregulating immune function. Several previous studies have also reported an increase in specific components of bivalves’ cellular immune response, such as significant increases in phagocytically active cells in clams exposed simultaneously to 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. However, the exact mechanisms responsible currently remain unidentified. Our SEM analysis revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> exposure had complex and detrimental effects on metabolic and immune system function, which led to an increase in the toxin-pathogen load. Warming and hyposalinity of 
 <italic class="italic">Alexandrium</italic>-fed mussels, on the other hand, clearly affected a specific immunometabolic pathway, which facilitated an overall increase in the toxin-pathogen load.
