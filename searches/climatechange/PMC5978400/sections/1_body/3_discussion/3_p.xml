<p class="p">In the case of the guanaco in Chile, future distribution modeled here not only shows a confinement to specific zones, such as coastal and central valleys in the Atacama region (27°S), and coastal and Andes Mountains between Coquimbo (29°S) and Valparaíso (33°S) regions, but also a reduction of the distribution extent of the mixed population. This roughly coincides with a predicted 5–15% rainfall reduction for the next decades between the Copiapó River (27°S) and the Aysén river basin (47°S) (
