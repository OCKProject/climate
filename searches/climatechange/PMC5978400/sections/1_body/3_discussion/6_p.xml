<p class="p">From our results, and under the best scenario, the current location of PA will only decrease a 3% of guanaco’s protected distribution range, but will shift to lower quality habitat, as discussed above. Projected distributions models proposed in this study are by no means a prognosis of the fate of guanacos in Chile, as they outline the distribution probabilities based on possible scenarios given the future GHG emissions (

 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Buisson et al., 2010</xref>) have likely permeated our predictions (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moss et al., 2010</xref>). In fact, the net effect of our conservative forecasts may underestimate current and future species distribution both within the boundaries of Chile and beyond. For instance, the species may be influenced by a range of environmental conditions outside Chile that are currently not represented among the presence localities in Chile. Thus, when projecting the future distribution within Chile, these areas may appear as not environmentally suited for the presence of the species, altering the correct estimation for the area (or percentage) of range contraction and the area (or percentage) of the range in PA. Furthermore, addressing congruence between restricted and broad scale predictions, 
 <xref rid="ref-64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Titeux et al. (2017)</xref> suggested that local models might omit the warmest and coldest parts of future distribution, projecting a larger decrease in future species richness at warmer temperatures. Therefore, the validity of the proposed distribution of guanaco’s future range in Chile likely depends on the consistency between the environmental niche used and the values present elsewhere, as well as on the extension of guanaco’s presence in extreme temperatures areas. Understanding how these observations could translate to guanaco’s species and lineage distribution will certainly contribute to the ongoing research efforts currently underway in Argentina and Chile. Hence, it is likely that efforts to expand the sampling dataset to consider guanaco’s full range will also increase its climate niche definition and improve the predictions of the future distribution of the species. The work presented here represents a conservative view of guanaco’s range that allows the evaluation of the evolutionary aspect of niche conservatism hypotheses based on the best knowledge of the species natural history.
