Our worst-case scenario analysis suggests that the guanaco will have lost up to a fifth (∼21%) of its current geographic distribution by 2070. Although predicted changes will barely be noticeable, the classification and quantification of suitable habitat provided substantial insights on the vulnerability of this species to climate change showing that such changes will additionally result in a confinement to suboptimal quality habitats supporting general trends outlined in the literature (

In particular, our quantification of areal changes between current and future distribution under the worst-case scenario, suggested an average loss of 34%, compared to 17% of areal gains (i.e., new distribution areas available) between 2050 and 2070.
