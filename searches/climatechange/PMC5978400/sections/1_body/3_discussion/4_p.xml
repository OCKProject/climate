<p class="p">In order to better understand spatial dynamics of guanaco’s populations across their distribution range, we seeked to address whether niche conservatism or divergence prevailed under different climate change regimes. The basic assumption is that niches are diagnostic traits that help us understanding how species deal with climate-induced changes in their habitat (

 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alvarado-Serrano &amp; Knowles, 2014</xref>). For instance, sister lineages should most likely exhibit closely similar niches, and point towards PNC (

 <xref rid="ref-72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wiens &amp; Graham, 2005</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Losos, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli, 2008</xref>). Therefore, we expected to find niche similarity (i.e., PNC) between the niches of guanaco lineages. Nevertheless, we found stronger evidence for PND among 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic>, hence supporting the existence of only two ESUs for the guanaco, as proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al. (2013)</xref>: one lineage in the northwest represented by 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> and another in the southeast represented by 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">4</xref>). Two interesting results emerged when lineages’ niches were compared with the mixed population: (i) the current niche of northern 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> is similar to the current niche of the mixed population; (ii) the future niche of the southern 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> is projected to include, and resemble, the future niche of the mixed population. Nevertheless, the current niche of the mixed population does not share any statistically significant similarity with the northern nor the southern lineages (see background similarity test results in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). This suggests that 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> is, given its actual climatic requirements, more likely to adapt to current climatic conditions across the mixed population’s habitat, pointing towards the existence of PNC processes. Whereas when we look at projected climate conditions, 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> will most likely experience a future expansion of its environmental niche towards the projected mixed population’s habitat. Conversely, the mixed population will continue to limit its distribution to the small and restricted areas of northern Chile, in spite of its recent dispersal history through extant barriers (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>). In summary, PNC seems to be more important when current niches are analyzed, while PND emerges as the important process under future projections of climate change.
