<p class="p">We built a guanaco occurrence dataset of 3,321 records by complementing previous work by the authors with 359 additional records (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2013</xref>). New records were collected following the same procedures outlined in 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al. (2013)</xref>, that is, from direct and indirect evidence of guanaco presence collected between the years 2000 and 2016 across several field campaigns. Indirect evidence of guanaco occurrence was assigned to a lineage by genetic and morphological evaluation of biological samples such as feces and dead tissues. Most of new records were collected in the northern section of the country in the Arica, Parinacota (i.e., 17°S latitude) and Coquimbo region (30°S). Each record was assigned to a 1 × 1 km cell defined by the resolution of the environmental datasets employed (see below). This resulted in a total of 298 records for
