<p class="p">The areal extent for each suitability class predicted by each model, current and projected, were compared to determine habitat loss (or gains) under the various climate change scenarios evaluated. We used the software BioSARN v.1 to calculate the amount of area gained or lost and to estimate differences between models (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heap, 2016</xref>). These results were classified into three categories: (a) Areal loss, when future prediction show a decrease of the areal extension compared to current niche models; (b) Areal gain, produced when future prediction add area to current niche models; (c) Unchanged areas, when climate change predictions show no impact on current guanacoâ€™s distribution.
