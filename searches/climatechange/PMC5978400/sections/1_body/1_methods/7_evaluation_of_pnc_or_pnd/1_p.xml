<p class="p">Phylogenetic niche conservatism and phylogenetic niche divergence among lineages and the mixed population were evaluated through their current and projected niches for the most extreme scenario (i.e., RCP8.5) in 2070 using ENMTools v.1.4.3 (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli, 2010</xref>). Niche overlap between lineages was calculated with the statistical indices “
 <italic class="italic">I</italic>” (derivative of Hellinger’s distance) and “
 <italic class="italic">D”</italic> (Shöener’s D) which may take values going from 0 (i.e., no overlap) to 1 (i.e., full overlap between lineages’ niches). We used the Identity test to evaluate the hypothesis of niche equivalence (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Graham et al., 2004</xref>) and the Background similarity test to evaluate the hypothesis of niche similarity (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson, Soberón &amp; Sánchez-Cordero, 1999</xref>). The Identity test quantitatively assesses whether the niche space for two compared lineages are equivalent by comparing the actual niche to a null niche model generated from a randomized pool of locations for each lineage. This allows to effectively evaluate whether niche spaces are equal, under the premise that, if they are, they should be able to predict each other (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli, 2010</xref>). Because the Identity test strongly depends on accurate representations of species habitat suitability, it is known to be sensitive to the particular sampling scheme employed, and therefore less suitable to compare allopatric niches (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli, 2010</xref>). The Background similarity test compares the niche difference between allopatric lineages by contrasting the niche of a “focal” lineage to the niche built from the background locations of a second lineage. If there is similarity between these, the null model should predict the niche of the second lineage. We repeated each test 100 times to produce a simulated distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values and to evaluate significance using a threshold of 0.1 (two-tailed for background similarity test, and one-tail for identity test) (
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guisan, Thuiller &amp; Zimmermann, 2017</xref>). We considered outcomes as indicative of PNC between lineages when observed 
 <italic class="italic">I</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> values fell within the simulated distribution. On the other hand, when the observed values fell outside of the simulated distribution, they were assumed to be indicative of PND between lineages.
