<p class="p">We used an ensemble forecasting framework to minimize the inherent variability introduced by the various forecast models employed, as proposed by 
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Araújo &amp; New (2007)</xref>. Therefore, we generated a model from the average of each bioclimatic variable produced by the five GCMs (i.e., Bio1

 <sub class="sub">GF</sub> Bio1
 <sub class="sub">GS</sub> + Bio1
 <sub class="sub">HD</sub> + Bio1

Hence, 400 projected guanaco distribution models were generated (i.e., 2 RCPs × 2 time frames × 100 replicates). The final results are four projected climate models for
