 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips, Anderson &amp; Schapire, 2006</xref>) were used to model current and future geographic distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> and its lineages. MaxEnt uses a machine learning algorithm to generate predictions on the potential distribution of species based on their presence, pseudo-absences and a set of environmental variables. The software analyzes the multivariate distribution of environmental conditions of species occurrences to generate a spatially explicit probability map of lineage occurrence (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franklin, 2009</xref>). Such modeling approach has shown to have a good statistical performance compared to other types of modeling techniques (
 <xref rid="ref-14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al., 2006</xref>) and is currently one of the most commonly used methods to understand habitat suitability, niche structure, geographical species distribution (
