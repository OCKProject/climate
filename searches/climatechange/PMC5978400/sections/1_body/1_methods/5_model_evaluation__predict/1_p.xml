<p class="p">Generated niche models were evaluated using a threshold-independent analysis of the area under the curve (AUC) provided by the receiver operator curve (

 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anderson &amp; Raza, 2010</xref>). These sensitivity tests model accuracy by calculating the proportion of true positives versus false positives. The resulting values range from 0 to 1, where model predictions are considered fair when obtained AUC values are above 0.7 (

AUC Jackknife analysis allowed to identify the contribution of each variable to final current and future models, and to allow the detection of those variables that significantly improve predictions for the occurrences of each lineage (
