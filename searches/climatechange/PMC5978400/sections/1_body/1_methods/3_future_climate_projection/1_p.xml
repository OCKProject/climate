<p class="p">The projection of future geographic distribution of niches was performed using the outputs of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 of the IPCC’s methodology for the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (

The two extreme GHG concentration scenarios, also known as representative concentration pathway (RCP), were used to project future climate niches. RCP2.6, the most optimistic scenario, considers a lower GHG concentration and projects average increases of temperature between 0.3° and 1.6 °C with 0.26–0.55 m increases of sea levels. RCP8.5, the most pessimistic scenario, considers higher GHG concentrations with a 2.6°–4.8 °C projected increase in mean global temperature and a 0.45–0.82 m rise of sea levels (
