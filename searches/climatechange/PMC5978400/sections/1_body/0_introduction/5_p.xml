<p class="p">While the discontinuity of the current geographical distribution of guanaco is mostly a consequence of recent human activities (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2006</xref>), the macroevolutionary processes leading to lineage divergence in guanaco should be taken into consideration when deciding on the conservation actions required, as it has been discussed elsewhere for other species (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hu et al., 2015</xref>). Current threats are mostly related to high competition for fodder with cattle and introduced mammals (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mason et al., 2014</xref>); predation by feral dogs, illegal hunting, and the reduction of available habitat due to the intensification of agriculture (

 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baldi et al., 2016</xref>). The 14.5 million hectares protected by the Chilean system of protected areas (PA) does not cover the entire species range (
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baldi et al., 2016</xref>), prompting important questions regarding the future distribution of guanaco. Mostly, 
 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> is well adapted to a wide variety of habitats (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2006</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, at the intraspecific level, each lineage may respond differently to changes. As evidence from guanaco’s natural history indicates, past changes in climate have clearly influenced the geographic distribution of this species, particularly in the Altiplano and Puna where guanacos and vicuñas (
 <italic class="italic">Vicugna vicugna</italic>) compete for resources since the Holocene (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Thus, under the possible climate change scenarios in Chile, we expect 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> to expand (or to shift) southward and overlap with the mixed genetic heritage population. On the other hand, we predict that 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic>, characterized by a wider climatic tolerance (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2013</xref>), should mostly maintain its current geographic distribution.
