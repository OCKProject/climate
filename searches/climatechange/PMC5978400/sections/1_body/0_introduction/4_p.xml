<p class="p">Two distinct subspecies of guanaco (
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic>) have been proposed based on genetic studies. 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> is distributed to the west of the Central Andean Plateau throughout Peru and the northern tip of Chile with occurrences mostly explained by elevation and precipitation seasonality. 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> is found on the southeastern slope of the Andes, ranging throughout Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego with occurrences mostly explained by annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality and grass cover (

 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The geographical limit between the northwestern and southeastern lineages has been proposed to occur around 31°S in Chile (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2017</xref>) and the significant genetic structure found among the two guilds has led to recommend to classify the two lineages as evolutionary significant units (ESUs) following 
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Moritz’s (1994)</xref> criteria (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>). However, the two lineages are not completely separated from each other. In fact, some populations have individuals of both lineages forming zones of mixed genetic heritage (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>). The distribution of this mixed population is predicted to occur at the south end of the Altiplano, between 26° and 32°S approximately, and it is better explained by annual precipitation and precipitation seasonality (
 <xref rid="ref-24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González et al., 2013</xref>). As reported by 
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al. (2013)</xref>, the Andean plateau could have acted as a biogeographical and ecological barrier fostering vicariance processes that may be at the origin of the current distribution of guanaco lineages. It is presumed that climate changes that occurred in the past allowed the establishment of populations over this geographic barrier, with periods of connectivity and isolation allowing the establishment of populations with mixed genetic heritage (
