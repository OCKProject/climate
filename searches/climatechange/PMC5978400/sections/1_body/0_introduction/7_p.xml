 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> taxonomy and life history, we developed models based on niche theory to assess the impact of climate change on guanaco’s ESUs. By modeling the niche of 
 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> and its lineages we here: (a) estimated their current geographic distribution based on bioclimatic variables; (b) predicted their future distribution based on the projections of the best and worst climate change scenario at two different time frames (2050, 2070); (c) quantified the area predicted to be gained, lost, or remain stable in the future for both guanacos lineages and mixed population; (d) evaluated and compared how much of the Chilean PA will overlap with the future distribution area calculated for guanacos; and (e) explored the existence of niche conservatism or divergence between 
 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> lineages, in terms of their niche equivalence (
