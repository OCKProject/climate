<p class="p">From an evolutionary perspective, given the existence of these two lineages and the repeated suggestions of their consideration as ESUs (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marin et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baldi et al., 2016</xref>), it would be of great interest to evaluate the state of conservation of their niche to support with new evidence this classification. From such perspective, it becomes relevant to assess whether phylogenetic niche conservatism (PNC), the tendency of closely related species to differ less ecologically than expected by chance, or otherwise, phylogenetic niche divergence (PND), the tendency of closely related species to differ more ecologically than expected by chance may prevail under current and predicted niche segregation patterns under future climate change (
