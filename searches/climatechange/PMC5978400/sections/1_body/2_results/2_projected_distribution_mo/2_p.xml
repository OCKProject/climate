<p class="p">Marginal decreases of habitat suitability is observed under the RCP2.6 scenario for the years 2050 and 2070 (259,577 vs. 254,979 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively). The small areal reduction under both models is only of 6% and 7.6% of the current area. However, this decrease is more pronounced under the RCP8.5 scenarios in which a 13% and 20.7% reduction is quantified for the years 2050 and 2070, respectively (i.e., 240,505 and 218,841 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>).
