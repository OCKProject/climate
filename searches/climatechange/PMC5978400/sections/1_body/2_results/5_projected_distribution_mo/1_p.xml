<p class="p">The current network of PA in Chile covers a vast area of approximately 256,550 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, according to 2016 data, and shows a limited overlap with modeled guanaco distribution. In fact, our analysis shows that a 9.8% (i.e., 19,402 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of the species current distribution overlaps with a PA. When looking at projected distributions for 2070, our results showed that such overlap will decrease to 6.2% (15,772 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) under the best scenario (RCP2.6). Similarly, under the worst scenario (RCP8.5), the overlap will be of 5.7% (12,434 km
