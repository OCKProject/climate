<p class="p">Projected distribution models under the more optimistic scenario showed an increase of high quality habitat and a net loss of medium and low quality habitat, while the projections under the worst scenario indicate a generalized decrease in habitat suitability. Although no important loss of potential distribution areas are apparent, a large decrease of areas with high quality habitat may occur under the worst climate change scenario evaluated (
