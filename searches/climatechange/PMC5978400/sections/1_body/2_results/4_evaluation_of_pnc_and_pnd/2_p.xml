<p class="p">Background similarity test showed that 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> share climatic similarities with the mixed population (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). However, such similarity is not reciprocal when comparing the climatic requirements of the mixed population to those of the northern lineage—a possibility mentioned in 
 <xref rid="ref-69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Warren, Glor &amp; Turelli (2010)</xref>. A similar situation occurred when comparing projected niches under the worst climate change scenario (RCP8.5), where results suggested that 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic>´s niche will closely resemble the future climatic niche of the mixed population, in spite of not sharing any current similarity.
