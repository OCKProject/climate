<p class="p">Niche overlap and equivalence tests showed a large overlap between the contact population and 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> for niche models under current and worst scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). While limited niche overlap was reported, the overlap between the northern lineage and the mixed population increased under future climate change scenarios. On the other hand, the overlap between current and projected niches for 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> with the other groups was smaller, particularly with the northern lineage (
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic>). When using the results of this latter analysis as “empirical values” to perform identity and background similarity tests (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-3" class="xref">Tables 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-4" class="xref">4</xref>), we were able to show that statistical differences existed when comparing current niches and projected niches. This indicates that the climatic requirements between the lineages and mixed population are not equivalent.
