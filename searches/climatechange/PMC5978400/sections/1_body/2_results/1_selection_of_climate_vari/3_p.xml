<p class="p">All current distribution models generated for 
 <italic class="italic">L. guanicoe</italic> and its lineages, presented a good performance with mean AUC values over 0.89. The resulting geographic range for guanaco spanned for about a third of the Chilean continental surface. The geographic areas covered by 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. cacsilensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L.g. guanicoe</italic> were of 47,148 and 100,539 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively. The mixed population showed a geographic extent of 84,976 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Interestingly, our models had a 20% difference when comparing areas from the sum of lineages modeled independently and the total area modeled with all the lineages pooled as if they were a single lineage (232,664 vs. 284,499 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively). Full maps and predictions are available in supplemental information
