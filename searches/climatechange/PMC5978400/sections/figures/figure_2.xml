  <p class="p">Pink surface corresponds to areal loss and representing the areal fraction of the climatic niche that exists only in the current model. Olive surface corresponds to areal gains and represents the climatic niche area that exists only in the projected model. Orange surface corresponds to the area that has remained unchanged and represents the surface of the climatic niche that exists in both models (current and projected models). Panel (A) is the comparison between current and projected model under RCP2.6 to 2050; (B) the comparison between current and projected model under RCP2.6 to 2070; (C) the Comparison between current and projected model under RCP8.5 to 2050; (D) is the comparison between current and projected model under RCP8.5 to 2070.
