<p class="p">We found the past survival rate of 90.6% was likely sufficient to maintain a stable population (λ  ≥  1) for all but one scenario: a solar cycle similar to the modern grand maximum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). In this scenario, our model predicts annual survival would need to be increased to 91.0% (95% CI = 89.3%–93.4%; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). If the past population growth rate of 3.5% is to be maintained, then all scenarios with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> would require increasing annual survival above its long‐term mean (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). For example, during a typical solar cycle with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, our model predicts annual survival would need to be increased to 93.4% (95% CI = 91.8%–95.7%) to maintain 3.5% population growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>).
