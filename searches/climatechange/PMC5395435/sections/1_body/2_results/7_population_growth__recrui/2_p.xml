<p class="p">We used an 11‐year period for the typical sunspot cycle and estimated it as a sixth‐order polynomial of the number of years since a cycle began (model selected using AIC; min sunspot number = 10.8, max sunspot number = 156.6; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We used this typical cycle, the Dalton minimum cycle (1811–1821; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and the modern grand maximum cycle (1954–1964; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) to predict future whooping crane recruitment and population growth for two atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration scenarios (i.e., 400 and 500 ppm). Whooping crane population growth fluctuates inversely to the solar cycle, resulting in greater population growth during years of reduced solar activity (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). At the current atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (≈400 ppm), years with negative growth are likely rare during a typical solar cycle (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, our model predicts years with negative growth become more common in the future (500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), as 4 years of the typical solar cycle have negative population growth (i.e., λ  &lt;  1; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Average recruitment is predicted to fall below the long‐term average (0.137) in all the scenarios, except one: a solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum with 400 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Indeed, at 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> during a solar cycle similar to the modern grand maximum, mean recruitment lies below the amount required for population growth (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
