<p class="p">Only one scenario, a solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum with 400 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, results in population growth commensurate with the long‐term average (i.e., &gt;3.5% growth; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This scenario results in no simulations indicating a population decline. All other scenarios portend a future with whooping crane population growth likely falling below the long‐term average (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Population growth will likely be reduced by half during a solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, suggesting downlisting and recovery may take two times longer. The most likely future scenario, a typical solar cycle with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, suggests population growth will likely be minimal (0.4% mean growth which is an eighth of the long‐term average), with 31% of the simulations indicating a population decline. These results suggest downlisting and recovery may require eight times longer than conditions without climate change (Butler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). If the scenario of a solar cycle similar to the grand maximum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration occurs, then 63% of the simulations indicate population declines, likely precluding downlisting and recovery in the foreseeable future.
