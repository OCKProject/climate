<p class="p">Elevated concentrations of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> warm the Earth, reducing the proportion of days below freezing on the breeding grounds (i.e., increased temperature; Lemmen, Warren, Lacroix, &amp; Bush, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and increasing precipitation on the northern U.S. Great Plains during autumn (Melillo, Richmond, &amp; Yohe,
