<p class="p">Our model predicts recruitment declines as the magnitude of the solar cycle moves from the Dalton minimum to the modern grand maximum, or as atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations increase from 400 to 500 ppm (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The influence of sunspots and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on recruitment is comparable, although sunspots have a greater effect. For example, at 400 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, the difference in average population growth between the Dalton minimum (3.7% mean growth; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and the modern grand maximum (1.2% mean growth; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) is 2.5% (95% CI mean difference = 1.3%–3.8%). Hence, a solar cycle similar to the grand maximum would result in ≈68% less population growth than a solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum. Alternatively, during a typical solar cycle, the difference in average population growth between 400 ppm (2.2% mean growth; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) and 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (0.4% mean growth; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) is 1.8% (95% CI mean difference = 0.3%–3.6%). Hence, as atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration increases to 500 ppm, population growth will likely be reduced by ≈80% compared to the current CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration.
