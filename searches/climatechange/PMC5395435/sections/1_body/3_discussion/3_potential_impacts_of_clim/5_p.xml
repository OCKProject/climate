<p class="p">The sunspot numbers that compose the scenarios described above were observed within the data used (min = 4.2, max = 225.1) to build our models, with the exception of the minimum sunspot number observed during the Dalton minimum (2.3) and the two maximum sunspot numbers observed during the modern grand maximum (261.7 and 269.3). Although the 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is beyond the range of the data upon which our models were built, the relationships we developed between weather variables (DX32.WBNP.1103, ZNDX.NEDA.1011) and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration assumed a log‐linear relationship which results in conservative estimates of the potential magnitude of change. Further, the predictions at 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and the modern grand maximum for these weather variables were within the range of values observed for the variables historically (see results). Hence, our predictions about potential impacts of climate change on recruitment and population growth are tempered and reasonable.
