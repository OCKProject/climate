<p class="p">Recruitment should remain at or above 0.103 to maintain stable to increasing population growth (λ ≥ 1; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). If the scenario of a solar cycle similar to the grand maximum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> occurs, recruitment may decline to 0.099 (95% CI = 0.071–0.120; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and management intervention on the breeding grounds would likely have to result, on average, in an additional 0.5 juveniles per 100 adults to avoid population decline. To maintain long‐term average population growth (3.5%), recruitment should remain at or above 0.137 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The only scenario predicted to achieve this is 400 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration during a solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Other scenarios, such as a typical solar cycle or modern grand maximum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration suggests average recruitment may decline to 0.108 (95% CI = 0.081–0.128) and 0.099 (95% CI = 0.071–0.120; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), respectively. Thus, any management intervention on the breeding grounds would likely have to result, on average, in an additional 3 to 4 juveniles recruited per 100 adults to maintain the long‐term population growth.
