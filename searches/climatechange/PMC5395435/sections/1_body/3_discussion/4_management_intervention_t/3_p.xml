<p class="p">These targets appear achievable. Potential management strategies include predator management (Littlefield,

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), these challenges would need to be overcome to recover whooping cranes. Without management intervention, the required amount of time to achieve population goals for downlisting and recovery likely becomes greatly extended or potentially impossible, given our model's predictions.
