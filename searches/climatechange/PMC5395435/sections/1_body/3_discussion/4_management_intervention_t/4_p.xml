<p class="p">How climate change may manifest in the predator–prey cycle remains unclear. Lynx declines have been linked to climate warming (Yan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), yet we do not know the ecological ramifications of this outcome, or climate effects on other predators. Other complex interactions associated with ponds drying and increased vulnerability to nest and fledgling predation could also decrease recruitment even if predator densities remained similar or declined. Furthermore, increased temperatures may result in predator populations becoming less cyclic and more generalized in prey selection (Scott &amp; Craine,
