<p class="p">On the breeding grounds, recruitment increased with more days remaining below freezing during winter. We also observed that nesting pond depth decreased as the number of days remaining below freezing during winter decreased. The potential mechanism behind the association between recruitment and the number of freezing days during winter may be that fewer cold days (&lt;0°C) reduces the amount of time the active groundwater layer remains frozen. Frozen earth retains pond water into the nesting period, with thinner layers more easily breached by the water trapped above (Yoshikawa &amp; Hinzman, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Thawing of the ground allows water to permeate the soil, resulting in reduced pond depth, size, and longevity. Presumably, adult whooping cranes nest within ponds to reduce predation on themselves, eggs and hatchlings (Kuyt et al.,

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). If ponds dry too quickly, nests may become more vulnerable to terrestrial predators, thereby lowering hatchling survival resulting in reduced recruitment.
