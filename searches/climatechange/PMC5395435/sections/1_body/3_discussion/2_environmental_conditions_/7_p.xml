<p class="p">Variables associated with recruitment primarily operate on the breeding grounds or during southern migration across the northern U.S. Great Plains. The variables operating in other locations were much less influential. For example, precipitation on the wintering grounds prior to spring migration and breeding was associated with increased recruitment. This suggests that whooping cranes do not exhibit a complete income breeding strategy (Stephens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Instead, breeding propensity or other reproductive parameters appear partially controlled by conditions prior to migration. However, precipitation on the wintering grounds was at least 69% less influential than the other weather variables already discussed (Table
