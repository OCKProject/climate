<p class="p">The amount of precipitation in the northern U.S. Great Plains during the autumn migration was the second most important predictor. This variable had ≥36% the influence of the remaining weather variables. Recruitment declined as the amount of precipitation increased during autumn migration. We hypothesize that juveniles are more vulnerable to mortality or abandonment during inclement weather. As juveniles have greater energy expenditure during migration than adults (Rotics et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and are inexperienced foragers, inclement weather may reduce foraging opportunities (Clark, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0100" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), predisposing juveniles to greater morality risk. Further, inclement weather conditions can increase risk of collision for migrating birds with power lines or other infrastructure (Marques, Batalha, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and juvenile cranes are more vulnerable to collisions than adults (Brown &amp; Drewien,
