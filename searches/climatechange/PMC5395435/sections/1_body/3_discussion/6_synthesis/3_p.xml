<p class="p">Recruitment affects whooping crane population growth most (Butler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), and our model predictions show that climate change may imperil it. Hence, any perceptions that whooping cranes remain secure in Canada, and can remain free of active management, are false. If conserving whooping cranes in North America remains an important goal, then attention must center on understanding mechanisms limiting recruitment. There appears to be a connection between recruitment, breeding pond hydrology, and predation. Already, the numbers of boreal ponds and their temporal longevity during summer are declining (Carroll et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Smith et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Unless trends of increasing atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are abated, science must determine how to mitigate the likely reduction in recruitment by 2050. Future monitoring and research should focus on relationships of depth and seasonal longevity of nesting ponds with nest success and causes of nest failure. Additionally, fledgling mortality and its causes on the breeding grounds and during southern migration should be investigated. The results of this work could steer conservation actions toward long‐term sustainability and protection of whooping cranes in North America. If such efforts prove unsuccessful, then the only wild population of this species must adapt or likely face extinction.
