<p class="p">This whooping crane population will likely continue experiencing periodic and predictable years of low recruitment and growth, as sunspots form the primary driver of their approximate decadal population cycle. Climate change likely threatens this population by 2050 when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are expected to reach 500 ppm, as our model predicts population growth can become negative during any solar cycle (unlike 400 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Hence, science has roughly three decades to reveal the on‐the‐ground mechanisms relating solar activity and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> with recruitment (i.e., proximate causes) and to design approaches for mitigating the adverse effects. Alternatively, other management actions could increase annual survival to avoid population declines. Optimistically, increasing recruitment and survival so the population continues growing requires only 1–4 additional recruits or survivors per year. Survivorship is the tougher to address, as many of the actions are continental in scope and multifaceted (e.g., power line marking, wind turbine curtailment, hunter education and law enforcement, etc.).
