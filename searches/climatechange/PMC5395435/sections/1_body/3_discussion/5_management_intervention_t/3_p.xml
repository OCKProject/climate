<p class="p">Long‐term annual adult survival is 90.6% and likely remains sufficient to maintain population stability (0% growth) across all solar cycle and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration scenarios except during a solar cycle similar to the grand maximum with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Given this scenario, annual survival needs to reach 91.0% (95% CI = 89.3%–93.4%; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) to avoid a population decline. In a scenario where a typical solar cycle occurs with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, annual adult survival could decline to 90.2% (95% CI = 88.7%–92.5%; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) and still avoid population decline. Hence, given a typical solar cycle with 500 ppm CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and the current population of ≈340 whooping cranes, on average, 1 to 2 additional mortalities per year could result in a declining population.
