<p class="p">If management intervention cannot improve recruitment, maintaining long‐term average population growth (3.5%) likely requires increases in annual adult survival in all but one of the scenarios (solar cycle similar to the Dalton minimum with 400 ppm CO

 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>) to maintain the long‐term average population growth. At the current population of ≈340 whooping cranes, this is equivalent to, on average, 9 to 10 fewer adult mortalities per year. However, none of the variables we examined were important to predicting survival and many management actions are already underway to reduce adult mortality (e.g., signage to inform hunters, marking of power lines in strategic locations). Past mortality from power line collisions and incidental or illegal harvest is rare (&lt;1 bird/year succumbs to these mortality causes; Stehn &amp; Haralson‐Strobel,
