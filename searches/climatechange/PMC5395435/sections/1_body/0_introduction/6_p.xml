<p class="p">Other factors outside of the breeding grounds may also affect whooping crane recruitment as it represents a combination of several demographic parameters (e.g., breeding propensity, clutch size, hatch and fledge rates, and juvenile survival during migration). Reproduction by adults can be supported using stored resources (known as capital breeding) or via the uptake of resources concomitant to a reproductive attempt (known as income breeding; Stephens, Boyd, McNamara, &amp; Houston, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). If a capital breeding strategy is employed by whooping cranes, weather conditions prior to their departure to the breeding grounds may affect breeding propensity and nest success. Alternatively, juveniles may be influenced by conditions encountered during southern migration (e.g., inclement weather, food quality, and quantity) that could reduce their survival and subsequently affect their recruitment into the winter flock.
