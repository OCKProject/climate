<p class="p">We predicted the potential impact of climate change on whooping crane recruitment and population growth for future scenarios, by linking the primary drivers of recruitment with atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The solar cycle scenarios were the modern grand maximum (1954–1964), the Dalton minimum (1811–1821), and a typical cycle. This procedure reveals how climate change may affect the whooping crane population's dynamics through 2050, provides expectations for species recovery, and indicates where management intervention would likely be most effective.
