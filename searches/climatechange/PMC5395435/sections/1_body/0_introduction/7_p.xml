<p class="p">We examined environmental drivers of whooping crane recruitment by modeling it as a function of solar, weather, and hydrological factors spanning all portions of its life cycle (breeding, wintering, and migration). On the breeding grounds, these models examined associations of recruitment with the solar cycle and winter temperature and precipitation. For the wintering grounds, models included drought conditions and freshwater balance of estuaries, as these factors may limit food production (Butler etÂ al.,

During the spring and fall migrations, models evaluated temperature, precipitation and drought, as each affects food availability and production, and inclement weather may increase juvenile mortality during southern migration (Kuyt,
