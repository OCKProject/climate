<p class="p">Our aims were to model associations between whooping crane recruitment and environmental conditions, examine how climate change affects those conditions, and translate those effects to population growth. Our work reveals the climatic threats on the species and where they operate, it predicts the prospects for species recovery, and helps develop hypotheses about how climate drivers act on whooping crane demographics and where management intervention would be most effective. We demonstrate that although the wild whooping crane population is growing and therefore may appear secure (Butler, Harris, &amp; Strobel,
