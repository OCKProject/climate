<p class="p">To characterize the uncertainty in predicted recruitment and population growth rate for the climate change scenarios, we implemented a nonparametric bootstrap procedure. Specifically, for each iteration of the repeated cross‐validated LASSO procedure, we bootstrapped the models for each of the important weather variables and predicted the weather condition for each scenario. We bootstrapped whooping crane annual survival for each iteration of the repeated cross‐validated LASSO procedure so predicted population growth would incorporate uncertainty and variability in survival and predicted recruitment.</p>
