As surface water conditions in boreal ponds are affected by winter temperature and snow depth (Yoshikawa &amp; Hinzman, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), we examined these relationships on the whooping crane's breeding grounds. We used simple linear regression to relate mean pond depth to sunspot number and the proportion of freezing days and precipitation on the breeding grounds during November–March. We also used logistic regression to examine the relationship between recruitment and pond water depth. This analysis helped explain associations between some of the weather variables and recruitment.
