<p class="p">We suspected recruitment estimates may have been biased high during years with fewer surveys (similar biases occurred with winter mortality estimates; Butler etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We examined recruitment estimates for this potential bias by regressing recruitment and the number of surveys conducted during a winter between December 1 and March 31 (logistic regression). If unbiased, recruitment estimates should not be associated with the number of surveys. However, if an inverse relationship between recruitment and the number surveys exists, it indicates some adults are missed when the number of surveys is small. For example, detection of a whooping crane group was estimated as 55.8% (Strobel &amp; Butler, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) which means the cumulative detection probably does not exceed 99% until six surveys are completed. Therefore, estimates of recruitment are likely biased high during years in which the number of surveys conducted was less than six. We removed those potentially biased years and reexamined the association between recruitment and the number of surveys conducted.
