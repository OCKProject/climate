<p class="p">As indicators of weather conditions on the wintering grounds, we obtained monthly values of the Palmer drought indices for Texas Climatological Division 7 (Figure

We obtained monthly freshwater balance (i.e., balance = inflow − evaporation + precipitation) for the Guadalupe and Mission‐Aransas estuaries (Guthrie &amp; Lu,

The Aransas‐Wood Buffalo whooping crane population overwinters along both estuaries, so we also combined freshwater balance for them. As environmental conditions on the wintering grounds may affect whooping crane body condition and therefore reproduction once birds return to the breeding grounds (i.e., capital breeding; Stephens et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), we lagged the wintering ground variables by 1 year (e.g., drought indices from November 1950–March 1951 were paired with recruitment during winter 1951–1952).
