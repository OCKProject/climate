<p class="p">We divided the migratory route into two primary areas: northern U.S. Great Plains and southern Saskatchewan prairies. We obtained monthly values for the Palmer drought indices for Nebraska Climatological Divisions 2–9, South Dakota Climatological Divisions 2–3 and 6–9, and North Dakota Climatological Divisions 1–2, 4–5, and 8–9 (Figure

For each of the Palmer indices, we averaged data from the Climatological Divisions across months for the spring migration period (i.e., April) and autumn migration period (i.e., October–November).
