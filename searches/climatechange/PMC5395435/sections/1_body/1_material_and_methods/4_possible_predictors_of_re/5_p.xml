<p class="p">Few long‐term GHCN stations exist in the vicinity of Wood Buffalo National Park and the whooping crane's breeding grounds. We obtained weather data (same measures used for southern Saskatchewan prairies) from the GHCN station at Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, Canada (CA002202200), the station closest to the breeding grounds (Figure

For the breeding grounds, we also considered two periods as potentially important to recruitment: winter (November–March) and breeding (April–September). We considered the winter prior to arrival because surface water conditions in breeding ponds may be affected by winter weather (Yoshikawa &amp; Hinzman,
