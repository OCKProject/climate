<p class="p">We used the proportion of days in which the maximum temperature remained below freezing (i.e., ≤0°C), the proportion of days in which minimum temperature was below freezing, mean temperature, and the total precipitation obtained from three Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) stations (i.e., Regina University, CA004016640; Saskatoon Airport, CA004057120; and Muenster, CA004015440) located across the southern Saskatchewan prairies (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32892-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). All three of these stations had a complete record from 1950–2010 and covered the southern and northern portions of the migratory route through the southern Saskatchewan prairies. Data were pooled across the three stations and months for the spring (i.e., April) and autumn migration periods (i.e., September–October).
