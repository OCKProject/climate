<p class="p">We modeled recruitment (i.e., proportion of juvenile whooping cranes in the total population count for each winter) as a function of the predictor variables described above (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32892-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), many of which were collinear, using logistic regression. To select the model, we used the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), a statistical regularization technique (i.e., procedure for balancing model fit and complexity) appropriate for model selection when a relatively large set of possibly collinear predictor variables are used (Gerber, Kendall, Hooten, Dubovsky, &amp; Drewin,

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). Unlike other statistical regularization techniques (i.e., ridge regression), LASSO regression allows some effects to be exactly zero which results in a more easily interpretable model, because the number of predictors is reduced (Reineking &amp; Schröder,

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>). In LASSO regression, the balance between model fit and complexity is achieved through the parameter lambda.
