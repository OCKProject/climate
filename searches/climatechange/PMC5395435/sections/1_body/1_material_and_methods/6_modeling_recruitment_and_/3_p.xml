 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) to conduct the analysis. We used the cv.glmnet function to preform tenfold cross‐validation to select the optimal lambda (i.e., most regularized model whereby the mean cross‐validated error is within one standard error of the minimum; Hastie &amp; Qian, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). As the folds used in cross‐validation are selected randomly, we repeated the cross‐validation procedure 1,000 times to characterize the uncertainty in lambda and the model coefficients. We also calculated the proportion of repeats in which a predictor variable was selected.
