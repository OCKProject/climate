<p class="p">Whooping cranes begin arriving on their breeding grounds by late April, and their nests are initiated by mid‐May (Kuyt, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Whooping cranes build their nests in shallow boreal ponds or lakes by constructing a mound of mud and vegetation in open water or placing it among clumps of brush on natural islets (Kuyt,

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Whooping cranes, along with the young of the year, depart the breeding grounds starting in mid‐September and follow the same migratory route south to the Texas coast (Figure

 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>). During the autumn migration, central Saskatchewan appears to be a staging area in which whooping cranes congregate and forage on waste grain during late September to mid‐October (Johns, Woodsworth, &amp; Driver, 
 <xref rid="ece32892-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). Once whooping cranes depart the staging grounds in central Saskatchewan, southern migration across the USA can be as short as 1 week with delays occurring due to low‐pressure weather systems (Kuyt,
