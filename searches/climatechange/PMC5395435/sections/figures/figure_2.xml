  <p class="p">The solar cycle as indicated by sunspot number has varied over the last three centuries (1712–2007). The Dalton minimum occurred during 1811–1821 and modern grand maximum occurred during 1954–1964. We estimated the typical cycle as a sixth‐order polynomial of the number of years since a cycle began</p>
