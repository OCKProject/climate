  <title class="title">Parameter ranges for which each technology has the highest relative net present value.</title>
  <p class="p">The 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axes are in units of standardized values for each parameter—that is, population mean of that parameter (in each scenario) is at zero, and height is measured in s.d.’s from the mean. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Relate to mitigation scenario MS430–480 (that is, atmospheric CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in 2100 is 430–480 p.p.m. (IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6), consistent with a likely chance to keep temperature change below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels), and 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>–
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> relate to MS650–720 (RCP 4.5, in which temperature change below 3 °C is more unlikely than likely). Each panel is divided in two with three response variables (relative present values of BES, BEBCS or BECCS) on the left of the solid line, and the 12 most important independent parameters on the right. Each parameter has three bars (blue, pink and yellow) for parameter ranges in the years 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively. Bars show the mean +/− 1 s.d. of the samples in which BES (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>), BEBCS (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) or BECCS (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) has the highest RPV. Thus, the graph shows for each scenario (level of mitigation and year) how far each parameter must differ from the mean of that parameter in order to make each technology option the preferred one. Note that absent bars for BECCS in 2020 (
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) and BES in 2100 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) indicate that they are not economically viable at those times.
