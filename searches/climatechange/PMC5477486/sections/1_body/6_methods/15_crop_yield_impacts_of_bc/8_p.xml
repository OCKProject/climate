<p class="p">Of the BC yield-impact data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>, 85% were measured in the first year following BC addition, 10% in the second year, 3% in the third year, 2% in the fourth year and no data were available from longer term trials. Random forest analysis was conducted using the cForest function in the party package of the R statistical programming language, which provides random forest, bootstrapping and bagging ensemble algorithms utilizing conditional inference trees. cForest was run with an ensemble of 5,001 trees (parameter value ntree=5,001), 5 parameter tries per node (mtry=5), and the cforest_unbiased method to eliminate bias towards predictors with continuous values or greater number of categories. The resulting relative importance of the predictor variables (estimated by incremental change in mean square error from omitting a variable from the model) is shown in
