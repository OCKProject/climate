<p class="p">To estimate the relative importance of these different types of mechanisms, we conducted a random forest decision-tree analysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref> of a comprehensive database crop trials with 781 treatments involving lignocellulosic feedstocks (excluding manures) from 68 published studies (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 3</xref>). The analysis was constrained to include only non-manure lignocellulosic feedstocks, because we are interested here in feedstocks that may have a competitive use in bioenergy power generation. Studies using hydrochar were also excluded because hydrochar turns over rapidly (thus having little sequestration potential), and its production is not currently compatible with power co-generation. Previous meta-analyses of published yield responses have not employed methods that account for both correlation (non-independence) and interactive effects of explanatory parameters

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. The random forest approach does not have these limitations, and furthermore makes no implicit assumptions about the linearity or form of the model. The stochastic ensemble approach of random forests also eliminates the tendency of single decision tree models to overfit data
