<p class="p">The relative importance of the model parameters was estimated by the IMSE for each parameter in the random forest analysis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Soil pH and CEC were overwhelmingly, and approximately equally, the most important predictors of yield response to BC (IMSE=0.085 and 0.084, respectively). Next, clay and silt content, BC carbon fraction, and fertilizer and BC application rates were of secondary importance (IMSE=0.02â€“0.04). Crop type, pyrolysis temperature, sand, SOC, BC pH and feedstock were only minor predictors of yield response (IMSE&lt;0.02). Time since BC application was found to be a very poor indicator of yield response within the available data, but this is likely to have been skewed by most of the measurements being taken during the first cropping cycle following application.
