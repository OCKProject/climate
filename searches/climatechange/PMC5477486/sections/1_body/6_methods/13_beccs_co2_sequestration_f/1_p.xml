<p class="p">We assume that between 81â€“91 % of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> generated from biomass combustion is sequestered
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. Note that, per unit electricity generated, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> captured is greater than CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> avoided, because the efficiency penalty (see BECCS efficiency penalty, above) means that more CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is emitted per GJ electricity. Care must be taken when comparing literature values as to whether they refer to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> captured or avoided. Here we base calculations on CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> captured per unit biomass combusted.
