<p class="p">Because pH impacts of BC are approximately equally responsible for observed yield responses as are CEC effects (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), it is unlikely that the more extreme yield responses observed would be solely attributable to increased SOC, rather than having also a pH and possibly nutrient mechanism contributing. We, therefore, estimate that the potential range of persistent yield impacts attributable to BC increasing SOC (and the associated effects on CEC and WHC) lies within the 50% of the yield-response data represented by the interquartile range (
