 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 9</xref>, for both recent (2012) plant, and for projections to 2030. It was assumed that there would be no significant further cost reductions or efficiency improvements beyond the 2030 values. Values in 2020 were estimated by linear interpolation. To provide comparability with BECCS, which is typically only considered plausible at the large scale, the parameter ranges for &gt;50â€‰MW plant were used in the Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis.
