<p class="p">There has been much debate in the recent literature about the appropriate discount rate to apply for issues with long-term and intergenerational impacts such as climate change. Discounting of future costs and benefits is done for two principal reasons. First, if the overall economy grows, as is assumed in many (but not all) forecasts, the utility of a given sum of money diminishes according to the law of diminishing marginal utility. Second, and more contentiously, future costs and benefits are often discounted simply because they occur further in the future. This second component of discounting is referred to as the pure time discount rate (PTDR) and is a common feature of most markets. The Stern review
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref> challenged the prevailing application of a PTDR, arguing that it is indefensible with regard to inter-generational ethics. For example, Stern 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (page 31 of ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>) state, ‘we take a simple approach in this review: if a future generation will be present, we suppose that it has the same claim on our ethical attention as the current one’. This stance has been challenged by others who argue that applying a PTDR is more consistent with observed market behaviour
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>, and with increasing uncertainty associated with forecasting the distant future
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. We do not take a specific stance here on the correct social discount rate to apply, but use a sensitivity range in the Monte Carlo analysis that covers the range of values normally applied as social discount rates, from the lower value of 1.5% per year suggested by Stern 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>, to the upper bound of 6% suggested by both Nordhaus
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref> and Weitzman
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>.
