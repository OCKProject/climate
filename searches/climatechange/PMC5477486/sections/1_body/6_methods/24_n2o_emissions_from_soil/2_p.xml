<p class="p">Mechanisms and long-term dynamics of BC’s N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O impacts are still poorly understood and quantified. Some evidence suggests that N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O suppression could be short-lived, decaying over a few years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79" class="xref">79</xref>. We use a sensitivity range of 1–100 year for the time over which N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O suppression persists, with a logarithmic distribution to skew probability towards the lower end of this range.
