 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 5</xref> shows the production, yield and price of major food crops globally during the period 2008–2013, ranked by area harvested (derived from FAOStat data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>). The range of impacts of BC on yields of major crops is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref>. Note that major crops, such as sugar cane, that have shown either no significant yield improvements or only yield reductions with BC are not included, because it was assumed that BC would not be used for such crops. The economic values of these yield increments are then calculated by multiplying by the crop price. The interquartile range of these values for major crops with demonstrated yield responses to BC are shown in
