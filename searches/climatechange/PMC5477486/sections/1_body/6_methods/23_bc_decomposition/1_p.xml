<p class="p">Molar O:C ratio was used as a predictor variable of BC mineralization rate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" class="xref">76</xref>. Data relating O:C ratio to estimated half-life were taken from the metastudy by ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" class="xref">76</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). The regression of 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq20" class="xref">equation (20)</xref> thus yielded a value for the mineralization factor (

 <sub class="sub">d</sub>) of 4.89 +/âˆ’ 1.8 (1 s.d.). Mineralization rate in the Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis was, therefore, modelled using 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq20" class="xref">equation (20)</xref> with values of 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> populated from a Gaussian distribution with mean=4.89, and s.d.=1.8. O:C ratio was calculated according to 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq6" class="xref">equations (6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq8" class="xref">8)</xref> in the supporting information of ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. It was assumed that carbon credits would be applicable to BC carbon remaining after 100 years.
