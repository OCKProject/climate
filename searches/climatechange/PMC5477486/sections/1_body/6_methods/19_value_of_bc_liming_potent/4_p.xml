 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref> gives mean ash content of straw, wood and bagasse as 5.5+/− 5.3% (1 s.d.), and base elements make up 41 +/− 34% (1 s.d.) of the ash elements by mass. To calculate ash content of the BC, it was assumed that ash was conserved during pyrolysis. The low end of the sensitivity range for liming value was set at zero, to represent situations in which the soil has no pH constraints, or when combustion ash from a BES might be used to provide an equivalent liming value. It was assumed that BC would not be used in situations that cause adverse pH impacts (for example, adding high pH BC to already alkaline soils).
