 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Norway), and the highest was 56.32 USD GJ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (Italy). However, power generation in Norway is currently over 90% hydro-electricity and may, therefore, be unrepresentative of prices for biomass energy. The next lowest price was in the USA, at 17.88 USD GJ
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was therefore used as the lower bound of the range. In all, 2014 electricity prices were, accordingly, assumed to lay in the range 14.6–56.3 USD GJ
