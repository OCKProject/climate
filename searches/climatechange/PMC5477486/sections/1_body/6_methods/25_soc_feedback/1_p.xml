<p class="p">BC can promote mineralization (an interaction sometimes referred to as ‘positive priming’) of easily mineralizable non-pyrogenic soil organic carbon (npSOC), and can also promote stabilization of npSOC, potentially leading to increased npSOC stocks in the long term (negative priming)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Considerable uncertainty remains in the underlying mechanisms for both positive and negative priming, and in the sizes and longevity of these impacts under differing edaphic and environmental conditions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80" class="xref">80</xref>. Nonetheless, the ranges of published measurements of the magnitude of BC’s priming effect on npSOC turnover and stabilization can be used to modify rate constants in established SOC turnover models to estimate the possible range of priming impacts on long term npSOC stocks
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Applying this methodology to the RothC soil carbon model, while accounting also for impacts of BC on NPP, indicates that BC could potentially alter npSOC stocks over 100 years by up to −0.03 to +0.3 Mg npSOC per Mg BC C added. We adopt this method from Woolf and Lehmann
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>, applied over a 100 year time frame, to estimate the potential impact on npSOC within the sensitivity range of −0.03 to +0.3 mg npSOC per mg BC-C. The net magnitude of BEBCS sequestered carbon was then adjusted by adding the (positive or negative) npSOC feedback to the quantity of BC remaining in the soil. We note, however, that the value of any possible increase in npSOC may be challenging to internalize into carbon markets unless significant advances in understanding of the underlying mechanisms allow them to be predicted within tighter confidence limits.
