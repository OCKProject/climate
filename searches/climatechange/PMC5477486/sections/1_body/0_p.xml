<p class="p">A target rise in global mean temperature of less than 2 °C has been widely advocated as necessary to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Most mitigation scenarios that achieve this include widespread carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of the century to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is costly and to recover from an overshoot of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Therefore, CDR is critical to achieving climate stabilization within safe limits. Hopes for CDR have largely been pinned on the extensive deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is the only negative emissions technology included in the mitigation scenarios of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth Assessment Report
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. BECCS achieves a net removal of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere by relying on photosynthesis to fix CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and interrupting the natural carbon cycle that would otherwise have rapidly returned this carbon to the atmosphere during respiration or combustion. Instead, BECCS sequesters the photosynthetically fixed carbon as post-combustion CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> stored in a stable reservoir

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. However, BECCS may be costly and parts of the technology are unproven
