<p class="p">Two mitigation scenarios were investigated: MS430–480, in which atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration in 2100 is in the range 430–480 p.p.m. (IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6), consistent with a likely (defined as 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&gt;0.66) probability of temperature change below 2 °C relative to pre-industrial levels; and MS650–720, which relates to the upper band of IPCC RCP4.5, in which temperature change below 2 °C is unlikely, but&lt;3 °C warming remains more likely than not
