<p class="p">In 2020–2050, BES is the preferred technology option when its RPV is, on average, 0.8–1.2 s.d.’s higher than its mean value (that is, 
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>=0.8–1.2). For BES to achieve this higher than average RPV requires conditions that favour BES relative to BEBCS (the primary competing technology at the carbon prices prevailing in 2020–2050 even under the more stringent mitigation scenario MS430–480). The main factors that favour BES over BEBCS are: a lower than average BC yield impact (
 <italic class="italic">δ</italic>=−0.7 to −1.0 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), higher than average energy prices (+0.4 to +0.5 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), and low discount rates (−0.3 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>). By 2050 in MS430–480, lower than average carbon prices (−0.4 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) (as carbon prices start to move into a range where BECCS is optimal under favourable conditions) and above average carbon intensity of the electricity generation sector (+0.4 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) also begin to have a stronger role in determining if BES will be the preferred technology.
