<p class="p">In 2020–2050, BEBCS is optimal under roughly the opposite conditions that favour BES (BES and BEBCS being the main competing technologies at these times). In essence, this means that BEBCS is most likely to be favoured when the BC yield impact is higher than average (+0.4 to +0.6 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), energy prices are below average (−0.2 to −0.4 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), and discount rates are slightly below average (− 0.2 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>). By 2100 in MS650–720, more stringent conditions are required to keep BEBCS optimal, with a higher yield impact (+0.9 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), lower discount rate (−0.7 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), and lower electricity prices (−0.6 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>) being required. Whereas, in MS430–480, BEBCS remains competitive by 2100 with BECCS only under particularly favourable conditions that give BEBCS an RPV +2.0 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> higher than average. These conditions depend on a combination of a very low discount rate (−1.2 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), a carbon price that is in the lower range for that time (−0.7 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), and locations with soils that show a high BC yield impact (+1.1 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>), which is most likely to occur on cropland soils with low CEC (Methods: crop yields impact of BC).
