<p class="p">Plotting the RPVs and the highest-ranked parameters on a parallel coordinates plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) provides a useful visual indication of the typical conditions in which the RPV of each technology is maximized. Each line on the parallel coordinates plot corresponds to a single point in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with lines connecting the values for each parameter on their respective (parallel) axes. Each parallel parameter axis is normalized to range from the minimum to the maximum value of that parameter. For example, it can be seen that a high RPV for BECCS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, orange lines) correlates with high carbon and electricity prices (evident in the clustering of orange lines at the upper end on these parameter axes), whereas the opposite conditions favour BEBCS. When interpreting such plots, however, care must be taken to consider covariance between parameters, which can give rise to correlations that are not causal. For example, it can be seen in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref> that large increases in crop price correlate with a high RPV for BECCS, despite the fact that high crop prices would favour BEBCS rather than BECCS if all else remained equal. But, the time factor in the model means that crop prices rise over time (Methods: future food price trends), while other factors that improve the competitiveness of BECCS also increase with time and thus co-vary with crop prices without any causal link.
