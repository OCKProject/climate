Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario.

Most mitigation scenarios that achieve this include widespread carbon dioxide removal (CDR) in the second half of the century to compensate for residual emissions from sectors where mitigation is costly and to recover from an overshoot of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. Therefore, CDR is critical to achieving climate stabilization within safe limits. Hopes for CDR have largely been pinned on the extensive deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), which is the only negative emissions technology included in the mitigation scenarios of the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fifth Assessment Report<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. BECCS achieves a net removal of CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere by relying on photosynthesis to fix CO<sub>2</sub> and interrupting the natural carbon cycle that would otherwise have rapidly returned this carbon to the atmosphere during respiration or combustion. Instead, BECCS sequesters the photosynthetically fixed carbon as post-combustion CO<sub>2</sub> stored in a stable reservoir<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. However, BECCS may be costly and parts of the technology are unproven<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>.</p><p>An alternative CDR approach is biochar (BC), in which biomass is pyrolysed and the carbon-rich residue sequestered in soil. BC, like BECCS, relies on photosynthesis to fix CO<sub>2</sub>, followed by storage of this fixed carbon in a stable reservoir (in this case, soil). As a co-benefit, BC can improve the fertility of degraded or less fertile soils<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.

Each of these technologies has advantages and disadvantages. BES generates the greatest bioenergy per unit biomass. BECCS sequesters the largest fraction of biomass carbon, but generates less energy than BES at a higher cost<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.

These BEBCS co-benefits potentially offset some of the cost of its CDR, and simultaneously address issues of food security for a growing world population<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. BC can also increase or decrease the turnover rate of native soil organic carbon (SOC)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>, which would create a negative or positive feedback, respectively, on the amount of carbon sequestered. BEBCS also has additional costs associated with haulage, handling and tillage of BC.</p><p>Under which, if any, set of biophysical and economic conditions BEBCS becomes more attractive relative to both BES and BECCS has not been previously investigated. We address this issue here by developing a multi-parameter model to determine which of BES, BECCS, or BEBCS is the more economically efficient use of a given biomass resource for climate-change mitigation under varying conditions. A multivariate Monte Carlo analysis was conducted using a broad range of parameter related to agro-ecological, economic, technological, global spatial and temporal variability and uncertainty to 2100. Here we show that, despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices. Our model predicts that, at carbon prices above $1,000&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BECCS is typically the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation. At carbon prices below $1,000&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where BC significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure BES being otherwise preferred. Thus, we have shown that BEBCS can be competitive with both BES and BECCS under a range of conditions.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Impact of carbon price on optimal technology</title><p>Biomass supply chains are highly heterogeneous, with costs and emissions varying geospatially and temporally with species, production conditions, and harvest, collection and storage practices. To facilitate comparison of biomass conversion technologies across this diverse landscape of feedstock supply chains, the analysis was based on a functional unit of mass of biomass delivered to the conversion facility gate, assuming that all costs and emissions associated with delivering that biomass are independent of the conversion technology used to process it. For each of the conversion technologies (BES, BECCS or BEBCS), we define its relative net present value (RPV) as the difference between its net present value (NPV) and the NPV of the best alternative. By making comparisons on the basis of RPV per unit biomass, all costs, benefits and emissions associated with biomass supply cancel out. For a given biomass supply chain, we thus calculate which of the technologies is most economically efficient relative to the alternatives under given conditions, with the caveat that this approach does not determine when biomass price or environmental externalities would make none of the bioenergy conversion processes viable. A full description of the calculation of RPV is provided in Methods.</p><p>At carbon prices below $460&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BES has the highest mean NPV (range where BES mean RPV&#x0003e;0 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). For carbon prices in the range of $460&#x02013;$900&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BEBCS has the highest mean NPV. Above $900&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BECCS has the highest mean NPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>).</p><p>Although these three technologies can be broadly categorized by which is optimal at different carbon prices, variability (and, to a lesser extent, uncertainty) in their RPVs contributes to considerable overlap in the ranges of suitability of the three technologies (see overlapping uncertainty ranges shown by the shaded areas at +/&#x02212; 1 s.d. (<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>). In the lower carbon-price range below $400&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C, BES is most likely (<italic>P</italic>=0.44&#x02013;0.64) to have the highest NPV, while BEBCS has the highest NPV for most other situations (<italic>P</italic>=0.37&#x02013;0.44), BECCS being infrequently (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.1) the most economic biomass power generation technology in this carbon-price range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although BECCS is typically the technology with highest NPV in the higher carbon-price range (&#x0003e;$1,000&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C), even with carbon prices as high as $3,000&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C BEBCs remains the most economic technology in 20% of the parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>).</p><p>Two mitigation scenarios were investigated: MS430&#x02013;480, in which atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> concentration in 2100 is in the range 430&#x02013;480&#x02009;p.p.m. (IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway RCP2.6), consistent with a likely (defined as <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.66) probability of temperature change below 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C relative to pre-industrial levels; and MS650&#x02013;720, which relates to the upper band of IPCC RCP4.5, in which temperature change below 2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C is unlikely, but&#x0003c;3&#x02009;&#x000b0;C warming remains more likely than not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.5). The carbon price ranges for each of the mitigation scenarios (MS430&#x02013;480 and MS650&#x02013;720) in each of the years 2020, 2050 and 2100 are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> to facilitate cross referencing of the carbon prices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a,b</xref> to the scenarios (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> for cumulative probability distributions of carbon prices in each scenario, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref> for summary statistics of these distributions).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Relative importance of parameters</title><p>The relative importance of parameters in determining variability in RPV was assessed by random forest analysis, a method that takes account of parameter covariances<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. Parameter importance was estimated by incremental mean square error (IMSE) of the random forest model with respect to each parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The highest ranked parameters, in order of their importance as determinants of BEBCS RPV are electricity price, BC&#x02019;s long-term impact on crop yields, carbon price and discount rate. Electricity price and BC&#x02019;s crop-yield impact are of approximately equal importance because the value of BC to crop production must offset the foregone energy production involved in its manufacture for BEBCS to be preferred. Note that it is the long-term impact of BC on alleviating soil constraints to crop yields that is critical to its economic value. BC is most likely to have a long-term positive impact on crop production in soils with low cation exchange capacity (CEC) (Methods: crop yield impacts of BC). While BC can also improve crop yields through ephemeral mechanisms such as fertilization (when BC contains plant-available nutrients) or raising the pH of acidic soils, these mechanisms have lower economic value, because their impact diminishes rapidly over time (Methods: value of BC&#x02019;s liming potential to address soil pH constraints&#x0201d;, and &#x0201c;value of BC&#x02019;s nutrient content). The next most important determinant of BEBCS RPV was the persistence or stability of BC in soil (Methods: BC decomposition, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>The ranking order of most important parameters differed slightly for BES and BECCS, in which cases carbon price ranked highest. Carbon price is more important for BES and BECCS, because it is the primary factor in determining which of these two is more cost effective, with low (high) carbon prices favouring BES (BECCS), with other factors altering the balance between them in the intermediate price range. BEBCS, on the other hand, is slightly less sensitive to carbon price than BES or BECCS, because it has an additional major value stream&#x02014;its crop yield impact&#x02014;that is independent of carbon pricing. Discount rate ranks highly because of its differential impact on the various technologies, with BC continuing to accrue benefits gradually over time after it has been produced (due to its impacts on soil fertility and soil GHG emissions), whereas the revenue streams from BES and BECCS (energy production and carbon sequestration) are valued at time of production.</p><p>Plotting the RPVs and the highest-ranked parameters on a parallel coordinates plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>) provides a useful visual indication of the typical conditions in which the RPV of each technology is maximized. Each line on the parallel coordinates plot corresponds to a single point in the multi-dimensional parameter space, with lines connecting the values for each parameter on their respective (parallel) axes. Each parallel parameter axis is normalized to range from the minimum to the maximum value of that parameter. For example, it can be seen that a high RPV for BECCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>, orange lines) correlates with high carbon and electricity prices (evident in the clustering of orange lines at the upper end on these parameter axes), whereas the opposite conditions favour BEBCS. When interpreting such plots, however, care must be taken to consider covariance between parameters, which can give rise to correlations that are not causal. For example, it can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref> that large increases in crop price correlate with a high RPV for BECCS, despite the fact that high crop prices would favour BEBCS rather than BECCS if all else remained equal. But, the time factor in the model means that crop prices rise over time (Methods: future food price trends), while other factors that improve the competitiveness of BECCS also increase with time and thus co-vary with crop prices without any causal link.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Impacts of mitigation scenario and time on technology mix</title><p>A more detailed approach to quantifying and visualizing the impacts and interactions of parameters was investigated using the distributions of parameter values for which BES, BEBCS or BECCS becomes the preferred technology, disaggregated by mitigation scenario and time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref> indicates for each scenario (level of mitigation and year) how far each parameter must differ from the mean of that parameter in order to make each technology option the optimal one. In the following discussion, the bias, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>, of parameter <italic>P</italic> is defined as <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>=[<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>(<italic>P,T</italic>)&#x02212;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>(<italic>P</italic>)]/<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>(<italic>P</italic>), where <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>(<italic>P</italic>) and <italic>&#x003c3;</italic>(<italic>P</italic>) are the mean and s.d., respectively, of parameter <italic>P</italic>, and <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>(<italic>P,T</italic>) is the mean when technology <italic>T</italic>&#x02208;{BES, BEBCS, BECCS} has the highest RPV. That is, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> provides a measure (in dimensionless units of s.d.&#x02019;s) of how far, on average, values of <italic>P</italic> must deviate from the mean for a given technology to be most economic. A high value of <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> indicates that a parameter exerts a strong effect on whether a technology will be the preferred option, with positive (negative) values of <italic>&#x003b4;</italic> indicating that the parameter must be higher (lower) than average to make that technology optimal. Absolute values of the ranges, means and s.d.&#x02019;s of each parameter in each scenario are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 2&#x02013;4</xref>.</p><p>In 2020&#x02013;2050, BES is the preferred technology option when its RPV is, on average, 0.8&#x02013;1.2 s.d.&#x02019;s higher than its mean value (that is, <italic>&#x003b4;</italic>=0.8&#x02013;1.2). For BES to achieve this higher than average RPV requires conditions that favour BES relative to BEBCS (the primary competing technology at the carbon prices prevailing in 2020&#x02013;2050 even under the more stringent mitigation scenario MS430&#x02013;480). The main factors that favour BES over BEBCS are: a lower than average BC yield impact (<italic>&#x003b4;</italic>=&#x02212;0.7 to &#x02212;1.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), higher than average energy prices (+0.4 to +0.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and low discount rates (&#x02212;0.3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>). By 2050 in MS430&#x02013;480, lower than average carbon prices (&#x02212;0.4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) (as carbon prices start to move into a range where BECCS is optimal under favourable conditions) and above average carbon intensity of the electricity generation sector (+0.4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) also begin to have a stronger role in determining if BES will be the preferred technology.</p><p>By 2100, BES is not competitive in MS430&#x02013;480 under any conditions (note the absence of bars for BES in this scenario in 2100 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). In MS650&#x02013;720, on the other hand, BES maintains its competitiveness in 2100 only when a combination of factors are all seen, including a high carbon intensity (+1.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), low carbon prices (&#x02212;1.5&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), high cost of carbon capture and storage (+1.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and a low fraction of CO<sub>2</sub> being sequestered by BECCS (&#x02212;1.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>).</p><p>In 2020&#x02013;2050, BEBCS is optimal under roughly the opposite conditions that favour BES (BES and BEBCS being the main competing technologies at these times). In essence, this means that BEBCS is most likely to be favoured when the BC yield impact is higher than average (+0.4 to +0.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), energy prices are below average (&#x02212;0.2 to &#x02212;0.4&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and discount rates are slightly below average (&#x02212; 0.2&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>). By 2100 in MS650&#x02013;720, more stringent conditions are required to keep BEBCS optimal, with a higher yield impact (+0.9&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), lower discount rate (&#x02212;0.7&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and lower electricity prices (&#x02212;0.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) being required. Whereas, in MS430&#x02013;480, BEBCS remains competitive by 2100 with BECCS only under particularly favourable conditions that give BEBCS an RPV +2.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic> higher than average. These conditions depend on a combination of a very low discount rate (&#x02212;1.2&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), a carbon price that is in the lower range for that time (&#x02212;0.7&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and locations with soils that show a high BC yield impact (+1.1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), which is most likely to occur on cropland soils with low CEC (Methods: crop yields impact of BC).</p><p>BECCS is not competitive in 2020 in MS650&#x02013;720 under any conditions (hence, the bars for BECCS are absent for these years in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4f</xref>). In 2020, BECCS is only competitive in MS430&#x02013;480 under highly favourable conditions that require a very low cost for carbon dioxide capture and sequestration (CCS) (&#x02212;1.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), low BC yield impact (&#x02212;1.0&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and high carbon prices (+0.7&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>). For BECCS to be competitive in 2050 in the more ambitious mitigation scenario MS430&#x02013;480 requires that a combination of factors improve its performance relative to both BES and BEBCS simultaneously, both of which are also viable technologies under a wide range of conditions at that time. This requires some combination of low BC yield impact (&#x02212;0.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), high carbon price (+0.3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), low CCS cost (&#x02212;0.8&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>) and high discount rate (+0.3&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>). By 2100 in MS430&#x02013;480, BECCS is favoured under most conditions, therefore, no significant bias is observed in any of the parameters to make BECCS competitive. The same is broadly true in MS650&#x02013;720, except that BEBCS can remain competitive in 2100 when its yield impact is high (+0.9&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), the discount rate is low (&#x02212;0.7&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>), and electricity prices are low (&#x02212;0.6&#x02009;<italic>&#x003c3;</italic>).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results show that the availability and inclusion of BEBCS within a portfolio of climate-mitigation measures can reduce the costs and ease the implementation of long-term CDR strategies using biomass, because BEBCS can be significantly cheaper than BECCS when agronomic benefits offset costs. The reduced cost of CDR using BEBCS, relative to an energy supply portfolio in which BECCS is the only negative emissions technology, may allow for earlier CDR deployment at a lower carbon price than in scenarios without BEBCS.</p><p>However, long-term improvements in soil productivity from BC applications are required for BEBCS to become competitive with either BES or BECCS. This suggests that an integrated portfolio of BECCS plus BEBCS would maximize the economic potential for CDR, with BEBCS being preferred where long-term fertility of agricultural soils can benefit most from BC. However, it is important to note that long-term crop trials with BC remain largely absent from the published literature. Of the 781 treatments from 68 published studies used to develop the crop response relationship for our model, 85% were measured in the first year following BC addition, 10% in the second year, 3% in the third year, 2% in the fourth year and no data were available from longer term trials in the peer-reviewed literature (Methods: Crop yield impacts of BC, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figs 3&#x02013;5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Tables 5 and 6</xref>). Although a correlation between higher crop response and low soil CEC was found, suggesting that BC can offer long term improvement to the fertility of low CEC soils (Methods: Crop yield impacts of BC), the evidence to support this hypothesis from direct observation remains inadequate. Furthermore, in some studies, unfavourable changes in soil chemical, physical and biological properties and reductions in crop yields have been reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. An improved understanding of the mechanisms underlying crop response to BC will support the development of decision-support models that direct BC applications into systems they can most benefit, and that avoid the application of unsuitable grades of BC in cropping systems where they may do harm, while distinguishing between uncertainty and manageable variability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Nonetheless, we note that there is currently low confidence and high uncertainty in the expected long-term response of specific soil-crop systems to BC amendments. While the parameter ranges used in our model reflect this high level of uncertainty, it is clear that further research to provide long term data on crop response in a variety of soils, cropping systems and agroecological zones should be a pre-requisite to the widespread use of BC. Further research will also be required to quantify impacts on ecosystem services and functions such as interactions with soil-dwelling and aquatic biota, nutrient cycling through ecosystems and the potential for contamination or bioaccumulation of contaminants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>.</p><p>Where or when BEBCS is not viable, BES (BECCS) is more often than not (that is, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003e;0.5) the preferred option at carbon prices below (above) $660&#x02009;Mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> C. The dependence of BEBCS on beneficial soil-fertility impacts to be economically viable means that its economic potential for climate-change mitigation is likely lower than its sustainable technical potential previously reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. BEBCS may, however, increase the total technical potential for CDR, not just because it allows for earlier deployment, but also because it may be applicable in situations where BECCS is not: for example, in locations too remote from suitable geologic or other sinks for BECCS to be economic, or in the production of carbon-negative transport biofuels&#x02014;a sector not readily compatible with CO<sub>2</sub> capture and storage. The results reported here indicate that BEBCS could be a key component to reduce the costs and otherwise ease the implementation of long-term climate-mitigation strategies.</p><p>At present, integrated assessment models (IAMs) are the primary tool for assessing questions such as these associated with long-term stabilization scenarios. While recognizing that it is premature to embark on a large scale deployment of BEBCS for climate-change mitigation, given the remaining uncertainties outlined above, we recommend that a useful next phase of research would be inclusion of BEBCS as a technology option in IAMs. Large uncertainties are routinely investigated in IAMs by the use of scenarios as a means to provide what-if analyses. For example, the current uncertainty over the viability of CCS as a mitigation technology option, has been investigated in IAM simulations through the use of scenarios in which CCS either is or is not included as an option (see, for example, fig. 6.35 in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Including scenarios, both with and without BEBCS, in IAM simulations would allow for a more thorough understanding of how availability of BEBCS as a mitigation option would affect the cost, timing and technology mix of a comprehensive mitigation strategy, if increased crop yields persist in the long term. This improved understanding will be critical to making informed decisions about how great an investment in further BC research is justified. For example, we have shown that, with carbon prices expected to rise over time, BEBCS could lead to earlier adoption of CDR. However, the converse is also possible, that BEBCS might delay adoption of BECCS until carbon prices rise sufficiently high for BECCS to become competitive with BEBCS. The overall impact of such interactions on overall mitigation outcomes and costs can only be assessed adequately by using IAMs.</p><p>A final issue is the question of the costs and impacts of biomass supply chains to support any of these technologies at a sufficient scale to make a substantial contribution to climate change mitigation. The land area required to provide sufficient BECCS to meet the requirements of MS430&#x02013;480 has been estimated at 400&#x02013;700&#x02009;Mha (two to four times the global area of abandoned or marginal land)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

The results presented here are independent of the actual costs (economic, social and environmental) and prices of biomass supply, because we calculate only the relative value of each technology (that is, how much better or worse it is than the alternative technologies considered). In practice, these costs and the price of biomass will be key determinants of the feasibility of any mitigation strategy that places demands on biomass supply. At present, there is low agreement in the literature as to the scale of the biomass potential once economic, social and environmental impacts are considered. Improved estimates using a systems approach that considers all these aspects in a spatially explicit manner must be a high research priority to ensure that policy decisions with possibly irreversible global implications are not based on unrealistic estimates of the biomass supply potential.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Overall approach</title><p>A discounted cost-benefit analysis approach was used to compare BES, BECCS and BEBCS, with global environmental benefits of avoided carbon dioxide emissions internalized into the econometric model as a carbon price.

Discounting of future costs and benefits is done for two principal reasons. First, if the overall economy grows, as is assumed in many (but not all) forecasts, the utility of a given sum of money diminishes according to the law of diminishing marginal utility. Second, and more contentiously, future costs and benefits are often discounted simply because they occur further in the future. This second component of discounting is referred to as the pure time discount rate (PTDR) and is a common feature of most markets. The Stern review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> challenged the prevailing application of a PTDR, arguing that it is indefensible with regard to inter-generational ethics. For example, Stern <italic>et al</italic>. (page 31 of ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) state, &#x02018;we take a simple approach in this review: if a future generation will be present, we suppose that it has the same claim on our ethical attention as the current one&#x02019;. This stance has been challenged by others who argue that applying a PTDR is more consistent with observed market behaviour<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, and with increasing uncertainty associated with forecasting the distant future<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. We do not take a specific stance here on the correct social discount rate to apply, but use a sensitivity range in the Monte Carlo analysis that covers the range of values normally applied as social discount rates, from the lower value of 1.5% per year suggested by Stern <italic>et al</italic>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, to the upper bound of 6% suggested by both Nordhaus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> and Weitzman<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>.</p><p>It should be noted that BES is, in comparison to BECCS and BEBCS a more mature technology. Therefore, it is currently considered to be less risky to invest in this technology. Risk is sometimes reflected in discount rates, with higher (risk-adjusted) discount rates being applied to higher risk technologies. In this analysis we account for risk, not by applying differential discount rates to each technology, but by using a Monte Carlo method to simulate uncertainty in a technology performing worse (or better) than expected. Expected cash flows are thus adjusted in line with the probability distributions of expected returns. We have thus used the conventional practice of applying a common social discount rate to quantify the uncertainty in the net social costs and benefits for each technology on a common basis. It should be borne in mind, however, that risk-averse investors may, in practice, discount less proven technologies at a higher rate.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Capital depreciation</title><p>Capital expenditures were depreciated at the discount rate (<italic>i</italic>) over a plant lifetime (<italic>L</italic>) within the sensitivity range of 25&#x02013;45 years.

In practice CI<sub>ref</sub> depends what type of power generation technology would have supplied the energy in the absence of the bioenergy production. Depending on the legislative and economic framework within which the BES is implemented, there can be several different types of drivers of this interaction. Factors that can influence the carbon intensity of offset energy include financial and legislative instruments that may be designed to ensure that new bioenergy capacity allows phase out of the most polluting alternative power sources. Also, competition for available mitigation incentives can lead to bioenergy capacity offsetting other low-carbon alternatives that would otherwise have received available finance. Additionally, market forces or planning objectives may lead to a mixed effect in which bioenergy offsets a mix of technologies whose combined carbon intensity could be the overall energy mix of the existing system, the energy mix of a subset of the existing energy infrastructure (for example, base load or load-following power generation), or the energy mix of new plant that would otherwise have replaced existing capacity as it reaches end-of-life.</p><p>To account for all these possibilities, we use a wide sensitivity range for CI<sub>ref</sub> in all scenarios that includes both high- and low-carbon technologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>) as a Gaussian distribution with mean and s.d. as given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 8</xref>.

Different pyrolysis technologies have different relative yields of energy and BC; fast pyrolysis producing more energy and less BC than slow pyrolysis. When energy is the desired product, BC produced during pyrolysis will typically itself be combusted or gasified to raise the energy production efficiency of the overall process. However, under conditions when it is economically viable to produce BC at the expense of energy (that is, when the value of the BC for soil improvement and carbon sequestration is high enough to offset foregone energy when it is buried in soil), it would then be most economical to maximize BC yields. Therefore, the BC production technology we consider here is slow pyrolysis. We assume that fast pyrolysis would be the preferred technology over slow pyrolysis only in those conditions when energy is more valuable than BC, in which case the BC product of fast pyrolysis would itself be combusted rather than added to soil.</p><p>Techno-economic assessments of pyrolysis for bioenergy have typically focused more on fast pyrolysis (with its higher energy production potential) rather than slow pyrolysis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. Accordingly, there are few detailed estimates of capital costs of slow pyrolysis power generation plants in the published literature. To estimate a realistic uncertainty range for slow pyrolysis power generation capital costs, we, therefore, base the sensitivity range on costs for biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) power generation, for which a substantial literature exists. In an analogous pyrolysis-based configuration (PyGCC), the gasification stage would be replaced with a pyrolysis unit, a cyclone for char separation, and possibly an additional gas conditioning plant to accommodate the higher tar content of pyrolysis gases than gasifier syngas. Due to the lower energy conversion efficiency of slow pyrolysis than gasification, the pyrolysis unit would need to be sized larger per unit electricity generation than a BIGCC gasifier (or conversely, for a given biomass throughput, the electricity generation stage would be smaller in PyGCC than BIGCC). This will also engender an increased size in biomass handling costs per unit power output.</p><p>Gasification accounts for &#x0223c;25&#x02013;30% of BIGCC capital cost<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>.

We assume that biomass handling and gasification costs are scaled from BIGCC to PyGCC in proportion to the ratio of syngas fuel produced per unit biomass in a gasifier or pyrolyser (on an energy basis). Energy conversion efficiency is in the range of 75&#x02013;85% for gasification<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. For pyrolysis, energy conversion efficiency is in the range 37&#x02013;60% (see pyrolysis mass and energy balance, below), where higher values correspond to pyrolysis at 600&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with biomass being used as the fuel for heat supply; and lower values correspond to pyrolysis at 450&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, with syngas providing the fuel for heat supply). To account for additional costs of BC handling and tar cracking, we also add a further 25% of the pyrolyser cost to the overall PyGCC system<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>.

The number of Monte Carlo simulations plotted was limited to 4,500 (750 randomly sampled from each of the six scenario-year combinations) to prevent over-cluttering the plot and to ensure high visibility of the main trends. Parameter values are normalized linearly within their sample ranges so that the <italic>y</italic> axes of all parameters share a common scale that is linearly interpolated between the parameter minimum and maximum. Line transparency is graduated by RPV (darker, less transparent lines for higher RPV), also to increase visibility of the main trends.

Each panel is divided in two with three response variables (relative present values of BES, BEBCS or BECCS) on the left of the solid line, and the 12 most important independent parameters on the right. Each parameter has three bars (blue, pink and yellow) for parameter ranges in the years 2020, 2050 and 2100, respectively.
