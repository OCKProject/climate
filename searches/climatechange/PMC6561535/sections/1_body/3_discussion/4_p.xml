<p class="p">Further, the solar energy industry is rapidly expanding into the range of the kit fox, and many solar panel installations are planned in areas that currently serve as habitat for the species, with unknown consequences. Solar development was not included in the landuse change models that we used. Instead, we assessed the probable impact of solar farm development by quantifying the amount of overlap between potential solar habitat (from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory) and kit fox habitat. We found that 45.5% of the best habitat (suitability greater than 90%) overlaps with areas designated by areas of potential solar development, but the impacts to kit foxes are unknown.</p>
