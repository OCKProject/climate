<p class="p">Second, vegetation changes across the Tehachapi Pass could encourage hybridization between the San Joaquin kit fox and other sub-species of kit fox. No foxes crossed this pass in our current-conditions scenarioâ€“a conclusion supported by the literature on kit fox genetics, which suggests that these populations have been separated for some time [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Modeled foxes did occasionally cross the pass in one of the climate change scenarios (CCSM), which shows grassland and desert scrub vegetation over the Tehachapi Pass. Although these mountains are steep and are therefore not conducive to use by kit foxes, that may not preclude individuals from occasionally dispersing across the mountains, given suitable vegetation. Hybridization between these subpopulations will have important implications for genetic diversity of kit foxes and for the persistence of kit foxes more generally in the San Joaquin Valley, but it is unclear whether the benefits in terms of persistence of the species outweigh the costs associated with the loss of a subspecies. As shown with our models, increased climate variability could cause extinctions of local San Joaquin kit fox populations within the valley, and dispersing kit foxes from the Mojave Desert could recolonize these habitats.
