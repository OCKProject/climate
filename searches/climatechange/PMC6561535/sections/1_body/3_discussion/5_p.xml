<p class="p">Although climate change is poised to negatively impact many species of plants and animals around the globe, our results indicate that land-use change and pesticide use will likely have a much stronger negative effect on the San Joaquin kit fox. Indirect effects of climate change on vegetation in the region may actually have positive effects on kit foxes by increasing the extent of their habitat. The degree to which this positive effect is countered by detrimental impacts such as precipitation-driven changes in prey availability is yet to be seen, although our results indicate that the positive impact on vegetation could outweigh at least this one other negative climate impact. A scenario that combines threats and that specifically addresses stressor interactions could be run to assess the impacts on the fox population and determine possible interactions between threats. Our results highlight the importance of considering the impacts that multiple disturbance regimes will have on population dynamics.</p>
