<p class="p">The endangered San Joaquin kit fox faces pressures from multiple stressors. Projected land-use changes in California’s Central Valley will continue to reduce habitat for this species. Over the same time period, reduced summer precipitation and hotter temperatures can be expected to promote the growth of the grassland and scrub vegetation types that provide habitat for kit foxes. In some parts of the species’ range, such as the area east of Bakersfield (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214297.s003" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>), future habitat loss due to land conversion may be mitigated by climate-change induced range expansion. Thus, the kit fox could be an example of a species that benefits from climate change, though there are multiple reasons why this conclusion could prove overly optimistic (e.g., climate-driven increases in competition or disease).
