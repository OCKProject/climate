<p class="p">Projected vegetation changes also open up a swath of suitable habitat (grassland and scrub vegetation) across two passes separating Bakersfield and Barstow (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214297.s003" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Much of this habitat is steep and mountainous, and therefore less suitable as kit fox habitat. Kit foxes generally do not use steep slopes as habitat, but it is unclear whether they use these areas for dispersal. We simulated movement in todayâ€™s landscape and in two future, climate-altered landscapes to look for indications of emergent connectivity between the Mojave Desert and the Central Valley fox populations. For this experiment, we substituted male dispersal distances for the female dispersal distances in our model (our original model was a female-only model, and therefore had smaller, female-specific dispersal distances): we allowed foxes to search for a home range along a path with a mean distance of 6.4 km and a standard deviation of 2 km. We ran 100 repetitions of these scenarios over 200 year periods and mapped the routes and frequency of dispersing animals. Simulated kit foxes did indeed disperse between the Mojave Desert and the Central Valley fox populations, although in small numbers and in only one of the two projected future climate scenarios (
