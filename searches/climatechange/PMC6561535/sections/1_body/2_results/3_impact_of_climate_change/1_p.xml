<p class="p">The two scenarios of climate change we considered both resulted in an increase in the quantity of kit fox habitat and a corresponding slight increase in fox population numbers in much of the speciesâ€™ range (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214297.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). Both climate models predicted conversion from forest and woodland to grasslands around the perimeter of the San Joaquin Valley. The net increase in grasslands was just over 50% for each model. The CCSM model also predicts a doubling of scrub habitat (see
