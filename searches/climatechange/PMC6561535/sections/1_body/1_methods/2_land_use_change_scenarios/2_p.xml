<p class="p">To build habitat suitability maps for both scenarios and for 10-year increments, we began with a baseline kit fox habitat suitability map [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and then used projected land-use changes provided by UPlan to alter this map (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0214297.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). New suitability values were assigned using the same habitat suitability values as the original habitat suitability model. For the two classes not described by the habitat model (high density commercial and residential with 10-acre lots), we estimated intermediate values. The land-use change scenarios were developed for the year 2050, so we interpolated intermediate years at 10-year increments by randomly selecting 1/5 of the projected change for each of five 10-year periods. By convention, we always used the minimum habitat suitability value taken from the projected UPlan land-use map and the baseline map. We assumed that the rare increases in habitat suitability were due to mapping errors given that the scenarios included no abandonment of agricultural or developed land, but rather only added new development. We then used these new habitat suitability maps in our kit fox simulation model for the ensuing 10-year periods.
