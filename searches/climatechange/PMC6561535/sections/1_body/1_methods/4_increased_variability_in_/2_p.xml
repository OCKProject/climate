<p class="p">We simulated the potential effects of increasing extremes in precipitation on reproduction by varying reproductive rates in the model. We modeled the effect of increasing inter-annual variability in rainfall by increasing the variability of the foxes’ reproductive success. To simulate this in our model, we created “average,” “good” and “bad” year categories which subsequently influenced reproduction. In each time step, the quality of the year was chosen randomly with the following probabilities: good (1/5), bad (1/5), and average (3/5). Reproductive output (number of foxes born) in a good year had an expected value that was 80% greater than that of an average year.A bad year had an expected value that was 80% less than an average year. These reproductive rates and probabilities of good and bad years are based upon models of rainfall impact on kit fox [
