<p class="p">We also considered the effects of climate change on kit fox reproduction. Models generally agree that extreme precipitation events are likely to become more common and intense in California [

 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>], which in turn could cause more variability in kit fox population sizes. It is also expected that interannual variation in precipitation could lead to more consecutive dry days, which could negatively impact kit fox reproduction. The densities of the kit foxes’ preferred prey—herbivorous and granivorous rodents—are closely tied to primary productivity, and therefore, to rainfall. Kit fox populations are generally regulated by the availability of their prey and thus, population numbers tend to fluctuate with rainfall [
