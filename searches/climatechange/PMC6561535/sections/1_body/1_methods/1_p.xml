 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] to simulate dispersal, prospecting, and resource acquisition. Our model integrated life history traits, repeated exposures to rodenticides, and spatial data layers describing habitat and locations of likely exposures. We modeled female kit foxes using yearly time steps in which each individual had the potential to disperse, establish a home range, acquire resources from their habitat, reproduce, accumulate rodenticide exposures, and die. Simulated kit foxes established home ranges with sizes that were inversely proportional to habitat quality. Both survival and reproductive were influenced by resource allocation, with resource-poor individuals experiencing lower vital rates. Density dependence emerged as a consequence of the competition between individuals for finite available resources. The probability that an individual was exposed to rodenticides varied based on land cover class [
