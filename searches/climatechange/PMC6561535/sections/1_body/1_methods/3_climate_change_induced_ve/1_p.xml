<p class="p">We incorporated the effects of climate change in two ways. First, we considered the long-term effects of changes in precipitation and temperature on habitat structure. We used projected future potential vegetation from an empirical model linking broad vegetation types to climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. We used model outputs based on climate-change projections from the Community Climate System Model (CCSM3.0) from the National Center for Atmospheric Research for the period from 2038–2069 and the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) model for the period from 2038–2070. We then measured the change in kit fox habitat suitability between the modeled future climate and the modeled current climate and applied this difference to the baseline habitat suitability map and the modeled suitability for each time increment. The future vegetation maps were averages from approximately 2038–2069. We interpolated the change in 10-year increments from 2010–2040, and then used the average value from 2040 through the end of the simulation.
