<p class="p">To simulate the likely impacts of rodenticide exposure on kit fox populations, we used a map of areas of likely exposure to rodenticides developed from pesticide-use data reported to the California Department of Pesticide Regulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], liver tests of kit foxes [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and landowner surveys [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. We used California agricultural databases, surveys of residents, and results from laboratory measurements to assemble a map quantifying the potential for rodenticide exposure [
 <xref rid="pone.0214297.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Territorial kit foxesâ€™ exposure was based on the placement and size of their home range. For non-territorial kit foxes, exposure was based on the areas that were visited in the process of prospecting for a territory. Newborn kit foxes were assigned the same exposure value as their mothers. For the purposes of influencing vital rates, kit foxes which experienced any exposure were placed into either "low", "medium", or "high" exposure bins, with the bin boundaries set to ensure that roughly 1/3 of the population fell into each exposure class. We imposed pesticide-induced mortality rates upon individuals that the model suggested would become exposed to rodenticides on the landscape. These exposure risks were accumulated throughout each season, resulting in an overall exposure for each annual time step. Here, we consider an intermediate exposure effect scenario wherein foxes that were exposed to rodenticides suffered an additional 2% - 25% mortality rate, depending on the amount of exposure.
