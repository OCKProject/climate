<p class="p">Here, we assessed the effects of land-use change, climate change, or exposure to rodenticides on kit fox populations, across their range, using a spatially-explicit individual-based model. We estimated current population size for the fox from 2010â€“2060 and assessed how this number might change under simulated future disturbance scenarios. In addition to current conditions, we modeled two land-use change scenarios and three climate-change scenarios, as well as the impacts of rodenticide exposure.</p>
