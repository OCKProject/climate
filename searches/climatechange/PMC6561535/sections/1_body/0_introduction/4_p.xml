<p class="p">The San Joaquin kit fox (
 <italic class="italic">Vulpes macrotis mutica</italic>, “kit fox”) is an endangered subspecies of the more widely occurring kit fox. These kit foxes live in the arid grass- and shrub-lands around the perimeter of the San Joaquin Valley in central California, where they preferably hunt kangaroo rats, but also consume ground squirrels, rats, mice, birds, and insects. The current population size of the kit fox is unknown, but is estimated to be fewer than 4200 individuals [
