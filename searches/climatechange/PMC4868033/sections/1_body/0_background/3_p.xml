<p class="p">In contrast with the solid evidence base for the association between heat and health in some western European countries, research is scarce in south-eastern European countries, particularly those outside the EU. There is, however, some evidence on the association between heat and health from urban settings in Serbia and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Stanojevic et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>] estimated that 253 persons died due to heat waves in Belgrade during the summer of 2007, during which temperature records were broken in many monitoring stations in in the country. In the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the summer heat waves of 2007 resulted in more than 1000 excess deaths at the national level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Intensity and duration of heat waves were the two main factors predicting episodes of excess mortality in Skopje and Belgrade, and both of these coincided during the heat waves in summer 2007 making that summer the most severe in the researched period [
