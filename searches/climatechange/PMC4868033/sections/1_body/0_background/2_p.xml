<p class="p">Baccini et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>] studied the relationship between increased maximum apparent temperatures and mortality in 15 European cities, finding an increase in mortality of 3.1 % (95 % CI: 0.6–5.7) in Mediterranean cities and an increase of 1.8 % (95 % CI: 0.1–3.6) in north-continental cities for every 1 °C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a city-specific threshold. An additional study, conducted across 12 European cities, found a positive, but variable, association between temperature and hospital admissions for respiratory disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. For each 1 °C increase above a city-specific threshold in maximum apparent temperature, respiratory admissions increased by up to 4.5 % in Mediterranean cities compared to 3.1 % in north-continental cities.
