 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] due to the comparative abundance of heat-absorbing surfaces and materials, a phenomenon known as “urban heat island” effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Other factors, like household insulation and access to air conditioning, socioeconomic factors, and individual vulnerability, may exacerbate heat-related risks for some specific urban populations or areas [

 <italic class="italic">likely</italic> that climate change-driven increases in daily maximum temperatures may have already increased the number of heat-related deaths. This hypothesis has not been conclusively proven; a recent study found a decrease in the relative risk for heat-related mortality in 2006 compared with 1993 in several countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, climate change scenarios almost unanimously project rising temperatures and an increase in frequency and intensity of heat waves globally and in the European Region [
