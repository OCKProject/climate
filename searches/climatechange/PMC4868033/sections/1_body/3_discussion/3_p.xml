<p class="p">In assessing the future impact of heat on mortality in Skopje, we accounted for several sources of uncertainty. While we used a Monte Carlo approach to account for sampling variability around the estimate of heatâ€“mortality relationship [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>], uncertainty related to future weather conditions was treated by generating annual temperature time series under different climate models and uncertainty related to population predictions was treated by using simple alternative population growth models. The contribution of each source of variability to the total variance of AD predictions was evaluated. Total variance was largely explained by differences among climate models. However, inter-annual variability of temperatures and sampling variability around threshold and slope estimates also had an important role, strongly impacting on the final variance. The contribution of the population projections to the total variance was small. Wu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] found a similar result when evaluating the future impact of heat waves on mortality in the eastern United States. However, it should be stressed that in our study the variability associated to population projections is strongly dependent on the specific growth models adopted. We cannot exclude that using different and more complex models, population projections could appear more critical to the final impacts, as has been reported elsewhere [
