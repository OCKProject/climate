<p class="p">Our approach has several limitations. We assumed that the heatâ€“mortality relationship does not change over time due to possible acclimatization/mitigation/adaptation of the city population, despite the decrease in negative impacts of heat during recent decades reported in the recent literature, possibly due to increasing availability of adaptation-oriented technologies, implementation of heat warning systems, and behavioural changes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Moreover, we estimated this relationship on a limited number of years: from 2007 to 2011. On the one hand, this is an obvious limitation because a longer time series would have provided more stable results; on the other hand, by limiting the analysis to recent years, we have likely produced an estimate of the heat-mortality relationship with a higher chance of being valid in future time periods.
