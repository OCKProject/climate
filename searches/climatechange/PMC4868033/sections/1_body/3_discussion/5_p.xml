<p class="p">We focused on the effect of mean temperatures exceeding the estimated threshold, assuming a linear effect of heat above this threshold (on a logarithmic scale). We considered neither the possible additional effect of heat waves nor deviations from linearity for very high exposures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. We preferred this simple parametrization than a flexible modelling of the heatâ€“mortality relationship for two main reasons: first, the boundary regions of the estimated curve can be very sensitive to outlying observations, so that for the highest temperatures the external validity of the curve could be compromised by the strong influence of a few observations; second, summarizing the relationship of interest by only two parameters (threshold and slope) permitted to implement the Monte Carlo approach in a simpler way. However, this choice has some consequences: mainly, we expect that the impacts can be underestimated for large exposures, leading to conservative results.
