<p class="p">Only one Representative Concentration Pathway climate scenario has been used. Ideally, other RCPâ€™s should be used as well, but this requires much larger computational resources that what was available for this study. These results, based on RCP8.5, represent an upper bound for the temperatures (and hence the mortality, accounting for population increase and everything else being equal). However, it is important to stress that current emission trends thus far seem to continue to track along the trends of this scenario.</p>
