<p class="p">The heat–mortality relationship estimated for Skopje for the sample period 2007–2011 is consistent with the results reported in the literature for other European cities. In particular, when maximum apparent temperature was used as exposure indicator, allowing comparison with published studies, we estimated a threshold equal to 30.6 °C and a variation above the threshold equal to 4.47 % (90 % CI: 2.56; 6.42). These values are similar to those obtained for the Mediterranean cities in the PHEWE study [
