<p class="p">During the baseline period 1986–2005, and assuming that the exposure–response functions stayed constant over time, we estimated that daily mean temperatures above the threshold were responsible on average for 58 deaths per year (slightly less than during the sample period 2007–2011), corresponding to an average AF of 3.3 %, that is close to the AFs estimated for Budapest and Turin during the 1990s by Baccini and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Under the assumption that the heat–mortality relationship in the last 30 years was unchanged and equal to that estimated for the sample period 2007–2011, this result suggests that heat during the summer has been in the past, and is currently, an important public health problem in Skopje. An increasing impact of heat, given the set of assumptions used in this study, would be expected in the future. Considering all different combinations of climate models and population growth models, the average number of AD per year is expected to range from 95 to 125 for the time period 2026–2045, and from 186 to 366 for the time period 2081–2100, when AF could reach 13.2 %, under the maximal climate model.
