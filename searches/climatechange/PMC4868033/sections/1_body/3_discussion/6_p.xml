<p class="p">Our approach did not account for the inter-relation between population growth and changes in the urban landscape, which could result in significant alterations of urban temperatures and the urban heat island effect. In addition, future population size and climate conditions were assumed to be independent; while this may be a reasonable assumption for analysis at the local level, ideally, multifactor models like the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways should be used [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] produced such predictions for Skopje (but only until 2030) whereby the city population is expected to increase in the coming years (despite the expected decrease of the national population). These predictions followed rates similar to those estimated up to 2030 by our models. A further limitation of the adopted population growth models is that they do not provide projections of the future age-structure of the city population. This limitation, coupled with the difficulty of obtaining stable estimates of the heatâ€“mortality relationship by class of age, prevented us from performing age-stratified impact assessment.
