<p class="p">The daily urban temperatures for Skopje were obtained as unweighted means of the grid cell temperatures arising from the UrbClim model. In the absence of fine spatial projections of the population distribution within the city boundaries, and considering that people move from their residence during the day experiencing different exposure levels within the city, using a single urban exposure was an obvious choice. The validity of this choice is supported also by the high agreement between the daily mean temperatures in the ten districts of Skopje under all climate models and time periods (results not reported).</p>
