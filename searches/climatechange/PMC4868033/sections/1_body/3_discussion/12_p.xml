<p class="p">Acknowledging these limitations, the importance of our results in the context of health adaptation against heat is clear. In the absence of adequate interventions and of significant acclimatization, a strong increase in heat-related mortality may be expected in Skopje. In light of warming projections in South East Europe, and pending further research, similar trends may occur in other urban areas in the Balkans. Regarding what constitutes “adequate interventions”, a recent review of the evidence suggests that heat-warning systems coupled with specific actions (health information plans, cooling centres, etc.) are effective in reducing health effects from heat [
