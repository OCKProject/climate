<p class="p">AFs for the period 2026–2045 are expected to range from 4.7 % under the minimal climate model to 6.6 % under the maximal model. For the period 2081–2100, AFs are expected to range from 8.1 % to 13.2 %. Assuming an exponential model for population growth, heat is expected to be responsible on average for 124 deaths per year during the period 2026–2045 under the median climate model, and for 100 and 125 deaths under the minimum and the maximum climate models, respectively. Using logistic models for population prediction did not bring substantially different results.</p>
