<p class="p">As a preliminary result, we obtained the impact of heat during the sample period 2007–2011. We estimated that during this period 4.5 % of deaths during the warm seasons were attributable to mean temperatures exceeding the estimated threshold of 19.7 °C, corresponding to 74 deaths per year (10
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 90
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> quantile: 52; 95). This result was obtained using the historical mortality and temperature data used to estimate the heat–mortality relationship and applying equations (2) and (3).
