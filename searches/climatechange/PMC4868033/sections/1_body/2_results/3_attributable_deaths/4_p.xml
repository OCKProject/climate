This estimate is slightly lower than the estimate obtained for the sample period 2007–2011; this difference is likely due to the specific meteorological characteristics of the period 2007–2011, during which one important heat wave was observed in the Balkans, including the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (in summer 2007) [
