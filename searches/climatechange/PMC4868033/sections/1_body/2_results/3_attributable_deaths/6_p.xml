<p class="p">For the period 2081–2100, under the exponential model for population growth, 272 AD per year are expected under the median climate model, 223 and 366 AD per year under the minimum and the maximum climate models, respectively. Using logistic models, lower predictions were obtained, with the number of AD decreasing as the carrying capacity parameter decreased.</p>
