<p class="p">For each combination of climate and population models, the inter-percentile range was very large, so that the intervals partially overlapped even when the maximum and the minimum climate models were compared. It should be noticed that reported inter-percentile ranges derive from sampling variability around threshold and slope and inter-annual variability of climate projections.</p>
