<p class="p">As explained, three different global climate models were used in the health impact assessment: MRI-CGCM3, IPSL-CM5A-MR and GISS-E2-R. These models correspond respectively to the models which, of all eleven considered models, exhibit the lowest, the maximal and the median temperature for the far future period (2081–2100). Henceforth, we refer to them as the minimal (MRI-CGCM3), the maximal (IPSL-CM5A-MR) and the median (GISS-E2-R) climate model. For all three models, daily mean temperatures for Skopje under RCP8.5 have been obtained for the baseline period (1986–2005), and the two future periods (2026–2045 and 2081–2100) [see section 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Current and future climate assessment</xref>]. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> summarizes the mean and 95th percentile of the daily mean temperatures by time periods and climate model. Under the median climate model, the average of the daily mean temperatures is expected to be 22.9 °C in 2026–2045 and 26.1 °C in 2081–2100, compared with an average of 20.7 °C in the baseline period 1986–2005. Under the minimal model, the projected average is 21.6 °C in 2026–2045 and 24.6 °C in 2081–2100. Under the maximal model, the average in 2026–2045 is expected to be only slightly higher than under the median model, while it is expected to reach 28.5 °C in 2081–2100, with the 5 % of days having daily mean temperature larger than 37.7 °C.
