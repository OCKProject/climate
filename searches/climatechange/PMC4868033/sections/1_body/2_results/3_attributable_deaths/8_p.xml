 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> shows AD predictions obtained for each year during the time laps of interest under the three climate models, after assuming an exponential model on population growth; red lines correspond to the average number of AD per year during the three time periods. A clear acceleration of heat impact over time is visible under the maximal climate model. Inter-annual variability of AD predictions appeared to be substantial, so that the lowest annual peaks under the maximal climate model and the highest annual peaks under the minimum climate model are expected to be close one to each other.
