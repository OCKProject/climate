<p class="p">Based on the series of daily mean temperatures for Skopje under RCP8.5, the projected AFs and the projected numbers of AD under different population models were calculated by applying equations (2) and (4). It should be noted that for the baseline period 1986–2005, the three climate models are calibrated to match the current climatic conditions described by the ERA-interim reanalysis data, so their values coincide and, as a consequence, AFs and AD overlap. Therefore, for the period 1986–2005, only the impacts obtained under the median climate model are presented.</p>
