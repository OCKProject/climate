<p class="p">The total-effect indexes for each source of variability are reported in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>. When considering the baseline period, AD estimation involved only two sources of variability: sampling variability around threshold and slope, and inter-annual variability, contributing to 27.8 and 80.4 % of total variance, respectively. It should be noted that the total-effect indexes do not add up to 1, because they can include the common contribution of shared interactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. When considering the period 2026–2045, the most relevant source was still inter-annual variability; while when considering the period 2081–2100, total variance was mostly explained by differences among climate models (46.6 %). Sampling variability around threshold and slope was a very important source of uncertainty, explaining 39.2 % of total variance for the period 2026–2045 and 40.3 % for the period 2081–2100. The model used in the population projections was not a major source of uncertainty, as indicated by the low value of the corresponding total-effect index.
