<p class="p">We obtained projections of the future population size under different models. The population growth from 2002 to 2100 under an exponential model and logistic models with different carrying capacity (K = 1,000,000; 900,000; 800,000; 700,000) are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. The vertical lines indicate the initial population (P
 <sub class="sub">2002</sub>) and the population after 10 years (P
 <sub class="sub">2012</sub>); these values were assumed as fixed and used to estimate the parameters of the population growth models. While the four models produced similar short-medium population size predictions, the expected number of inhabitants in 2100 tended to diverge in the long term.
