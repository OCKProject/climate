<p class="p">The average relationship between ambient temperatures and mortality in Skopje was ascertained for the sample period (2007–2011). This relationship can be described through an exposure–response curve. The non-parametric curve describing the relationship between lag 0–3 days of mean temperature and mortality in 2007–2011 is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. As expected, mortality decreases with temperature to a certain point, or threshold, beyond which it increases again. The relationship above the threshold is not far from linearity if we exclude very high exposures, for which, anyway, the confidence bands around the estimated curve are very large.
