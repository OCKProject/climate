<p class="p">The maximum likelihood estimate of the threshold, i.e. the temperature associated with the minimum mortality rate, was 19.7 °C (90 % CI: 18.5; 20.9). Above this threshold, the estimated change in mortality associated with 1 °C increase in mean temperature was 1.70 % (90 % CI: 0.78; 2.64); under the threshold a reverse relation was found: decreasing exposure of 1 °C, mortality increased by 4.11 % (90 % CI: 2.33; 5.92). When considering maximum apparent temperature lag 0–3 days as exposure indicator; the shape of the curve was confirmed, but the minimum was around 30 °C and the change above the threshold was 4.47 % (90 % CI: 2.56; 6.42). After removing the air pollution term from the model, the threshold estimate did not change, but the percent increase above the threshold was slightly higher: 2.09 % (90 % CI: 1.28, 2.91), suggesting that by adjusting for PM
