<p class="p">The geographical area under study comprises the 10 districts within the municipality of Skopje (not including Sopište, physically segregated from the Skopje agglomeration). With the aim to assess the impact of heat on mortality in this area during the baseline period 1986–2005, the near future period 2026–2045 and the far future period 2081–2100 under RCP8.5, we first focused on the estimation of the heat–mortality relationship, to be successively used for health impact assessment, based on the historical data from a sample period, comprising the years 2007–2011, and on the current estimates and predictions of the future population size. Then we combined these results with the meteorological projections for the three time periods to calculate the impact of heat in terms of attributable deaths (AD). In the following sections we describe the statistical models used for the analysis and their underlying assumptions.</p>
