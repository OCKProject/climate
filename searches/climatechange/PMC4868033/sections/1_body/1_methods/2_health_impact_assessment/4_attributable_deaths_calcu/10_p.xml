<p class="p">We used a Monte Carlo approach to account for sampling variability around the estimates of β
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. We assumed a Normal distribution for both these parameters, with mean equal to the point estimate arising from the time series model and variance equal to the estimated variance. Then we independently sampled 10,000 values from these two Normal distributions and we used these values to calculate AD according to equations (2)–(4). In this way we obtained, for each climate model and each time period, a sample of 10,000 values from the AD distribution for each warm season of interest. We did not account for sampling variability around proportion γ and crude mortality rate r, which were considered known and constant over time
