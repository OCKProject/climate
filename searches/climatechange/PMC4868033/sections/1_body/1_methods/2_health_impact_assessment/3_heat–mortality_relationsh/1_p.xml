<p class="p">In order to estimate the heat–mortality relationship to be successively used for health impact assessment, we collected daily number of deaths from all causes. The complete daily mortality dataset was obtained from the country’s Institute of Public Health. In order to assure homogeneity between historical and future predicted meteorological data, daily temperature and humidity data for the sample period 2007–2011 were obtained by coupling the UrbClim model to the ERA-interim reanalysis data of ECMWF large-scale meteorological data, as discussed in section
