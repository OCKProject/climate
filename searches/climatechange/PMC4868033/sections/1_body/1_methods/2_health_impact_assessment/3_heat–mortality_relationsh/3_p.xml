 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>], we focused only on the warm seasons (1 Mayâ€“30 September), so data consisted of five disjointed five-month daily time series. The outcome variable was the daily death count with assumed Poisson distribution. After assuming independence between summers and a first-order autocorrelation structure for the daily death counts within the same summer period, the analysis was based on a generalized estimating equations (GEE) approach, without robust adjustment of the standard errors, as recommended in the presence of few large clusters [

We included dummy variables in the models to account for holidays, day of the week and calendar month; linear and quadratic terms to pick up the yearly long-term time trend; linear and quadratic terms for dew point; linear term for the average of the current and the previous day concentration of PM
