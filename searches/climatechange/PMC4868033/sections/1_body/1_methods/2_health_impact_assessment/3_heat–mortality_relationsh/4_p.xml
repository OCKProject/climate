<p class="p">The literature does not provide clear indication on which is the best temperature indicator to investigate the effect of heat on mortality. Moreover, due to the strong correlation between different indicators, comparable results can be expected from using different indexes, for example daily mean or daily maximum temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Here, we focused on daily mean temperature. In particular, we studied the immediate effect of heat, considering as exposure indicator lag 0–3 days of mean temperature, defined as the average of the mean temperature in the current day and in the previous 3 days. With the aim to allow comparison with the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] we repeated the analysis using as exposure indicator lag 0–3 days of maximum apparent temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>].
