<p class="p">For validation of the model-generated series of temperature data, and in the absence of historical intra-urban data series of temperature measured within Skopje, we obtained hourly temperature time series measured at the Skopje airport through the online portal of the US National Climatic Data Center (NCDC,

Although this location lies just outside the city domain of the UrbClim model, the measurements can still be used to validate the rural temperatures around Skopje modelled by UrbClim. When considering the warm seasons (1 May–30 September, which corresponds with the dates of operation of the country’s heat wave early-warning system), these daily data were strongly correlated with those measured at the airport. For the summer of 2007 we obtained, for daily mean temperatures, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96, and a bias of 0.5 degrees Celsius (with the UrbClim results being slightly warmer than the measurements). Similar results were obtained for the other years in the period 2007 – 2011. The magnitude of the differences is not related to the heat level, as similar correlations and biases are obtained when only the 20 % warmest or 20 % coolest summer days are taken into account. Although the correlations and bias for the mean temperatures indicate a very good comparison between the model and measured data, there are larger biases for daily minimal and maximal temperature. However, since the mortality analysis makes use of the mean daily values, these deviations in the daily pattern are of less importance.
