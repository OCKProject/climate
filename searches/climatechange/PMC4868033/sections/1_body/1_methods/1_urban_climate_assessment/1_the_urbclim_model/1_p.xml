<p class="p">In this study, the current and the future urban climate in Skopje was simulated through the UrbClim model, an urban climate model designed to study the urban heat island effect (UHI) at a spatial resolution of a few hundred metres, for a typical domain size of 20 km by 20 km. The model scales down large-scale weather conditions to agglomeration-scale and computes the impact of urban development on the most important weather parameters, such as temperature and humidity. UrbClim is composed of a land surface scheme describing the physics of energy and water exchange between the soil and the atmosphere in the city, coupled to a three-dimensional boundary layer module, which models the atmosphere above the urban agglomeration. The synoptic (large-scale) atmospheric conditions are taken from global model output fields. Local terrain and surface data influence the heat fluxes and evaporation within the urban boundaries. A detailed description of the model is provided in De Ridder [

The model has been subjected to exhaustive validation; within the scope of the European RAMSES and NACLIM projects, model results have been compared with hourly temperature measurements for, amongst others, London (United Kingdom), Bilbao (Spain), Antwerp (Belgium), Berlin (Germany), Almada (Portugal) and Paris (France) [
