<p class="p">The terrain input for the current study consists of the spatial distribution of land use types, the degree of covering of the soil by artificial structures such as buildings and roads, and the vegetation cover fraction with a spatial resolution of 250 metres. These quantities were taken from publicly available data sets, specifically, the 2006 CORINE Land Cover data for Europe, the European Environment Agency soil sealing data, and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) acquired by the MODIS instrument on the TERRA satellite, respectively.</p>
