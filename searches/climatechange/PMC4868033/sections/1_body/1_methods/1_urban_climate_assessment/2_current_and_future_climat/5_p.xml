<p class="p">The future urban climate in Skopje has been simulated for all 11 GCMs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. However, due to computational limitations, only three of the 11 climate models were used for assessing future impact of heat on population health in Skopje: MRI-CGCM3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>], IPSL-CM5A-MR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] and GISS-E2-R [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. These models correspond respectively to the models that, of all 11 considered models, exhibit the lowest, the maximal and the median mean temperature for the far future period (2081â€“2100). Hence, this selection of three GCMs mimics the spread of the complete set of 11 GCMs.
