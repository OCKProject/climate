<p class="p">The outcomes of the simulations were hourly temperature maps of Skopje with a resolution of 250 metres. We obtained maps for the three different GCMs (MRI-CGCM3, IPSL-CM5A-MR and GISS-E2-R) for the three different time periods (1986–2005, 2026–2045 and 2081–2100). Then the urban daily mean temperature was obtained by calculating the average of the daily mean temperatures of the grid cells within the city boundaries of Skopje. These urban temperatures are hereafter used in the health impact assessment.</p>
