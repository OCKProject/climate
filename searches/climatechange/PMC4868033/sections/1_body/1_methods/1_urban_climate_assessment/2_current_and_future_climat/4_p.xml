<p class="p">The UrbClim model requires forcing by an ensemble of GCM outputs in order to properly represent the uncertainty associated with the global climate projections. That allows obtaining mean values, tendencies and an uncertainty range. The IPCC AR5 endorses this as good practice, highlighting that the agreement between ensemble means and climate data exceeds the agreement with any single climate model by a large amount [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. Based on data requirements of the UrbClim model and data availability, 11 GCMs were selected (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] for an overview of these models). The IPCC also identifies three timeframes: a baseline period (1986–2005), a near future period (2026–2045) and an end-of-century time period (2081–2100) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. We used the same time frames in our simulations. Note that, for the urban climate projections, the ERA-interim runs described above are considered as the benchmark for all future climate projections; we therefore introduce a bias correction which effectively reduces the difference between the ERA-Interim runs and the GCM runs for the baseline period [
