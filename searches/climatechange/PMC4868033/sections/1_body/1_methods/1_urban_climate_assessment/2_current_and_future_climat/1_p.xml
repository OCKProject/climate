<p class="p">The current urban climate of Skopje was simulated by coupling UrbClim to large-scale meteorological data of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF): for the period 1986â€“2012 the model was coupled to ERA-Interim reanalysis data of the ECMWF. The results are hourly temperature maps of Skopje with a resolution of 250 metres. In the mortality analysis and in the impact assessment, a single urban mean temperature was considered for each day, obtained by calculating the mean of the daily mean temperatures of all the grid points within the city boundaries of Skopje.</p>
