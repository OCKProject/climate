<p class="p">To assess the future urban climate of Skopje, UrbClim was coupled to the output of global climate models (GCMs) contained in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) archive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The details of the coupling are described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], so here we only highlight the points important for the assessment at hand. By coupling UrbClim to the output of the GCMs, we obtain projections for the urban heat island in Skopje in the future. Note that the methodology at hand considers the urban form to be constant over time. As such, the results for the future periods in the remainder of the paper refer to an unchanging and unadapted city.
