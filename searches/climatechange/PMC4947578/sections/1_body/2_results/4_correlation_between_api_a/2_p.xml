<p class="p">To take into the consideration of the complex correlation between API, climates factors, and time (by weeks), results from panel analysis indicated that all meteorological factors were significantly correlated with API in panel pooled models (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4" class="xref">4</xref>). Model 4 indicates that about 20% (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, 20.8% for 2012, and 21.0% for 2013) of the variations in API could be explained by the differences in meteorological factors. Similar results were observed using panel one-way fixed time (weeks) effect models, except for a non-significant association between API and sunshine hours in 2012. Results of the panel fixed models suggest that for 2012 there was a variation of around 30% (
