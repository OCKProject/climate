<p class="p">In the correlation analysis, cities with data for both API and meteorological measures (assessed by weekly averages) were included in 2012 and 2013. Among the matching cities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 49, with both API and climate factors measures), results from univariate correlation analysis indicated that for 2012 and 2013, a significantly negative correlation of average API with average temperature, HI, precipitation, and sunshine hours was observed by weeks, however, a significantly and positively correlation with pressure in 53 weeks of a year (top section in Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>). A further analysis was conducted by stratification of seasons in order to examine whether the association between API and temperature still holds. The results show that this negative association of API with temperature and HI became non-significant in winter in 2012 and 2013. The values of the correlation coefficients of API with temperature and HI were higher in fall and summer in 2012, and in spring and fall in 2013 as compared with the other seasons. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref> shows a three-dimensional relationship of API with time (53 weeks of a year) and temperature. It is clear, time and temperatures were significantly correlated with API, with a higher mean API in the early and late weeks of a year (i.e., around December, January, and February) and in cities with lower temperatures in 2012 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>A) and 2013 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>B).
