 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5" class="xref">5</xref> shows the results from sensitivity analysis. City-level air quality index measured in 2003 was positively associated with total mortality rate in 2012 (i.e., assuming a 10-year time-lag effect between exposure and health outcomes), although the correlation coefficient had borderline significance (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 41, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.304, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.054). The same result was observed with a positive association between air quality index in 2004 and total mortality rate in 2013 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 38, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.253, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.125). A positive and significant association between air quality in 2008 and total mortality rates in 2012 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 76, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.372, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) was observed (i.e., assuming a 5-year time-lag effect between exposure and health outcomes). Significant associations between 4-year annual average air quality index in 2007–2010 and total mortality rates in 2012 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 76, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.364, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001) and 2013 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 73, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.261, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.026) were observed (i.e., assuming a 5-year time-lag effect). On a possible 10-year time-lag effect, there was borderline significant association between a 4-year annual average air quality index in 2002–2005 and total mortality rates in 2013 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 71, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.234, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.049), but a positive and non-significant in 2012 (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 74, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.172, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.143).
