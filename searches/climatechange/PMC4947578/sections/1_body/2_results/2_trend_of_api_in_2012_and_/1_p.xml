 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>A depicts the overall daily average APIs in 2012 vs. 2013. It shows API concentration was higher around the first 3 months (90 days), and the last 2 or 3 months of 2013 as compared with 2012. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>B shows weekly API trend in 2012 vs. 2013. It is clear that mean APIs were lower in the months of July, August, and September in 2012 and 2013 (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">1</xref>A,B). By seasons, the highest average (±SD) of API values were observed in winter (72.47 ± 30.51), followed by spring (67.47 ± 26.13), fall (65.26 ± 23.86), and summer (55.16 ± 21.27) in 2012. A similar seasonal pattern was observed in 2013, except with a slightly higher API recorded in fall than that in spring. The corresponding average APIs in 2013 were 91.61 ± 48.09, 75.64 ± 35.18, 72.10 ± 34.54, and 57.54 ± 21.78 in winter, fall, spring, and summer, respectively. Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">2</xref> shows that among the 120 cities, 5 cities (4%) in 2012 and 21 cities (18%) in 2013 had API &gt;100 (defined as “slightly polluted” – a risk level for vulnerable population, including those who have pre-existing respiratory and/or heart disease, and children, and old adults) for ≥60 days in a year. Of the 120 cities, 16 (13%) in 2012 and 35 (29%) in 2013 experienced a maximum API &gt;300 (defined as “severely polluted”/for all residents) over a year.
