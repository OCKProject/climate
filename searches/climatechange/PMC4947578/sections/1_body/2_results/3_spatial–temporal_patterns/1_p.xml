<p class="p">Using GIS Ring Map technique, Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref> depicts significant variations in mean API across the 120 cities in 2012 and 2013, and the number of cities with an elevated API increased from 2012 to 2013 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>A, shown by different color), and from 2007–2010 to 2013 (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>B). For example, in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>A, the inside surrounding ring with 120 trapezoids represents mean API for each of the 120 cities in 2012, and the second (outside) surrounding ring with 120 trapezoids represents the corresponding cities with mean API in 2013. Four different colors represent the ranges of API by quantile, with blue representing the lowest API group (21.07–60.77), followed by gray (60.78–70.86), yellow (70.87–79.79), and red (≥79.80), respectively. In the study of 120 cities (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>A), for example, City A had a mean API of 77.2 in 2012 (yellow) and 95.8 in 2013 (red). In the three time periods’ analysis (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>B), 80 cities had mean API measures in 2007–2010, 2012, and 2013 (from inside, middle to outside rings). The annual average API in 2007–2010 was 87.0 in City A (red), it was 77.2 in 2012 (yellow), and 95.8 in 2013 (red). Of the 120 cities (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>A), 73 (60.8%) experienced at least an average 10-unit increase in mean API from 2012 to 2013. Of the 80 cities in the three time periods’ study, 49 cities (61.3%) experienced a 10-unit increase in mean API from 2007–2010 to 2013.
