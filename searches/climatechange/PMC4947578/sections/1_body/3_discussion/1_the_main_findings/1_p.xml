<p class="p">The main findings of the study highlight that (1) there was a significant increase in API from 2012 to 2013 in most cities of China. The highest average API was observed in winter, and the lowest in summer in the years 2012 and 2013. A significant spatial clustering of cities with high API was observed, with the highest API observed in Northwest China in 2012, and in North China in 2013. (2) Climatic factors remained significantly correlated with API after controlling time effect in both 2012 and 2013. (3) Increased API was positively and significantly associated with total mortality rate in univariate and partial (SES-adjusted) correlation analyses. The API â€“ total mortality associations in 2012 and 2013 were further confirmed by testing early air quality measures in relation to total mortality in late years.</p>
