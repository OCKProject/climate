<p class="p">Climate change can be caused in part by increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other green-house gases. It is likely to result in changes in temperature, humidity, amount, distribution, and intensity of precipitation events and bring about variation in intensity and frequency of certain extreme weather events (

In our study, significantly negative associations of API with HI, precipitation, and positive association with atmospheric pressure were observed. A higher API in winter and lower value in summer has also been reported by other studies in China. For example, the concentration of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> was higher in winter and spring, but was lower in summer in previous studies conducted in the cities of Xiâ€™an and Guangzhou of China (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). We further confirmed the associations using multivariate panel analysis by taking into consideration of weekly changes in API during a given study year. A significant variation in air quality by seasons may be attributable to the natural climate changes, such as months that are cold less windy in winter, heavy rainfall in summer, and use of different types of heating sources. In winter, coal is the main source of heating in most cities of China, which may be attributed for a poor air quality, or/and for a combined effect of less windy, or inversion during cold months. A dry and dusty spring may account for a relatively higher concentration of air pollutants in spring. While in summer, there are lots of rainy and windy days, which can increase the sedimentation rate in air and increase diffusion of air pollutants. In fall, low temperatures and increased winds do not support diffusion of air pollutants (

 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>). Furthermore, it may be also due to the fact that industrialization in North China occurred much before that in South China. In general, cities in the North have energy consumption from coal and other sources to a greater extent than cities in South China, which may be partly attributable for higher concentrations of air pollutants in the North vs. the South. Although we are unable to examine the details of the associations between air pollutants, climate change, and energy use because of lack of the relevant datasets, findings from our study address the association of API concentration with climatic factors and seasonal variations. Of them, the seasonal variations in API may be partly explained by the different types of energy use (i.e., more coal used in winter for heating), and call for further research.
