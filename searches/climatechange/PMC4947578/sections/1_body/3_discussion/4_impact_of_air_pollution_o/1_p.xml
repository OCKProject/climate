<p class="p">The association between air pollution and public health has been examined in several cities of China. These studies observed a positive association of air pollution with years of potential life lost, total mortality, and mortality from cardiovascular disease and respiratory diseases (

These early studies highlighted the importance of controlled air pollution in urban cities, although they had several limitations, including a small sample size and/or data gathered using different study designs and processes that lead a difficulty in conducting comparative studies across regions and times (

Our study expanded previous studies by utilizing data from China national air and health surveillance systems through which we could successfully test and confirm a significant and positive association between API and total mortality. About 4–7% of the variations in total mortality can be explained by the differences in API across the study cities. The findings, thus, further address the serious impact of air quality on public health.
