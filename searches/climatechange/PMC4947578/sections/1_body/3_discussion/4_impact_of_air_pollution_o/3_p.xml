<p class="p">Despite these limitations discussed above, this study has several advantages as well. First, as compared with all previous published work, this study has the largest sample size on air quality measures from 120 major cities in 2012 and 2013, China. Second, the accuracy and quality of data sources, including API, meteorological factors, and total mortality are reliable as they applied standard study designs and data collection procedures supported by the Chinese government environmental and central healthcare organizations. The approach of using data from national surveillance systems offers a comparable and important baseline study for further studies. Third, the application of the spatial autocorrelation analysis technique in this study helps us to quantitatively test and confirm a spatial clustering of API across China. Fourth, to our knowledge, it is one of the first in the literature of the relevant studies; this study examined the changes in air quality using advanced GIS Ring Map technique. Fifth, a robust sensitivity analysis was conducted using historical air quality measures by taking into consideration a possible time-lag effect between exposures and health outcomes, which thus confirms a positive and strong association between air quality and total mortality.</p>
