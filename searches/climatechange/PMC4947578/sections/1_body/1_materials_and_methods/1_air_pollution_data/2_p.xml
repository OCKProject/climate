<p class="p">It should be noted that air quality data are formally managed and reported by MEP in China. Data for individual pollutant reports are not available to the public and researchers. API, a sum weighted index, calculated using an international standard approach (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>), is the only report and available on air quality information in and before 2013 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). Therefore, we examined the associations between air quality, climate factors, and health outcomes using API as an air quality indicator only.
