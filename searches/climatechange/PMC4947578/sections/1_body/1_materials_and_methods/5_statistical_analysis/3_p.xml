<p class="p">In the third group analysis, because of the nature of the spatial-based cross-sectional and time-series datasets, we applied Panel analysis methods to take into consideration the temporal heterogeneities in API and climate factors. Panel analysis is a statistical method, widely used in environmental science, social science, epidemiology, and economics, which deals with two and “
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>”-dimensional (in and by the – cross-sectional/times series time) panel data (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Data are usually collected for same individuals over time and then a regression is run over these dimensions. There are three commonly used Panel analysis approaches (1) independently pooled model, it assumes that there are no unique attributes of individuals within the measurement set (e.g., spatial), and no universal effects across time; (2) fixed effect model, it assumes that there are unique attributes of individuals that are not the results of random variation (location-specific effect) and that do not vary across time (time-specific effect); and (3) random effect model, it assumes that there are unique, time constant attributes of individuals that are the results of random variation and do not correlate with the individual regressor (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). In the study, we tested the random effect’s hypothesis (i.e., the null hypothesis of no correlation among effects and regressors) using Hausman test (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>), the result showed the time-specific effects of climate factors (HI, precipitation, sunshine, and pressure) on API were not randomly distributed (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the intraclass correlation coefficients of the regressors were highly significant, except for a non-significant correlation between precipitation and pressure in 2013 (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.188) (data not shown). Therefore, we only reported the results from Panel analysis fixed effect models.
