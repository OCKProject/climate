<p class="p">In the fourth group analysis, the association between city-level annual average API and annual total mortality rates were examined using univariate and partial (adjusted) correlation analysis. In the partial correlation analysis, we adjusted for city-level socioeconomic status (assessed by GDP per capita) and percentage of residents who were aged 60 and older in individual cities. In the final report, we highlighted the results of adjustment for each covariate individually, because of giving a relatively small sample size and applying a city-level ecological study design, increasing the number of covariates in the adjustment would lead to significantly lower statistical powers.</p>
