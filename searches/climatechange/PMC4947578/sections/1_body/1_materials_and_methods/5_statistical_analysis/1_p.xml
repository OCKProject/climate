<p class="p">In the first group analysis, univariate analyses were conducted to describe the patterns of daily, weekly, seasonal, and yearly average of API across cities and regions. Spline regression technique was also applied to depict API variation by time. We classified seasons as spring (March, April, and May), summer (June, July, and August), fall (September, October, and November), and winter (December, January, and February). Meanwhile, because this classification may not be very accurate to distinguish seasonal effects on API due to a large land area of China (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), we examined and presented the patterns of API by temperatures and weeks using three-dimensional technology. To examine regional difference, we classified six regions using a standard method that is commonly applied in China (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). The six regions are as follows: North China (15 cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, and cities from Hebei, Shanxi, and Inner Mongolia provinces), Northeast China (12 cities from Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces), East China (35 cities, including Shanghai, and cities from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Shandong provinces), South China (30 cities from Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces), Southwest China (15 cities, including Chongqing, and cities from Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Tibet provinces), and Northwest China (13 cities from Shanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and Xinjiang provinces).
