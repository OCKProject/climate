<p class="p">Finally, by considering a possible time-lag effect between exposure and health outcomes, we conducted a set of sensitivity analyses to examine the association between annual average air quality measured in early years (2002–2010) and total mortality in late years (2012 and 2013) (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). The analysis included (1) testing the association between air quality in 2003 and 2004 and total mortality in 2012 and 2013 (i.e., assuming a 10-year time-lag effect between exposure and total mortality), (2) testing the association between air quality in 2008 and 2009 and total mortality in 2012 and 2013 (i.e., a 5-year time-lag effect between exposure and total mortality), and (3) repeating the analysis by applying a 4-year annual average estimate of air quality in 2002–2005, and in 2007–2010 to test the associations between air quality and total mortality (i.e., assuming a 5- and 10-year time-lag effect). This method by calculating annual average values of air quality measured in multiple years allowed us to increase the sample size, because some cities they had at least 2 years measures during this time period can be included. Furthermore, we assumed that a 4-year (or at least 2-year) average estimate was more reliable than that would be found for a single year (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>). The biological rationale is that chronic disease develops over a long period of time, typically for years, during which distinct biological events need to take place, and that the relevant etiologic agents may have an impact on one or more “steps” in this process. It is, therefore, important to account for an adequate interval of time between exposure and outcome (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>). In our study, we tested whether a 5-year and/or 10-year time-lag effects of API on total mortality exist on the basis of the available datasets.
