<p class="p">In the second group analysis, spatial patterns of mean API by geographic and three time periods (years) were described using Arc Geographic Information System – Ring map technology (GIS Version 12, Redlands, CA, USA) (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). In the analysis, 120 cities had API measures in both 2012 and 2013, and 80 cities had API measures in 2007–2010, 2012, and 2013. Because the number of cities with API measures were limited by years before 2013, we calculated the annual average API of 2007–2010 (i.e., a city that had at least two annual API measures during 2007–2010 is included in the analysis) in order to increase the number of cities that can be used to test an overall trend of API from 2007–2010 to 2013. It should be also noticed that only 49 matching cities that had both measures of API and climate factors in 2012 and 2013. Therefore, data analysis for the association between API and climate factors was conducted using data from the 49 cities.
