<p class="p">The impact of climate change on tick-borne diseases has long been a subject of debate (

 <xref rid="bib84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Randolph, 2010</xref>) and is still a controversial issue. While some models suggest dramatic range expansions of 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes</italic> ticks and tick-borne diseases as a result of climate warming, predicted distributions may also vary widely with the modelsâ€™ assumptions (
 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ostfeld and Brunner, 2015</xref>). It has been stated that the impact of global warming on tick-borne diseases will be more evident at the geographical limits of current distributions, where suboptimal temperatures are currently limiting the spread of infected vectors (

 <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ostfeld and Brunner (2015)</xref> argued that more data on key tick-demographic and climatic processes, as well as the incorporation of non-climatic processes are required to develop better models.
