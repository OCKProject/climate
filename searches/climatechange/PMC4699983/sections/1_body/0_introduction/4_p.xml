<p class="p">Climate change may impact human health and wellbeing in many ways, including by facilitating the spread of many infectious agents. For instance, the changing scenarios of major vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease) have been linked to several factors, including urbanization and deforestation, changing demographics in both developing and developed countries, economic crisis, increased global movement of people and animals, and climate change (

For instance, many blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks spend the bulk of their life cycle in the environment and their development, survival and population dynamics depend on many factors, including host availability, vegetation coverage, and climate (
