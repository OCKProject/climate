<p class="p">One may prognosticate that human development and climate change will negatively affect biodiversity at local to global scales. Accordingly, there is now weighty evidence that decreases in biodiversity increase risk of transmission of different infectious diseases (

 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zargar et al. (2015)</xref> highlighted that the biodiversity-disease relationship is a multifactorial process and suggested the use of a multidimensional approach, whereby the same disease system could be studied in different ecological zones. New databases (e.g., PREDICTS and BIOFRAG databases) are being made available and will be useful for future assessments on terrestrial biodiversity responses to human impacts (
