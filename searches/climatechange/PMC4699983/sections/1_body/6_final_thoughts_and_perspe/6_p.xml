<p class="p">Strong commitment of scientists and professionals from different disciplines (e.g., medicine, veterinary, parasitology, biology, ecology, epidemiology, statistics, geography, physics, mathematics, and anthropology) will be needed to address tick-borne diseases from a broad perspective. It may be anticipated that warmer winters and extended autumn and spring seasons will continue to drive the expansion of the distribution of some tick species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic>) to northern latitudes and to higher altitudes. Livestock movements will also play a role in the latitudinal dispersion of ticks in some areas (

Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether and to what extent climate change will influence the upsurge of tick-borne diseases in new areas and/or their re-emergence in core endemic areas. Certainly, other factors such as urbanization, population growth, economic downturn, and political crisis (

 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Godfrey and Randolph, 2011</xref>) should also be considered while assessing this multifaceted problem. Furthermore, it is now more evident than ever that biodiversity loss may increase disease risk (see
