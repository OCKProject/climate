<p class="p">Human development is transforming most of Earth's natural systems, but the health impacts of ecosystem alteration are still poorly understood (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Myers etÂ al., 2013</xref>). Human behaviour is also a strong determinant of environmental health, animal health and human health. With regard to tick-borne diseases, changes in human behaviour may result in diverging outcomes in terms of transmission risk. Even if general conditions are favourable to transmission in a given region, the avoidance of tick-infested habitats by people could change the outcome of the transmission risk model. Likewise, even if a person bitten by a tick, the rapid removal of this tick may reduce the transmission risk to near zero.
