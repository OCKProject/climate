<p class="p">The future of the Earth's climate is uncertain in the long term. Hence, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and on tick-borne diseases at local to global scales is unpredictable. Some causes and consequences of climate may vary in space and time, sometimes being reversible. Can we slow down our unsustainable population growth through family planning? Can we reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by exploring alternative, renewable energy sources? Can we reforest and re-wild the world? Will this positively influence our existence on this planet?</p>
