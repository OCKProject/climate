<p class="p">Recent, long-term studies have demonstrated changes in the distribution of the castor bean tick 
 <italic class="italic">Ixodes ricinus</italic> in different parts of its range. For instance, data from a 30-year study conducted in Sweden indicated a clear expansion of the distribution range of this tick towards northern latitudes (
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jaenson et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the range of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> in Sweden increased by 9.9% during the observation period and most of expansion occurred in the north (north of 60°N) where the tick's coverage area doubled from 12.5% in the early 1990s to 26.8% in 2008. Another long-term study carried out from 1977 to 2011 in Russia reported an increase in the abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> in the eastern part of its range (
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Korotkov et al., 2015</xref>). These studies have shown that the northward spreading of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> in Sweden and Russia appear to be associated to climate change, particularly to the occurrence of milder winters and extended growing seasons. Host population dynamics, in response to climate change or due to human activities, may also have played a role in this process.
