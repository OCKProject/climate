  <title class="title">The big data of tick-borne diseases</title>
 </caption>
 <p class="p">The amount of knowledge of different aspects related to pathogens, hosts and vectors accumulated over the half past century is incalculable. Several molecular aspects involved in the vector-pathogen-host triad have been deciphered. But the more we know, the more we need to know. Let me make a point here. The relationship between climate and vectors, such as ticks and mosquitoes is relatively well known, right? The relationship between biodiversity loss and increased transmission risk of several infectious diseases is recognized, as well. However, all of this is just part of a much bigger picture that involves complex micro and macro-processes, starting from intimate interactions between pathogen, vectors and host molecules, and finishing in the whole Earth ecosystem. Imagine a single Lyme disease spirochete 
  <italic class="italic">Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (with its genome, transcriptome and proteome). Then, imagine a blacklegged tick 
  <italic class="italic">Ixodes scapularis</italic> (with its genome, transcriptome and proteome) that is infected by millions of 
  <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> spirochetes and other bacterial organisms. Now, consider a population of blacklegged ticks (different developmental stages, different feeding status, infection rates by different pathogens) in a forested area and its host communities (e.g., mice, birds, deer, foxes, wolves, lizards) with varying susceptibility to 
  <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic>. Imagine the whole forest ecosystem and relevant ecological processes going on (e.g., trophic cascades). Add human pressure (e.g., deforestation, fruit harvesting, hunting, road construction, land use). Imagine that this forest belong to a municipality. Consider the whole infrastructure (e.g., roads, cars, power stations, transmission networks, houses, schools, hospitals) and features of the human population (e.g., culture, education, work activities, socioeconomic conditions, public health policy). Considering all this together (and perhaps other aspects that we may be less aware at present) and their possible dynamical interactions, a complete understanding of all aspects involved in the transmission dynamics of tick-borne pathogens is possibly beyond current human capabilities. Additional knowledge on ticks, animals, pathogens and their interactions with the whole ecosystem will be needed and, perhaps, new developments in the field of bioinformatics to analyse simultaneously such a big amount data in a comprehensive way.
