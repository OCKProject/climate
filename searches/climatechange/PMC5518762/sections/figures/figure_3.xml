  <p class="p">Change in overlap of areas climatically suitable to 34 alien garden plants and their 173 congeners in the native and naturalized flora of Europe. Overlap in areas is measured by the log of the ratio of the number of 10 × 10′ cells suitable to both species in a possible species pair. Each point represents the average change in overlap between one of the 34 garden plants and all its congeners under the respective climate scenario (some points represent more than one pair because of identical values). Values &lt;0 represent a decrease, values &gt;0 an increase, values = 0 no change in overlap. The three panels refer to climate change scenarios
