<p class="p">Looking at climatically suitable ranges of the 34 garden plant species and their 173 congeners separately indicates that these results are partly driven by opposite effects of climate change on the two species groups: while average range size (=number of suitable cells) is projected to increase for the garden plants (statistically significantly only for scenario RCP8.5, see Table 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>), it will remain constant or even decrease for their congeners in the wild European flora, at least under the more severe scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, FigureÂ
