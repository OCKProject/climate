<p class="p">True skill statistic scores suggest that the mean geographical overlap between the climatically suitable ranges of the 34 garden plants and their congeners will decrease under a warming climate (Figure 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a): the overlap is lowest under the strongest scenario (RCP8.5) and also significantly different from current climatic conditions under the mild and intermediate scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP4.5; see Table 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4</xref>). When overlap is measured as the number of 10′ × 10′ cells that are climatically suitable to both the garden plants and their congeners (i.e., the absolute size of their overlapping range, see Table 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5</xref>), the results suggest that a warmer climate will not change the size of overlapping ranges in a statistically significant way in any of the scenarios (Figure
