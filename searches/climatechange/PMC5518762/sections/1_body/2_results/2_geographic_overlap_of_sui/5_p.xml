<p class="p">These average trends mask strong differences among genera. Figure 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> demonstrates that the number of cells climatically suitable to both the 34 garden plants and their European congeners can either strongly decrease or increase under each of the future climate scenarios, and variation among individual species pairs (i.e., a particular garden plant species with all its individual congener species) is even more pronounced. In particular, under each of the scenarios, there are a number of genera for which spatial overlap of suitable ranges between non‐native ornamental plants and their European congeners will increase markedly. This is especially true for the genera
