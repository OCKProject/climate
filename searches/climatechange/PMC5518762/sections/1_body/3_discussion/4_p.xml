<p class="p">We emphasize that our estimate of changing range overlaps does not include a temporal dimension. Real changes in overlap of species distribution over the 21st century may actually deviate from those projected here. On the one hand, wild populations of species (both native and naturalized) will likely lag behind the changing climate due to dispersal and migration constraints (e.g., Corlett &amp; Westcott, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Dullinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). These constraints are less relevant or even irrelevant for ornamental plants in horticultural trade. Actually, garden plants may even “overtake” climate change when regional demand of gardeners anticipates future climatic alterations (Bradley et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). On the other hand, remnant populations of species in the wild may still occupy an area long after the average climate has become unsuitable to them (Eriksson, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Actual range overlap over the next decades will hence not only be a function of changes in suitable ranges, but will be co‐determined by the behaviour of gardeners and by migration lags and extinction debts of wild populations (Dullinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Thus, we may expect that our SDM‐based projections will underestimate real overlap near the wild species' trailing edges (because of delayed extinctions), but overestimate it near the wild species' leading edges (because of lagged migration).
