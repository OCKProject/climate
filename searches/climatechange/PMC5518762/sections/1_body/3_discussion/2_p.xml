<p class="p">Taken together, our results do not support the expectation that the area suitable to both the group of potential future invaders among European garden plants and their congeners in the resident flora of the continent will increase under a changing climate. Potential range overlap between these two groups of species will rather decrease under all warming scenarios. This is partly due to opposing trends in the size of climatically suitable ranges among the two groups: while potential invaders on average expand their suitable ranges, those of resident congeners remain constant or shrink, at least under moderate and severe warming. However, there is pronounced variation among the different species pairs and for some of them the predicted increase in range overlap is significant, suggesting that the risk of hybridization between them will also increase.</p>
