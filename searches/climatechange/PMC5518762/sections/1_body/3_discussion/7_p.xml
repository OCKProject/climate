<p class="p">Apart from potentially fostering invasiveness, hybridization between alien and native plants may threaten native populations of rare species through outbreeding depression (Bleeker et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), gene swamping (Todesco et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) or pollen competition (Arceo‐Gomez &amp; Ashman, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Among the genera included in this study, introgressive hybridization has been documented in several cases (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic> (Gaskin &amp; Kazmer, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron</italic> (Stace et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), 
 <italic class="italic">Viola</italic> (Stace et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>)). Conversely, Bleeker et al. (
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) have identified 18 native species red‐listed in Germany, which potentially suffer from outbreeding depression when hybridizing with more abundant aliens. Among the 13 genera these species belong to, six are also included in our study (
 <italic class="italic">Euphorbia</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Malus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Populus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Prunus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Solidago</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Viola</italic>) with two of them (
 <italic class="italic">Solidago</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Prunus</italic>) tending towards increased range overlap with native congeners under a warming climate (these results are very similar when the climatic area of natives that is also suitable to their non‐native congeners among garden plants is calculated as a measure of threat to the native plants, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). In addition, Bleeker et al. (
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) listed threatened native 
 <italic class="italic">Viola</italic> spp. as sensitive to gene introgression from alien congeners. Similar evaluations for other European countries are largely lacking. However, across Europe, the congeners of our 34 potential future invaders include many regionally endangered or even globally rare species such as Mediterranean endemics in the genera 
 <italic class="italic">Linaria</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Senecio</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Viola</italic>. Although the magnitude of threat to rare species from outbreeding depression and introgression with hybridizing aliens is not well documented yet (Bohling, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), future escape and expansion of ornamental plants into the range of these endemics may actually put additional pressure on them, beyond the challenges they face under a warming climate. Most of these species are not included in our study as their distribution is not represented well enough in GBIF, but this issue certainly warrants further investigation.
