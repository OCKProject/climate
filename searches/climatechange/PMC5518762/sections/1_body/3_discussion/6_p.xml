<p class="p">Although we consider the change in suitable range overlap to be a sensible indicator of changing hybridization risk, the emergence of hybrids does not necessarily depend on the contact of the species in the wild. Some of the native or already naturalized congeners in our study are species that frequently occur at ruderal sites or even as garden weeds (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Euphorbia peplus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Senecio vulgaris</italic>) and hence also potentially reproduce with plants cultivated in gardens or parks. For these species, changing hybridization risk might more realistically be estimated from how their future suitable ranges overlap with the possible area where potential hybridization partners among ornamental plants can be cultivated when climate warms. These areas are usually much larger than those suitable for establishment of wild populations (Van der Veken etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and hence risk assessments based on the latter may actually be underestimates.
