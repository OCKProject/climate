<p class="p">Finally, as a last caveat, we note that the models this study is based on were fitted using data taken from GBIF. This source combines the advantage of a global coverage, and hence the possibility to fit niches of species comprehensively, with the disadvantage of the errors and biases implicit to this database (Meyer, Weigelt, &amp; Kreft, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Uncertainties in species distribution estimates and models resulting from these caveats have a clear geographical bias and are least pronounced in the well represented regions of Europe, North‐ and Central America, and Australia (Meyer et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The majority of the ornamental plants and all congeners modelled here come from these areas, and we hence assume that data problems are of limited importance for them. Several of the ornamental plants are native to temperate Asia and Africa, however, and these regions have notoriously low data coverage. The most likely consequence of this low coverage is an underestimate of these species' niches and hence of their potential distribution in Europe as well as their overlap with native and already naturalized congeners. Such underestimation may have been reinforced by the restrictive rules of our consensus projections. As a result, range overlap estimates computed here are probably conservative. We do not, however, think that these data problems affect our main result, namely that the average potential range overlap between ornamental plants and congeners does not increase under a warming climate. This is because predicted trends for species of Asian and African origin are similar to those of the remaining species (see Fig.

 <xref rid="ddi12578-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref> respectively).
