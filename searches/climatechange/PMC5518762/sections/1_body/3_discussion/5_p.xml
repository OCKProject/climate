<p class="p">An average decrease in range overlap among all the species pairs tested here does not necessarily imply a general decrease in hybridization risk from invasive plants in Europe. First, we deliberately restricted our approach to hybridization among potential future invaders and resident species but did not consider the possible emergence of hybrids within the resident (i.e., native and already naturalized or even invasive) species. Among the latter, several hybrids come from genera well‐known to hybridize such as 
 <italic class="italic">Fallopia</italic> (Parepa, Fischer, Krebs, &amp; Bossdorf, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) or 
 <italic class="italic">Epilobium</italic> (Gregor et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For an exhaustive evaluation of climate‐driven changes in hybridization risk of non‐native plants, these species would have to be included into the models. Second, the probability of hybridization risk will likely vary widely among the species pairs included in this study. Successful establishment of allopolyploid hybrids, for example, depends on plant traits (Mallet, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In addition, the genetic distance between species certainly differs a lot among the pairs studied and hence also the likelihood that reproductive barriers break down (Mallet, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). A more precise evaluation of hybridization risk under climate warming would therefore have to weight changing range overlaps by the likelihood that particular species pairs hybridize at all—and, in an additional step, by the probability that a particularly successful invader emerges from such hybridization (e.g., Abbott et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Hovick &amp; Whitney, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Such weighting might significantly modify expected changes in hybridization as individual species pairs with increasing range overlap are to be found in almost all genera. Although data for reliable estimation of these weights are lacking, we emphasize that among the genera with increasing average range overlaps in at least some scenarios, species in 
 <italic class="italic">Solidago</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron</italic> have already produced invasive hybrids in Europe (Abbott et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Erfmeier, Tsaliki, Ross, &amp; Bruelheide, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Karpaviciene &amp; Radusiene, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and may hence be particularly likely to do so in the future again. In addition, among the genera which were both identified to have produced invasive hybrids in the meta‐analysis of Hovick and Whitney (
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and used in our study, three include species pairs with increasing average range overlaps in at least some climate change scenarios (
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ulmus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Viola</italic>) and only one solely contains pairs with decreasing average overlap (
 <italic class="italic">Tamarix</italic>).
