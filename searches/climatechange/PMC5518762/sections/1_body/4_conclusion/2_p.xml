<p class="p">Climate warming will potentially increase the area suitable for the naturalization of many non‐native ornamental plants in Europe (Dullinger et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), but the mean geographical overlap of climatic ranges between the selection of ornamentals and their native and naturalized congeners modelled here is unlikely to increase in the future. Thus, the average risk that garden plants and their wild congeners in the European flora will hybridize does not appear to rise when climate warms. We emphasize, however, that suitable range overlaps do increase for many individual congener pairs and that the pair‐specific likelihood of successful hybrid establishment is unknown. A decreasing average range overlap does not, therefore, preclude increasing invasion risk from hybrids between particular species pairs.
