<p class="p">The alien flora of a region consists, first, of plant species that have already become naturalized or invasive. In addition, there is an often much larger group of alien species that have been introduced to a region and are grown there but have not escaped from cultivation yet. The latter group of species forms a massive pool of potential future additions to the regional wild flora. In many regions, this pool is dominated by non‐native plants used for public and domestic gardening (Hulme et al.,

 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In Europe, for example, more than 16,000 species from more than 200 families are currently in cultivation for ornamental purposes, with many of them being alien to Europe (Cullen, Knees, &amp; Cubey, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Some of these non‐native garden plant species have already become naturalized or invasive elsewhere in the world (van Kleunen et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and can hence be considered particularly likely to do so in Europe too (Williamson,
