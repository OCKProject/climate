<p class="p">Biological invasions are an important component of global environmental change and may have severe ecological as well as economic impacts (Bellard, Cassey, &amp; Blackburn,

 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Owing to intensified trade and traffic, the global redistribution of species and their subsequent establishment outside their native range (=their naturalization) have considerably increased during the recent decades and are likely to further increase in the future (Seebens et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Pro‐active management of such invasions is, however, hampered by the difficulty of predicting which species may become invasive and where. Such predictions are difficult because of the complex causes of invasions, which include biological traits of the invading species, biotic and abiotic characteristics of the recipient environment, and historical contingencies (Catford, Jansson, &amp; Nilsson, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Richardson &amp; Pyšek, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). There are, however, a number of factors known to facilitate invasions such as early reproduction, rapid growth rate, efficient long‐distance dispersal or specific trait profiles which are complementary to those of the resident biota (Buhk &amp; Thielsch,
