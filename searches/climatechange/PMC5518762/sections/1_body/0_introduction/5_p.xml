<p class="p">Disregarding deliberate crossings (e.g., for horticultural reasons), the risk of hybridization between introduced and resident species will depend on the introduced species' ability to naturalize, that is to establish self‐sustaining populations in the wild, because naturalization intensifies the spatial contact of the newcomers with their potential hybridization partners in the regional flora and hence increases mating opportunities. The likelihood of naturalization of an introduced species is mainly determined by propagule pressure (Simberloff, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) and the suitability of abiotic and biotic conditions (Pyšek et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Shea &amp; Chesson, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Among the abiotic factors, climatic suitability has been repeatedly shown to play a prominent role (e.g., Feng et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Hayes &amp; Barry, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Thuiller et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). As a corollary, predicted climate change is also likely to alter the naturalization odds of introduced alien species and thus the likelihood that they hybridize with resident species (e.g., Bellard et al.,
