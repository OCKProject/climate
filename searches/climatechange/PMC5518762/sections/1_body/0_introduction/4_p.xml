<p class="p">As species are transported around the world with increasing intensity, barriers to gene flow between once geographically separated species are reduced and new hybrids between introduced and resident species will probably emerge more frequently (Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For the British Isles, a recent overview has already demonstrated a rise in the number of hybrids during the last few decades (Stace, Preston, &amp; Pearman, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Apart from the risk that the new hybrids include particularly successful future invaders, rising hybridization rates also raise conservation concerns (Bohling, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In particular, genetic introgression and outbreeding depression may severely threaten native species (Todesco etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), especially those that are rare and only exist in small populations (Bleeker, Schmitz, &amp; Ristow, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
