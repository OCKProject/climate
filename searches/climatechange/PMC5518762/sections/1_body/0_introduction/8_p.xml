<p class="p">Here, we evaluated whether climate change may lead to an increase in this spatial overlap. We studied a group of 783 alien ornamental plants not yet naturalized in Europe, but established outside their native range elsewhere in the world, as identified in Dullinger et al. (
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). From this group of 783 species, we first selected all those belonging to genera with hybridization documented in the literature. We then fitted species distribution models for this subset of non‐native ornamentals as well as for all their congeners in the native and naturalized European flora. We restricted our analysis to congeners because hybridization risk is strongly linked to genetic distance (Mallet, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), and intergeneric hybrids are rare (Whitney, Ahern, Campbell, Albert, &amp; King, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Finally, we assessed to what extent the range matching between the selected garden plants and their congeners will increase under three different climate change scenarios.
