<p class="p">In a recent paper, Dullinger et al. (
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) showed that this latter group of “alien garden plants naturalized elsewhere” will benefit from a changing climate in Europe in as much as the area climatically suitable to them will increase. Given that climatic suitability is an important prerequisite to alien species' naturalization and that naturalization facilitates hybridization of introduced and resident species, the risk that new hybrids emerge may thus also be expected to increase in the future. The newly establishing garden plants may thereby hybridize with resident (i.e., native and already naturalized or even invasive) species (e.g., Ayres, Smith, Zaremba, Klohr, &amp; Strong,

However, a climate‐driven modification of regional hybridization risk does not only depend on the naturalization odds of garden plants, but also on changes in climatically suitable ranges of their potential hybridization partners (Dehnen‐Schmutz, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In other words, the changing spatial overlap in areas climatically suitable for alien garden plants and for their potential resident hybridization partners in the wild (both native and naturalized) flora will determine possible changes in the risk of hybridization between these two groups.
