<p class="p">Geographic overlap between the climatically suitable ranges of the 34 alien garden plants and their 173 congeners under current and future climatic conditions was quantified by calculating the TSS from binary projections. Further, range overlap was quantified by the total number of overlapping grid cells, again based on binary projections. Both metrics were calculated for each possible species pair; that is, each of the 34 garden plants was combined with any of its congeners. Overlap metrics were subsequently averaged per species of garden plant (i.e., the average range overlap of each garden plant species and all its congeners in the wild flora was computed), separately for each climate change scenario. These average overlaps were then compared among the current climate and each climate change scenario using linear mixed‐effects models (LMMs). Each LMM used the 34 ratios of current‐to‐future climatic range overlaps as the response, which was regressed against a fixed intercept, that is we tested whether the mean of the logarithm of these ratios was significantly larger or smaller than 0. A random intercept for genus was estimated to account for the fact that some genera were represented by more than one species of garden plant.</p>
