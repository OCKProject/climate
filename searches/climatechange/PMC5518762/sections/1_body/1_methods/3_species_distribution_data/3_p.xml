<p class="p">For characterizing the means and annual variability of the current temperature and precipitation patterns, we used six bioclimatic variables (climatic data averaged for the baseline period 1950–2000) provided by WorldClim (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>): BIO4—Temperature Seasonality, BIO5—Max Temperature of Warmest Month, BIO6—Min Temperature of Coldest Month, BIO16—Precipitation of Wettest Quarter, BIO17—Precipitation of Driest Quarter, BIO18—Precipitation of Warmest Quarter. All these variables are known to potentially influence species distributions (Root et al., 
 <xref rid="ddi12578-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). All climatic variables were provided by
