<p id="Par21" class="p">The projected premature mortality burden in India may change if air pollution mitigation measures are  implemented in future. We perform a sensitivity (referred to as SA4, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) analysis to quantify averted premature mortality in such case. There are various possible pathways for policy implementation in the future that are difficult to foresee. We assume that air pollution mitigation policies will be enforced over the entire Indian landmass that would result in a reduction of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure such that the all India average PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure in the respective decades meets World Health Organization (WHO) interim target (IT)-1, 2 and 3 standards in near future, far future and distant future, respectively. If average ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure in India meets WHO IT-1 (i.e., 35 µg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) by 2031–2040, about 28,000–38,000 premature deaths can be averted under the RCP4.5 scenario and 41,100–60,100 under the RCP8.5 scenario every year across all the projected populations. Similarly if mitigation policies are further enforced such that average exposure to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> in India meets WHO IT-2 (25 µg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) by 2061–2070, 20,800–51,900 premature deaths can be averted under the RCP4.5 scenario and about 64,900–170,500 under the RCP8.5 scenario every year. We further assume that if all India average PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure meets WHO IT-3 (15 µg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) in the last decade of century with implementation of stringent measures, every year 30,800–145,800 lives can be saved under the RCP4.5 scenario and 66,000–308,500 under the RCP8.5 scenario. Achieving these targets may be difficult given the existing high level of ambient PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure (about twice or more than the Indian annual standard) in the Indo-Gangetic Basin. Even if India does not meet these targets by the specified years, any progress towards achieving these targets will have substantial health benefits.
