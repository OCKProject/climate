<p id="Par15" class="p">The key observations are summarized as follows. Premature mortality is expected to decrease in future decades compared to the baseline period. The highest premature mortality burden is expected for the SSP3–RCP8.5 combined scenario in all the decades, whereas lowest premature mortality is expected for the SSP5–RCP4.5 combined scenario. Premature mortality burden is expected to be 2.4–4, 9.7–17.9 and 28.5–38.8% higher under RCP8.5 scenario relative to RCP4.5 scenario in near future, distant future and far future, respectively. Across all the five population distributions following SSP scenarios, annual mean ( ± 1
