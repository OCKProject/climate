<p id="Par24" class="p">One option for national policy could be to follow SA4 (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) so that India achieves WHO IT-1, 2 and 3 in the near, distant and far future, respectively. It is important to note that, if India and rest of the world follow the RCP8.5 scenario, more stringent policy measures are required (relative to RCP4.5) to meet the targets discussed in SA4 including strong control of household sources. Any other pathways to meet air quality targets may modulate the projected burden differently in future. Although the relationship between climate change and air pollution is not a simple one, the country needs to take strong actions to reduce both kinds of impacts if health risks are to be tempered. If climate changes at a faster pace, it is even more important to reduce emission if the public’s health is to be protected.
