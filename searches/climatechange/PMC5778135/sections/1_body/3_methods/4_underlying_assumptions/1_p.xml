 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure is projected till the end of the century as discussed above based on the following underlying assumptions. First, the country-level age-specific fraction of population obtained from

Second, the present day GDP baseline mortality non-linear relation in India is assumed to hold true for future as well. Third, we consider that the IERs used to estimate RR holds true in the future decades. RR in the IERs depends only on the PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> mass concentration, not on the composition. Some recent studies have highlighted that RR for cardiovascular diseases due to PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure dominated by biomass burning might not be the same as of PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> dominated by fossil-fuel combustion

 </sup>. The IERs may be updated in future with inclusion of new cohort studies. Finally, we have not used emissions projected by the SSP scenarios to estimate future PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure. Our estimated PM
 <sub class="sub">2.5</sub> exposure is driven by RCP scenarios only. We also have not considered air pollution control policies suggested in SSP scenarios
