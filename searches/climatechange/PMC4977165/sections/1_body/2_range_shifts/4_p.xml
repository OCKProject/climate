<p class="p">Another shortfall of current bioclimatic envelope models is that they do not account for non-climatic influences on species’ distributions, such as terrain and biotic interactions (but see ref. 
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>). Climate-induced species interactions are likely to have important consequences for future species distributions.
