<p class="p">We and others believe, however, that the major limitation of predictions derived from bioclimatic envelope models is the assumption that species lack sufficient phenotypic plasticity to adjust to climates beyond those in which they occur currently.

 </xref> Models typically assume, for each species, that the realized niche is the fundamental niche: the species occupies today all habitats fulfilling the thermal conditions that it can tolerate, and it therefore cannot survive at a current habitat if conditions depart from those in which that species survives now. Yet, plasticity may allow animals to adjust to changing climatic conditions without changing their location. Some bioclimatic envelope models have attempted to incorporate physiological factors to address the climatic tolerances of terrestrial ectotherms

Although these physiologically-tuned models still have limitations, for example in not taking non-climatic factors into account, they are likely to be more robust than those bioclimatic envelope models that are based only on correlations between observed distributions and current climate variables.
