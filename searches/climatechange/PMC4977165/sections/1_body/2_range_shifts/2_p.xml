<p class="p">Shifting range in response to climate change requires suitable new habitats to be accessible, and for the required traveling distances to be within the capacity of the species that is shifting range. The rapid rate of climate change will mean that nearly 10% of mammals in the western hemisphere will be unable to move fast enough to keep pace with projected climate changes.

In circumstances in which natural range shifts are not feasible, either as a result of unattainable traveling distances or loss of habitat connectivity, assisted colonization may provide a conservation option.

 </xref> Yet, moving species to areas where they do not currently occur is not without risk. The introduced species can carry disease, displace native species and thereby challenge ecosystem stability or alter the genetic structure of local populations. An in-depth knowledge of species’ biology and accurate climate change predictions is required before assisted colonization can become a routine conservation option.
