<p class="p">Although large mammals in fragmented, human-dominated habitats, like those prevailing in South Africa, will be precluded from shifting to a new habitat in response to current climate change, large mammals in more-pristine habitats such as bears in northern Canada, and smaller mammals everywhere, may be able to track suitable climates. In the temperate zone, for example, a 1 Â°C increase in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of ~160 km in latitude or 160 m in elevation.
