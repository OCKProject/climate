 </xref> First, they may shift their distribution range, to habitats where the climate is within the species’ tolerance limits. Second, they may remain in a location but adjust to new climatic regimes either through a change in the genetic composition of a population or by phenotypic plasticity, which results in a different phenotype from an existing genotype via changes in epigenetic control of gene expression.

 </xref> Either of these outcomes may bring about changes in the timing of events (phenology), anatomical variation (e.g., color patterns, body shape and size), or changes in the behavior or physiology of a species, which could reduce the impact of climate change.
