<p class="p">For many large mammals, especially those living in human-dominated landscapes, range shifts are unlikely options for coping with climate change. Because the research has not been done, we do not know whether large mammals can express sufficient genetic shifts or phenotypic plasticity to adjust to the current climate change event. We do know that large mammals are more likely to be adversely effected by climate change than their smaller counterparts.
