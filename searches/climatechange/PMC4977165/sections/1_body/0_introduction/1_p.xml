<p class="p">The 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change synthesis report predicts an increase in global temperatures of between 1.5 °C and 4.5 °C during the 21st Century,

Although the rate of the current warming episode probably does not exceed the normal background rate of climate change, continued warming over the next few decades will exceed the background rate of change by more than an order of magnitude.

 </xref> Though worse is to come, it is delusional to envisage climate change only as a future challenge. Its biological consequences already are evident. Of the nearly 30 000 documented trends in physical systems and biological characteristics of plants and animals between 1970 and 2004, 90% have been in the direction consistent with environmental temperature increases.
