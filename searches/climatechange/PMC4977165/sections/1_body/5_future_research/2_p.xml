 </xref> Physiological variables such as body temperature, activity and energetic expenditure of terrestrial mammals now can be measured relatively easily in free-living animals. We need to make such sophisticated physiological measurements in individuals of several species inhabiting a variety of environments, measurements that would fall into the recently-defined field of macrophysiology, defined as “the investigation of variation in physiological traits over large geographical and temporal scales and the ecological implications of this variation”

 </xref>. Incorporating the resulting macrophysiological data into bioclimatic envelope models will allow us to better predict how species will respond to climate change. Knowing which species demonstrate sufficient physiological plasticity to cope with the consequences of climate change will allow for more informed decisions as to which species are particularly vulnerable to climate change.
