<p class="p">In the face of climate change, large mammals will depend largely on their physiological phenotypic plasticity to survive, but there have been few appropriate studies of the physiological responses of free-living terrestrial mammals in their natural habitats. Performing such studies, in which they measure the effects of thermal stress and reduced water and food availability on behavioral patterns and physiological responses, is the main research focus of the authors. They have developed innovative techniques for long-term remote measurement of body temperature, locomotor activity, drinking patterns, thermoregulatory behavior and local microclimate around an animal, which they are using to investigate how free-living mammals, ranging in size from monkeys to elephants, respond to climate and habitat changes (
