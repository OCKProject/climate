<p class="p">Among the large terrestrial mammals seemingly destined to become extinct are the charismatic species so important for ecotourism. Africa is rich in such species, and serves as an example of the future likely under climate change; 25–40% of a representative sample of 277 of its mammalian species is likely to be critically endangered or extinct by 2080.

 </xref> The charismatic species of South Africa are likely to be particularly vulnerable to climate change, as will be large mammals in human-dominated landscapes elsewhere, because the consequences of high human population density will prevent their dispersal. The extinction risk of South African mammals is estimated to be as high as 69% by 2050.
