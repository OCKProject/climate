<p class="p">Global warming has been a common occurrence on Earth for the last 3.5 billion years. Modeling of the current episode predicts a temperature rise of the same order of magnitude as that evident at the end of the Permian, when mass volcanism increased global temperatures by 6 Â°C and resulted in the extinction of nearly 95% of species.

 </xref> We cannot be sure that it was the warming that was responsible for all of those extinctions, but the fossil record is unequivocal that extinction and extirpation have been common outcomes for species facing past climate change events of comparable magnitude.

 </xref> predicted that, under mid-range climate change scenarios, a quarter of terrestrial plants and animals may be extinct by 2050. By extrapolating such predictions to a global scale, the authors predicted that well over one million species, among which will be many large terrestrial mammal species, could be threatened with extinction as a result of climate change. Their models predict that 45% of terrestrial species are likely to be committed to extinction by 2050 if their dispersal is limited.
