 </xref> Mammals possessing a carotid rete employ selective brain cooling that reduces hypothalamic temperature. Because hypothalamic temperature provides the main drive for evaporative heat loss, the hypothalamic cooling conserves water by transferring heat loss to non-evaporative means.

 </xref> The evolution of the carotid rete is proposed to have promoted thermoregulatory flexibility and thus facilitated the invasion of arid zones by artiodactyls, which have a carotid rete, during the highly-seasonal post-Eocene period.
