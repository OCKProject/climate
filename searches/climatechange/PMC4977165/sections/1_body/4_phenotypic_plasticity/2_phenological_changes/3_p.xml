<p class="p">One possible cause of mismatch between phenological responses in connected species is the different environmental cues to which different species respond.

 </xref> Whereas most plants and insects respond to seasonal changes in temperature, most vertebrate species are more sensitive to changes in photoperiod, although, as was the case for red deer on Rum, better nutrition can also advance reproductive events.

 </xref> Thus, those vertebrates with a photoperiod-sensitive reproductive cycle that remain at their historic locations may face a mismatch between reproduction and food availability, while those dispersing latitudinally will have to adjust to an unfamiliar annual cycle of photoperiod in their new habitat.

 </xref> Those species that are unable to match the timing of key life-history events to the phenology of the species on which they depend will be forced to show plasticity in other life-history traits if they are to maintain their lifetime reproductive success. For example, flexibility in phenology of the Antarctic fur seal (
 <italic class="italic">Arctocephalus gazelle</italic>) is important in their highly variable thermal environment but is limited because of the long interval between conception and weaning of the pups. As their environment warms the female Antarctic fur seals appear to be adapting their life cycles by not breeding in years of low krill supply, thus increasing adult survival and fitness.

 </xref> Another species that is changing its life-history strategy in response to stochastic environmental conditions is the pronghorn (
 <italic class="italic">Antilocapra americana</italic>). Frequent severe weather events result in an increase in male mortality, which favors precocial maturation in male pronghorn and may ultimately lead to a life-history strategy of faster development.

 </xref> Similarly, the Soay sheep mentioned above are also breeding at an earlier age as their climate warms, resulting in a general decrease in mean body size in that population.
