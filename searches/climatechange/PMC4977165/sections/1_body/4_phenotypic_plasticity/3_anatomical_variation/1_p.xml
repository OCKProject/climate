<p class="p">Although the majority of reports of phenotypic responses to climate change, adaptive or not, relate to phenology, there are reports relating to other traits. A decline in body mass is considered the third universal response (after phenology and range shifts) to warming associated with climate change.

 </xref> The relationship between body mass and thermoregulation is complex. Relative to animals of larger body mass, animals of the same shape with lower body mass, for geometric reasons, have a higher surface area-to-mass ratio, and therefore have more difficulty preventing body heat loss in cold environments. That physical relationship is congruent with Bergmann’s rule that predicts a positive correlation between the body mass of terrestrial endotherms and latitude, and, by inference, an inverse correlation between body mass and environmental temperature. With global warming, species with lower body mass would lose that disadvantage progressively, so a relative increase in proportion of smaller animals would be expected in a warmer world.

 </xref> There are some data supporting that expectation. As mentioned, over a 20-y period of progressive winter warming, the average body mass of the Soay sheep on St. Kilda has declined between ~0.3% (senescents) and ~0.8% (yearlings) of mean body mass per year. The proposed mechanism is that the milder winters resulted in less reliance on fat reserves, which in turn enables more of the small individuals to survive the winter.

 </xref> However, a decline in body mass does not appear to be a universal response of mammals to climate change. Data from museum specimens collected during the last quarter of the twentieth century reveal that body size of otters (
 <italic class="italic">Lutra lutra</italic>) in Norway has increased, presumably as a result of increased food availability.

 </xref> Indeed, only 7% of recently-observed changes in mammalian body masses provide support for an advantage to smaller mammals.

 </xref> Also, the physical principles outlined above have a reverse effect when ambient temperature exceeds body temperature, a situation which will become increasingly common with climate change. There the higher surface area-to-mass ratio increases environmental heat load. In those environments, thermal balance also will depend on the capacity for evaporative cooling, which may be unrelated to body mass. Despite a 4-fold difference in body mass between Arabian oryx (

 <italic class="italic">Gazella subgutturosa marica</italic>), both species showed an increased amplitude of body temperature rhythm (increased heterothermy) when they were exposed to the same extreme heat and aridity (
