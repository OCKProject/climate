Gathering physiological and behavioral data, on the other hand, is labor-intensive and requires long periods of observation and monitoring. Given that natural selection works primarily at the level of physiology and behavior,

 </xref> it is concerning that we understand so little, for all mammals, about the direct links between physiology and vulnerability to climate change. We need to improve our understanding of the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that determine an animalâ€™s thermal tolerance and its capacity for acclimatization in order to better predict the impact of climate change on a particular species.
