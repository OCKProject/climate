 </xref> The best known mechanisms of epigenetics are DNA methylation, histone modification, and more recently it has become obvious that small non-coding RNAâ€™s have both transcriptional effects on gene expression and post-transcriptional effects that alter the fate of the RNA from gene transcription, prior to translation into RNA.
