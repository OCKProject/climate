<p class="p">Our discussion of physiological acclimatization in response to climate change relates to how function in an individual might change, potentially to its benefit, as it encounters climate change. That encounter might affect not just the animal itself, but also its offspring, through the phenomenon known as “maternal effects”: the conditions to which a female animal is exposed during her pregnancy can influence the life-history traits in her offspring.

 </xref> These maternal effects involve epigenetic changes in the fetus and are controlled by hormones that regulate the expression of phenotypic variation in traits like body mass, growth and survival. Stress and reproductive hormone levels in free-living populations correlate with life-history traits and may provide useful biomarkers of how mammals might be adapting to climate change.
