<p class="p">Numerous species of antelope in the northern hemisphere display plasticity in offspring birth mass in response to changing climatic conditions.

 </xref> Although these maternal effects may promote the survival and enhance the reproductive success of the mother, such plasticity in birth mass has long-term consequences for the offspring. Like many morphological traits, body mass at birth is a “non-labile” trait as it is expressed only once in an individual’s lifetime.

 </xref> Most “non-labile” traits are traits that show plasticity only during development. However, such developmental plasticity can be adaptive only if the trends for changes in climatic conditions at the time of development remain similar throughout the offspring’s lifetimes.
