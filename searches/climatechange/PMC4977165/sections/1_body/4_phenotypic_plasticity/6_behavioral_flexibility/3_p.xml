<p class="p">The interplay between competing homeostatic processes will become increasingly important under the thermal threat of climate change, and optimization of homeostasis increasingly difficult. The moose (
 <italic class="italic">Alces alces</italic>) provides an example of the potential costs associated with behavioral thermoregulation of a large mammal in the context of climate change. In the past 20 y, the moose population in Minnesota, USA, has halved and the population in the Isle Royale National Park, USA, has declined by 75%. Moose are particularly sensitive to heat and seek shelter when ambient temperatures exceed 14 °C.

 </xref> Over the past 40 y, as the average summer temperature has increased by 2 °C, moose have forfeited valuable foraging time in preference for lethargy and microhabitat selection in the form of immersion in cool water. Forfeiting foraging has led to malnutrition and decreases fat reserves, which are essential for winter survival. Malnutrition also is likely to increase their risk of succumbing to parasites, disease and predation by wolves, all factors which are believed to have contributed to the recent decline in the moose population.
