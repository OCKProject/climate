<p class="p">Without a radical change in their behavior, the future survival of polar bears (
 <italic class="italic">Ursus maritimus</italic>) is considered bleak.

 </xref> Over the past 28 y the number of polar bears in Hudsonâ€™s Bay has decreased, and those that remain are in poor body condition.
 <xref rid="R176" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">176</sup>
 </xref> Polar bears are dependent heavily on Arctic spring ice, because that is where they discover the seals (on ice to give birth) that are their primary food source at this time.

  <sup class="sup">178</sup>
 </xref> The Arctic ice is disappearing under the impact of global warming, and, if polar bears continue with their current lifestyle, the world population is likely to drop by two-thirds by 2050.
 <xref rid="R179" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">179</sup>
 </xref> Polar bears may well survive if they have the capacity to make a major change in lifestyle (which the fossil record shows they have done previously), namely to abandon the ice, and their current food source, and to become land-based.
 <xref rid="R177" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">177</sup>
 </xref> Another species forced to change its behavior and become land-based is the Pacific walrus (
 <italic class="italic">Odobenus rosmarus divergens</italic>). Walruses use sea ice as a breeding ground, as well as a resting platform between foraging dives, but the recent decline in Arctic sea ice has forced them to abandon the sea ice and haul out instead along the shores of Alaska and Russia.
 <xref rid="R180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">180</sup>
 </xref> Coastal haul outs often are associated with mortalities from trampling, exhaustion and the separation of calves from their mothers.
 <xref rid="R181" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">181</sup>
 </xref> Furthermore, there may be energetic costs as walruses are forced to spend more time at sea traveling between coastal haul out sites and offshore foraging areas than when offshore sea ice is available.
 <xref rid="R180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">180</sup>
 </xref> Unlike the walruses, which have to travel more, some humpback whales (
 <italic class="italic">Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>) are abandoning their migration habits and remaining in southeast Alaska throughout winter, seemingly in response to climate-induced increased availability of herring.
 <xref rid="R182" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">182</sup>
 </xref> Presumably the energetic cost of thermoregulation in the cold waters is offset by metabolic savings of not having to undertake one of the longest documented mammalian migrations, with food locally available.
 <xref rid="R183" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">183</sup>
 </xref> The humpback whales will not be the only species for which migration patterns will be affected by climate change.
