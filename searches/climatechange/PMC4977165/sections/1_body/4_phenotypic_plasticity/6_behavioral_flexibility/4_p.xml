By increasing nocturnal activity, the usually-diurnal Arabian oryx was able to compensate completely when its diurnal activity was reduced as a result of shade-seeking in extreme daytime heat (

 </xref> The Arabian oryx were not prevented by natural predators from shifting freely between diurnal and nocturnal activity, but large mammals elsewhere will have an expensive trade-off to make because they may be exposed to a greater nocturnal predation pressure should they attempt to avoid high diurnal temperatures by becoming nocturnal. Nevertheless, species that show flexibility in their activity patterns are less likely to be affected adversely by climate change than are those species which are strictly diurnal, or even strictly nocturnal.
