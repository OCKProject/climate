<p class="p">A morphological feature related to climate tolerance that is determined genetically is an animal’s coat color. Analyses by Maloney et al.

 </xref> The advantage enjoyed historically by dark-colored sheep in absorbing solar radiation better would carry less benefit in warmer environments. Similarly, there is thermoregulatory significance of pelt color for springbok (

 </xref> Increased absorption of solar radiation, however, may disadvantage the black springbok in the heat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). As with the Soay sheep, we expect the black color morphs to decline as their habitats warm, if populations are left unmanaged.
