<p class="p">Although coat color has a genetic basis amenable to micro-evolution in populations of mixed color morphs, and numerous studies have interpreted such anatomical changes as micro-evolutionary responses to climate change, the majority of studies have provided no evidence that the observed changes have a genetic basis.
