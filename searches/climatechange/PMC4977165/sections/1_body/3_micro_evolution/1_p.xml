<p class="p">Future extinction risk is likely to be overestimated if species exhibit adaptive genotypic changes in response to environmental change. Evolutionary change often is considered too slow, given the rate of the climate change event, to allow genetic adaptation, but is likely to have accompanied range shifts in the past.

By mixing populations that are shifting, a range shift increases genetic variation, thereby increasing the population’s chance of adapting to changing conditions. Northwards range shifts in the northern hemisphere, for example, may have the advantage of introducing genotypes that are better adapted to warmer conditions, thus promoting the adaptation of existing cooler-adapted populations to climate change.

 </xref> Conversely, range shifts also can decrease genetic variability that has occurred historically as a result of outbreeding of distinct populations. For example, climate change may result in genetic mixing among subspecies of the black bear, which could inhibit or even reverse sub-speciation.
