The high magnitude of change in the species prevalence due to future changes in tropical climates within the tropical subregions, especially under high emissions scenario, lends credence to the proposition that, a little increase in temperature such as half degree centigrade increase can translate into a 30% to 100% increase in mosquito abundance [
