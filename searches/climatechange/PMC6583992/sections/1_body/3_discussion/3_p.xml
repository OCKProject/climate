 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> boundaries may occur southward and eastward of Africa rather than jumps into quite different climatic environments under climate change scenarios. The eastward shift, though tending more northward than southward is expected to be the case in Nigeria under both low and high emissions scenarios between 2041 and 2080. This does not overlook potential southward shift based on the north to south climate variation [
