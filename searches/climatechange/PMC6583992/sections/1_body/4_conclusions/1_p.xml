<p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change and land use dynamics are expected to increase the population and potential range of malaria vectors and exacerbate malaria burden. This study explored the effect of changing climate under low and high emissions scenarios on future composition and potential distribution of dominant malaria vector species in tropical subregions and administrative regions within the tropical country—Nigeria; using data of vectors known locations and environmental drivers of their occurrence and distribution, following algorithms defined in species distribution model—MaxEnt. Results show that

Humid forest and Derived savanna within all southern and most North Central states, with highest species invasion in Sahel and Sudan savannas, particularly in north-eastern states are likely to be most impacted. The predicted variability in species composition and distribution based on diversity in climate conditions in the tropical subregions across the country, may define the future spatial epidemiology of these vectors and possible malaria risk pattern. The impending high magnitude of change in prevalence of these dominant malaria vector species may lead to high malaria burden in 2050s, and higher in 2070s; especially under high emissions scenario, mostly dependent on past, current and future anthropogenic emissions and natural climate variability. Hence, there is need for more studies aimed at spatial estimation of future malaria prevalence at a finer scale with respect to vectors dynamics and distribution within the tropical subregions; and in relation to incremental differentials in climate and land use dynamics for the development of more robust adaptation strategies under global change.
