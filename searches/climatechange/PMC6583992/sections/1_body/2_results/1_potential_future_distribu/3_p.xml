<p class="p">The mean distribution density of 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> is projected to increase across all bioclimatic domains in the country by 4.43% in 2050s and 8.16% in 2070s under high emissions scenario, and by 2.03% and 2.72% under low emissions scenario, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). This projected increase may lead to large geographic expansion range and increased prevalence of 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> within ecological zones; Derived savanna (7.93% and 10.59% under RCP8.5) and (3.32% and 4.19% under RCP2.6), Humid forest (5.65% and 9.27% under RCP8.5) and (-0.68% and 1.13% under RCP2.6), Sudan savanna (7.02% and 10.44% under RCP8.5) and (6.22% and 6.59% under RCP2.6), Sahel savanna (11.84% and 13.99% under RCP8.5) and (8.01% and 8.52% under RCP2.6), and Southern Guinea savanna (3.57% and 7.86% under RCP8.5) and (1.56% and 1.69% under RCP2.6) in 2050s and 2070s, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). The probability of suitable areas for 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> in the less suitable Sahel and Sudan savannas is estimated to be high in 2050s, and higher in 2070s, especially under high emissions scenario (

 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> may likely go extinct in Kaduna South and parts of Kaduna North and Central within Northern Guinea savanna in 2050s, and shift towards north of Kaduna state, where environmental conditions may favour its occurrence around Kaduna boundary with Kano state in 2070s (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218523.s004" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). This species shift results in prevalence anomaly in Kaduna state under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Anomaly is also observed in Akwa Ibom, Ekiti, Kebbi and Rivers states under RCP8.5; and in Kano, Kebbi, Lagos and Ogun states under RCP2.6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Mid Altitude zone of Jos and Mambilla plateaus, and highlands along Cameron boundary are projected to experience more presences of 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> in 2050s under RCP8.5 with percentage increase of 1.87%, but record less presences in 2070s with percentage decrease of 1.78% (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218523.s004" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). Similarly, the 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> is projected to decrease in population within the Mid Altitude zone under RCP2.6 by 1.78% and 1.68% in 2050s and 2070s, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0218523.s004" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). The Fresh water and Mangrove swamp forests (within Humid forest) of the Niger Delta region are projected to remain less suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 in 2050s and 2070s Especially in Bayelsa state where environmental variables least favour the occurrence of 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). By regions, the model predicted that 
 <italic class="italic">An</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">arabiensis</italic> will continue its highest prevalence in South West, followed by South East, South South, North Central, North West; and lowest in North East (
