<p class="p">The mean distribution density of

 <italic class="italic">gambiae</italic> s.s. is projected to increase from current climates across all bioclimatic domains in the country by 10.48% and 14.49% in 2050s and 2070s under high emissions scenario, and by 5.03% and 5.95% under low emission scenario, respectively (

This is expected to lead to large geographic range expansion and increased prevalence (percentage increase) within Derived savanna (41.82% and 43.09% under RCP8.5) and (39.45% and 39.93% under RCP2.6), Humid forest (44.34% and 47.22% under RCP8.5) and (35.18% and 41.85% under RCP2.6), and mostly west of Sudan savanna (47.48% and 59.24% under RCP8.5) and (29.83% and 29.68% under RCP2.6) in 2050s and 2070s, respectively (

Observed anomaly is estimated to occur in Kaduna, Sokoto and Zamfara states under RCP8.5, just as it occurs in many other states under RCP2.6, either from higher distribution density under current climates than 2050s/2070s, or in 2050s than 2070s (Figs
