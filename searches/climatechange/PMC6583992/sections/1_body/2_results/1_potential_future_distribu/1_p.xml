This is expected to translate into large range expansions and high prevalence with increased distribution density within Humid forest (36.51% and 39.70% under RCP8.5) and (19.19% and 23.30% under RCP2.6), Derived savanna (48.60% and 52.26% under RCP8.5) and (43.69% and 43.03% under RCP2.6), Sudan savanna (37.66% and 44.31% under RCP8.5) and (28.02% and 26.66% under RCP2.6), and Sahel savanna (47.725 and 54.13% under RCP8.5) and (24.99% and 22.96% under RCP2.6) in 2050s and 2070s, respectively (
