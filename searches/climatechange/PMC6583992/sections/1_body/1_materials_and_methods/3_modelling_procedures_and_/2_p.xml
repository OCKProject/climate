<p class="p">The combined environmental variables predicted the probability of species occurrence by producing a point-wise mean (model images), created by MaxEnt model based on maximum entropy of optimal conditions of included environmental variables that match the threshold value within species occurrence records [

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. These images were classified in ArcMap for distributions of the studied mosquito species, and reclassified into suitable and unsuitable habitats using 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold provided by MaxEnt. Suitable habitat was defined to include 90% of the data used to develop the model, to take care of some errors inherent in the datasets [
