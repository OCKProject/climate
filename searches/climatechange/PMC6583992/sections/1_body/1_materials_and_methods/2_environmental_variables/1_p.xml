 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The bioclimatic variables were: annual mean temperature (bio1), mean diurnal range (bio2), isothermality (bio3), temperature seasonality (bio4), maximum temperature of warmest month (bio5), minimum temperature of coldest month (bio6), temperature annual range (bio7), mean temperature of wettest quarter (bio8), mean temperature of driest quarter (bio9), mean temperature of warmest quarter (bio10), mean temperature of coldest quarter (bio11), annual precipitation (bio12), precipitation of wettest month (bio13), precipitation of driest month (bio14), precipitation seasonality (coefficient of variation) (bio15), precipitation of wettest quarter (bio16), precipitation of driest quarter (bio17), precipitation of warmest quarter (bio18), and precipitation of coldest quarter (bio19). The climate data was based on three climate periods: the baseline time period 1960–1990 which observed data interpolations is referred to as current conditions [

It also serves as a stable benchmark against which changes in climate observations in 2041–2060 and 2061–2080 are compared [
