<p class="p">With nearly half of the world's population at risk in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], malaria continues as one of the highest killer infectious diseases in the world after lower respiratory tract infections, diarrhoeal diseases, human immunodeficiency virus / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) and tuberculosis, particularly among countries in the tropical region of the world [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. According to World malaria report 2018 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], an estimated 435,000 people died from malaria in 2017 from 219 million estimated global cases, with highest vulnerability among under-fives. Almost half of all global cases were accounted for by five tropical countries: Nigeria (25%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (11%), Mozambique (5%), India (4%) and Uganda (4%) [

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. With much efforts and considerable investments towards malaria control and eradication notwithstanding, some of the most plagued countries including Nigeria, India, Niger, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Myanmar, and Sudan (all within the tropical region), are reportedly below the operational universal coverage target of one insecticide treated nets (ITN) per two persons at malaria risk, together with lack of access to effective malaria treatment by large percentage of their population at risk, predominantly those living in rural remote settlements [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Malaria burden driven by poor vector control and inadequacy / inaccessibility of preventive material is expected to increase under changing world climates. Especially climate change resulting from the enhanced greenhouse effect [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] together with the direct effect of increased urbanisation / land use [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and population drivers, is expected to produce changes in species distribution including that of malaria vectors in tropical ecosystems [

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Shifts and increased prevalence induced by anthropogenic drivers [

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] on vectors distribution may exacerbate human exposure to malaria infection [
