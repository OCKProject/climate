<p class="p">The anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHG) emission which indirectly impact species distribution is expected to continue throughout the 21st century in the absence of climate change policy, giving rise to what is described as ‘high emission scenario’ under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) [

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Basically, there are four RCP scenarios describing GHGs emissions and concentrations up to 2100 based on radiative forcing levels associated with assumptions around different combinations of land use, economic, technological (energy), demographic, policy, and institutional futures [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Among two stabilisation scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP6), are one mitigation (low emissions) scenario (RCP2.6) and the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. RCP 2.6 assumes global annual GHG emissions peak by 2020 and decline substantially, as global population peaks mid-century, and the use of non-fossil fuel increases with high global economic growth, resulting in low GHG emissions in the presence of climate policy [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Both low and high emissions scenarios are expected to lead to noticeable variations in regional (and sub-regional) temperatures and precipitation, which may impel changes in geographic distributions of malaria vectors and malaria risk pattern [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Within the tropical region, temperature is projected to rise by 3–6°C under RCP8.5 in West Africa by the end of the 21st century, just as total precipitation will change slightly with longer rainy season accompanied by drier phases [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This is predicted to be more diverse within regions and subregions of West African countries, especially in Nigeria due to ecosystem diversity in its regional and ecological zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. A general decline in precipitation is predicted for Sudan, Sahel and Guinea savanna areas of North West, North East and North Central subregions, and a relatively large increase in precipitation in the coastal south [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], Humid Forest (within South South, South East and South West subregions), Derived savanna (within North Central, South east, South West and North East subregions), and highlands within Mid Altitude zone (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0218523.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> for the ecological and regional zones) [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Overall, temperature is projected to rise across the country by about 4.9°C with hotter nights and high humidity under RCP8.5 and limited to about 1.4°C under RCP2.6 on average from 1990 to 2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0218523.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The temperature in Humid Forest and Derived savanna under RCP8.5 is projected to increase by 3°C–4°C, and between 3°C and above 5°C in Guinea, Sudan and Sahel savannas in the north [
