 <p class="p">Temperature plays an important role in the growth and development of arthropods, and thus the current trend of climate change will alter their biology and species distribution. We used 
  <italic class="italic">Chaetodactylus krombeini</italic> (Acari: Chaetodactylidae), a cleptoparasitic mite associated with 
  <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae), as a model organism to investigate how temperature affects the development and voltinism of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> in the eastern United States. The effects of temperature on the stage-specific development of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> were determined at seven constant temperatures (16.1, 20.2, 24.1, 27.5, 30.0, 32.4 and 37.8째C). Parameters for stage-specific development, such as threshold temperatures and thermal constant, were determined by using empirical models. Results of this study showed that 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> eggs developed successfully to adult at all temperatures tested except 37.8째C. The nonlinear and linear empirical models were applied to describe quantitatively the relationship between temperature and development of each 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> stage. The nonlinear Lactin model estimated optimal temperatures as 31.4, 32.9, 32.6 and 32.5째C for egg, larva, nymph, and egg to adult, respectively. In the linear model, the lower threshold temperatures were estimated to be 9.9, 14.7, 13.0 and 12.4째C for egg, larva, nymph, and egg to adult, respectively. The thermal constant for each stage completion were 61.5, 28.1, 64.8 and 171.1 degree days for egg, larva, nymph, and egg to adult, respectively. Under the future climate scenarios, the number of generations (i.e., voltinism) would increase more likely by 1.5 to 2.0 times by the year of 2100 according to simulation. The findings herein firstly provided comprehensive data on thermal development of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> and implications for the management of 
  <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> populations under global warming were discussed.
