 <italic class="italic">Chaetodactylus krombeini</italic> was collected from the nests of the 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia cornifrons</italic> (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) colony on the West Virginia University Organic Farm in Morgantown, West Virginia (USA) with permission by the WVU Experiment Station. To establish laboratory colonies of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic>, adult mites were isolated from bee nests and transferred into wells of ELISA plates (E&amp;K Scientific, Santa Clara, CA) mimicking 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bee nests. Pollen provisions collected from the bee nests in the field were supplied into the wells as a food source for mites. The plates with mite colonies were kept in a 1,000-cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> cardboard box to provide darkness and kept under 20 ± 2°C and 60 ± 10% RH.
