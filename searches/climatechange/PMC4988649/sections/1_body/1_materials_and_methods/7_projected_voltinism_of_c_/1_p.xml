 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> found in this study and the future temperature data for 2006–2100 based on various RCP scenarios: RCP 8.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 4.5, and RCP 2.6. Daily minimum and maximum surface temperatures were obtained from the coupled simulations of the Community Earth System Model version 1 using the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CESM1-CAM5) [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] under the four RCP scenarios. Based on the simulated model outputs covering 192 (latitude) by 288 (longitude) grid cells (i.e., 0.9375° by 1.25°) for 2006–2100, daily mean temperature was calculated by averaging the daily minimum and maximum temperatures.
