<p class="p">Data at mid-range of the Lactin model were used to develop a linear model: 
 <italic class="italic">y = a + bx</italic>, where 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> is the rate of development at temperature 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>; 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic> is the

 <italic class="italic">b</italic> is the slope. Using the parameter estimates, the lower developmental threshold (LDT) was calculated asâ€”(
