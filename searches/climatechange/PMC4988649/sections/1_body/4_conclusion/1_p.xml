<p class="p">Results herein provide fundamental information regarding the thermal development of all the life stages of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> development from egg to adult emergence would occur within the thermal range of 12.4°C and 37.8°C (i.e., between LDT and UDT) and the fastest growth was observed at 32.5°C (i.e., optimum temperature for development). This study also showed how the mite’s voltinism could be affected by not only future temperature increases but also host bees’ temperature-dependent spring emergence which is also affected by the future temperature increase. Temperature can play a major role in altering voltinism of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> according to the future climate change scenarios; the number of generations of the mite would increase by 1.5–2.0 times by the year of 2100.
