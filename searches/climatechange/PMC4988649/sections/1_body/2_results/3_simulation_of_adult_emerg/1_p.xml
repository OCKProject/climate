<p class="p">The mean number of generations per month, estimated from degree-days available per month at KTFREC, was shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. We found differences in the degree-days accumulated depending on the calendar months (F
 <sub class="sub">11, 107</sub> = 276.30, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and the number of generations possible for

 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> per month (F
 <sub class="sub">11, 107</sub> = 248.18, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.01). The number of generations highly varied depending on the season, with the lowest (0.01) in February and the highest (2.16) in July. At least one generation per month would be possible during Mayâ€“September. Based on the biofix of January 1

 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> ranged from 8.6 to 10.7 generations at KTFREC over the past nine years (
