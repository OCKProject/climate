<p class="p">Spatial distributions of projected number of generations of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> over the eastern United States showed significant differences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161319.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) among the years of 2015, 2050, and 2100 under the four RCP scenarios. In 2015, the voltinism from the four RCP scenarios was estimated to be 6–10 generations in the eastern part of West Virginia where KTFREC was located. This estimation of voltinism based on the future climate scenarios was consistent with that from our simulation using two different biofixes at KTFREC. The voltinism of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> was generally higher in the lower latitude regions in the eastern United States. In 2015, the voltinism was consistent among the four RCP scenarios with gradual increasing from four to eighteen generations from the northern to southern parts of the eastern United States. The number of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> generations increased by 2050 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161319.g005" class="xref">Fig 5B–5E, 5H and 5K</xref>) and more apparent increase was predicted by 2100 (

 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> generations in the eastern United States from 2015 to 2100 were different among the four RCP scenarios (
