<p class="p">To examine the temporal dynamics of the

 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> voltinism under the future climate scenarios, we performed the liner regression analysis by using the time series of the generation number. The number of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> generations was estimated to be significantly (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161319.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). The greatest rate of increase in voltinism was 0.83 generations per decade based on the RCP 8.5 over the 95 years from 2006 to 2100. The predicted rates of increase in voltinism based on the RCP 6.0 and 4.5 were 0.55 and 0.40 generation per decade, respectively. In RCP 2.6, the lowest rate of increase in voltinism was 0.16 generation per decade and the time-series trend appeared relatively stationary beyond 2050. The results under the projected climate change indicated that the number of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> generations in the central Appalachian regions would increase more likely up to 1.5–2.0 times above their current levels (i.e., 8–10 generations per year) by the end of the 21
