<p class="p">Given a cohort of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> eggs under constant temperatures, the predicted daily frequency (%) of adult emergence was presented in relation to temperature (°C) and time (day) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0161319.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). The predicted values showed that adult emergence of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> would occur earlier at the optimum temperature in much shorter time but the adult emergence at both ends of temperatures would occur later over extended periods. From a cohort of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> eggs, for instance, the adult emergence would occur in 8–10 days at 34°C, whereas it would take 70–84 days at 12°C and 21–25 days at 37°C.
