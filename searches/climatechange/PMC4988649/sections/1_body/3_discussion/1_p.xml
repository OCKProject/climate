 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> development from egg to adult emergence would occur within the thermal range of 12.4°C and 37.8°C (i.e., between LDT and UDT) and the fastest growth was observed at 32.5°C (i.e., optimum temperature for development). At the optimum temperature, it would take 8.54 days for the mite egg to develop into adult, which also indicates the maximum number of generations would be possible in a season when the ambient temperature prevails near the optimum temperature or at locations where temperature in regional climate stays longer near the optimum temperature. When an actual field temperature was used to calculate the voltinism more realistically (
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>), the mite would be able to complete up to 8–10 generations per year in Kearneysville, West Virginia (USA). Seasonal pattern of voltinism at the location showed much variation depending on the months with higher values in summer (May-September), which clearly suggests that the early application of control measures on the infested nest must be considered to prevent the rapid population increase in summer.
