 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> and the

 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees and 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> would respond differently exposed to the same temperature in the field. While the short-term exposure of high temperature is of great interest for the management of

 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> (i.e., sensitivity to high temperature), the relatively small and realistic change of climate in the long-term may alter drastically the host-parasite interaction, geographical distribution, and abundance as shown in other species [

 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Despite sensitivity to high temperature extremes, the mite may acquire tolerance to the extreme by acclimation following non-lethal condition and the slowly-elevated temperature may allow an increase in the voltinism per year due to faster development and longer season available for multiple reproductive phases.
