 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> voltinism depicted by the increased number of generations from north to south over the eastern United States. Additionally, the lower numbers of generations in the central and southern Appalachian regions, compared to the surrounding regions in the same latitudes, were generally explained by showing the isolines bending southward in the mountainous regions (
