<p class="p">In addition to temperature, water vapor deficit (VPD) can be an important factor that affects 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> under future climate change. VPD is the difference between saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Actual vapor pressure and relative humidity are linearly associated when air temperature is constant and saturation vapor pressure increases exponentially as temperature increases [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Therefore, under the condition with increased VPDs at higher temperature, insects and mites can lose higher amount of moisture to the air by evaporation. Although the effect of VPD on 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> has not been reported, previous studies documented increased mortality of some predatory mites (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Amblyseius cucumis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Neoseiulus califonicus</italic>) at higher VPDs [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. We also observed a higher mortality rate of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> at higher temperatures in our study, which also could be caused by higher VPDs because relative humidity was kept constant at 60±10% in all growth chambers (i.e. same or very similar actual vapor pressures across chambers). However, no studies have found that VPD could affect the rate of insect or mite development which is a key function in modeling temperature-dependent development of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> in our study although effects of VPD on mite development was studied [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Cook et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] successfully simulated the increased VPD with the RCP 8.5 scenarios at the global scale, and thus additional studies to investigate the effect of various VPDs on mite development could lead to incorporating VPD in the development model and generating more realistic prediction of future biological events of the mite (e.g. development period and voltinism).
