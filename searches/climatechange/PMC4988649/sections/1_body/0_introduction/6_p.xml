<p class="p">Despite the economic importance of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> as a key pest of 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees, little is known about the effect of temperature on the developmental biology of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic>. This mite does not have any temperature regulation system in its body or behavior adaptation, which makes it an ideal organism to measure the impact of temperature change. This study was conducted (1) to investigate stage-specific development of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> at constant temperatures, (2) to develop empirical models to describe thermal development of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic>, and (3) to predict the spatial and temporal changes in voltinism (i.e., the number of generations) of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> under the future climate scenarios.
