<p class="p">The Krombein’s hairy-fingered mite, 
 <italic class="italic">Chaetodactylus krombeini</italic> (Acari: Chaetodactylidae), is a cleptoparasitic mite of 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees (Hymenoptera: Megachilidae) which are major or supplementary bees for orchard pollination. 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees collect pollen in the field and provision in the nest to feed their larvae. The mite steals and consumes the pollen (i.e. cleptoparasitic), which causes the decline of 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bee populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. At high density of over 50 adults per cell in an 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> nest [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> can kill the bee eggs [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] and larvae [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] by attacking and consuming directly. Even if the bee eggs and larvae survive under heavy infestation of the mites within the same cell, the adult bees suffer from reduced fecundity [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and their pollination efficiency is reduced because the bees get irritated by the mites on their body. Therefore, among the pests of 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees, 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">krombeini</italic> is known as a key pest that affects the maintenance and propagation of 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> bees for orchard pollination in the United States [
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. If the mite infestation is not controlled in an orchard, 
 <italic class="italic">Osmia</italic> populations could decrease to half from previous year’s size [
