 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Then, a typical life cycle (i.e. egg, larva, protonymph, tritonymph and adult) is repeated and the mites build up their population throughout summer. Later in the season when temperature decreases or pollen provisions are scarce in the nest, protonymphs become either phoretic or encysted deutonymphs for overwintering [
