<p class="p">Temperature is a key abiotic environmental factor that influences growth, development, survival and reproduction of poikilothermic arthropods including insects and mites [

 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Although some social insects (e.g. honey bees) can decrease the temperature of their nests by fanning their wings, most of arthropods do not have the ability to manipulate temperature within their nests, making them more vulnerable to temperature increase. Arthropod development occurs within a limited range of temperatures and the thermal range varies among arthropod species. Various empirical models have been applied to describe the relationship between temperature and developmental parameters including the lower and upper developmental thresholds and optimal temperatures [

 <xref rid="pone.0161319.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. In addition, developmental parameters often have been applied for optimizing mass rearing systems, predicting phenology, modeling population growth, determining geographical distribution, and simulating climate change impact [
