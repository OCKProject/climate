<p class="p">The agents of productive and financial capital cooperated fruitfully in the Japanese PV industry but failed to do so in the United States. The failure represents an expression of an inherent tension between the entrepreneurial and financial components of innovation. Recognizing this tension is crucial to understand the challenge of industrial transformation required to avoid catastrophic climate change. It cannot be assumed that, by correcting market failure by putting a price on carbon, the financial system will adjust passively. Although a carbon tax would make low-carbon technology in general more competitive, there is no way of knowing which specific future technologies will succeed. The only sure thing is that most new technologies will fail. Innovation is always uncertain and wise to avoid if there are easier ways to make money off of speculation. Keynes noted that the ever-present tendency toward financialization calls for a substantial share of public investment. This is particularly true of extra-market goals, such as the mitigation of climate. Because, in Keynesâ€™ theory, resources are almost never fully used, public investment does not compete with private investment. The importance of specific knowledge in financing decisions means that these public entities should have very specialized domains of operation. Perhaps, the recently expanded role of central banks in economic governance could play a role in developing low-carbon technology, a topic worthy of future investigation.</p>
