<p class="p">Another reason to view creative destruction through a sociological frame is the inherently uncertain nature of innovation and the centrality that perceptions of the future this entails. As game theory indicates, isolated individuals acting under uncertainty lead to suboptimal “prisoner’s dilemma”–type outcomes. Uncertainty compels actors to adopt a prosocial orientation, turning market transactions into hierarchical transactions and limiting transactions to known parties and those with a reputable standing, among others (

Because the future is unknowable, investment decisions are always made on the subjective basis of confidence in the future, what Keynes called “animal spirits.” Routine investments can be made by extrapolating past trends into the future, but investments in innovation must be based on more elaborate “fictional constructions” of future states (
