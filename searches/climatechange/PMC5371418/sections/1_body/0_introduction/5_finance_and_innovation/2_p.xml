<p class="p">Joseph Schumpeter noted that introducing a financial sphere into a static economy makes it dynamic (

It orients the economy toward the future, changing calculations of economic value from including only existing resources to also including those resources that might be expected to exist in the future. As a result, the horizon opens up to potentially infinite possibilities for technological advances. This shift also introduces a certain fictitious quality to the economy because the future is unknowable and expectations will inevitably diverge from actual outcomes. Financial claims correspond to the value of real assets, but the correspondence is never absolute. This separation between present and future value that finance introduces is what gives capitalism its instability. Schumpeter saw that finance destabilizes the economy by enabling entrepreneurs to introduce innovations that cause creative destruction. However, it can also be destabilizing in a different way. Finance has a tendency to decouple from production and fuel asset bubbles instead of industrial change. It then becomes a tool of value extraction instead of creation, a process that we now recognize as financialization. Schumpeter had a lucid analysis of the role of finance in production, but the full implications were better explored by his student Hyman Minsky. The theories of both will be used to guide the empirical study. The future orientation of technological development also calls for an inclusion of economic sociology into the analysis to account for the formation of perceptions and social mechanisms to overcome uncertainty. Sociology is also needed to account for the fact that capitalism, as Schumpeter and Minsky insisted, is an evolutionary system that interacts with changing institutions over time. What follows is a summary of Schumpeter’s views of the role of finance in industrial development, Minsky’s additions, and a set of sociological tools to situate their universal logic in concrete social and institutional settings.
