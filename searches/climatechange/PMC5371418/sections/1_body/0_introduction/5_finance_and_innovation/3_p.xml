<p class="p">Because it takes time to assemble innovations before they can generate a return, Schumpeter argued that the process must be paid for in advance. The mechanism that makes this possible is credit. That is why Schumpeter defined capitalism as a system “in which innovations are carried out by means of borrowed money” [(

 </xref>), chapter 3]. Capitalist production depends upon the interaction of two roles, the financier and the entrepreneur. The financier owns monetary claims to real wealth and operates by leveraging them in pursuit of more claims. The entrepreneur operates by producing the real wealth that makes financial claims valuable in the first place. In Schumpeter’s view of capitalism, financiers create credit for entrepreneurs, who spend it into existence in the act of investment; the bank notes circulate as money throughout the economy and end up as profit on the balance sheets of the most innovative entrepreneurs, allowing them to repay the debt. If there is money left, they can plow it back into further innovation, repeating the circuit on a larger scale. An expanded market share can act as a staging ground for increasingly capital-intensive innovation, creating barriers to entry for new entrepreneurs; however, as long as these have access to credit, they can introduce innovations that make the technologies of incumbent firms obsolete. This system of decentralized credit creation for innovation and continuously reinvested profits makes for a highly dynamic economy in which the means of production are continuously revolutionized.
