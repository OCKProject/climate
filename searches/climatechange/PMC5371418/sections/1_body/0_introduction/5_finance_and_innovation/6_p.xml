<p class="p">Hence, what is missing from Schumpeter’s theory is the fact that innovation is not the only use for which credit can be created: It can also be created to buy existing assets, in which case it does not fuel creative destruction but asset bubbles. There is also a limit to how much profit firms can reinvest. Production under capitalism is carried out for profit, and some point in the circuit profit will be extracted from the enterprise to be stored as liquid wealth. Only if capitalists are as austere as the monk-like toilers of Max Weber’s

 </xref>), the common practice of storing wealth in cash and existing assets leaves real resources in the economy unused. As long as hoarding and speculation are available as options to financiers, their willingness to invest in innovation is limited. It is safer to live off the income streams of past investments, as “rentiers.” A fully production-oriented economy is only possible if the financial component of capitalism is entirely subordinated to the entrepreneurial function, in which case it might no longer be recognizable as capitalism at all, but rather a centrally planned economy where decentralized financial decisions are curtailed.
