<p class="p">This study is informed by Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction, which remains the most useful tool for understanding industrial change; it also is influenced by the financial insights of Schumpeter’s student, Hyman Minsky. Economic sociology will also be applied to analyze the central role of uncertainty in innovation and the social mechanisms to overcome uncertainty in concrete social and institutional conditions. These insights will be outlined in a rather lengthy theoretical section. The goal is to provide a coherent synthesis of three large and synergistic bodies of work, ranging from a stylized view of the microlevel interactions between entrepreneurs and financiers (and workers) up to the macrolevel of institutional arrangements of comparative capitalisms. Beyond shedding light on the emergence of the industry under study, this synthesis might be used to guide other similar studies. A more comprehensive study would include an in-depth analysis of industrial policy and the social forces behind it, but as the study will show, changes to corporate governance were major determinants of the outcome because industrial policy was dominated by large firms in both countries.</p>
