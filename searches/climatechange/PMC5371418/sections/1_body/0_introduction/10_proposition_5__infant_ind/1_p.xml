Because firms rarely innovate in ways that would undermine their existing capabilities, the protected spaces for radical new low-carbon technologies would likely have to be provided by the state (

Therefore, analyzing industry emergence makes it necessary to find out the extent to which immature technologies allowed protected spaces to mature.
