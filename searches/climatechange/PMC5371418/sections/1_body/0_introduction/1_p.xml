<p class="p">Reducing carbon emissions to safe levels means replacing the present industrial system. Low-carbon technologies, which are currently marginal, need to become competitive enough to mount a wave of “creative destruction,” to use Joseph Schumpeter’s (

Technological revolutions normally occur when profit opportunities in established industries are exhausted, but this one would have to occur much sooner, engineered through state policy. Ultimately, however, state policy is only as effective as the innovative capacity of private firms. It is therefore concerning that this capacity appears to have been weakened by financialization (

Ever-larger amounts of credit have been created to trade existing assets such as real estate rather than productive investments. The most visible effect of this process has been a series of asset bubbles, followed by painful periods of deleveraging [(

As John Maynard Keynes recognized, capitalist economies always contain the capacity for both “enterprise” and “speculation,” and if left unchecked, the latter will come to dominate over the former. Economists at the Bank for International Settlements have found that financialization harms innovative firms, which operate by creating intangible future assets that are difficult to collateralize (

While the financial sector has grown as a share of advanced economies, nonfinancial firms have become financialized, drawing profits from financial activities and orienting their strategy toward maximizing the value of their financial assets instead of productive ones. Hyman Minsky feared that this process, already visible by the 1980s, would not only cause fragility but also would undermine “the capital development of the economy,” that is, the development of its productive capabilities (
