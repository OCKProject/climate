Official estimates held that this would become a reality sometime by the mid to late 1980s. Proponents of this view favored a massive increase in research and development to improve the efficiency of solar cells in the laboratory until they could compete with centralized energy production. A rapid move toward large-scale mass production was considered necessary to bring down costs. Both activities were capital-intensive, which meant that they needed to be conducted by large corporations. This preference had both ideal and material causes. The U.S. Energy Research and Development Agency that was responsible for developing PV was made up mostly of members from the recently disbanded U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. Their views were shaped by the experience of nuclear energy, a technology where large-scale and centralized energy production was the norm. Large manufacturing corporations also had a natural preference for large scale and centralization, and the research and production subsidies it would bring. In addition, naturally, utilities did not want decentralized energy producers as competitors.
