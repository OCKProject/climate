<p class="p">In the early 1970s, when the American solar energy industry did not yet exist, there were two competing visions of where it should head. One camp consisted of a small number of entrepreneurs who had been involved in producing solar cells for the space program or pioneered their application on Earth. They envisioned an industry of small-scale energy production off the grid [(

The pioneers saw a reasonably large potential in selling solar panels for these applications as roadside emergency phones, signaling systems for train crossings, electric fences, mountain-top communication centers, African villages, navigational aids, and consumer electronics. These markets could be served by small firms, without much investment in research or large production facilities. Profits from these sales could then be plowed back into technical improvements, enabling a further and gradual expansion of the market to less-remote locations until the technology was viable for widespread use. Modest policy measures, such as mandating solar-powered lights at remote train crossings, were considered more helpful to spur the industry than lavish research grants [(
