Then, as the 1970s progressed, most of them were purchased by large conglomerates in the oil and electronics industries. Finally, in the 1980s, the conglomerates were broken up and their solar divisions were dismantled or sold off to foreign firms. There were large differences in how the original entrepreneurs and the large conglomerates viewed the future of the industry.
