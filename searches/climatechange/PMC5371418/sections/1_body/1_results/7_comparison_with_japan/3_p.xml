<p class="p">Japanese electronics firms’ main competitive advantage was financial commitment, secured through close ties with banks (

Perhaps even more important than access to reliable credit was retained earnings and Japanese managers’ ability to exercise strategic control over them without regarding to shareholders’ interests. Managers were freed from “the restrictions of short-term perspectives” to set “long-term goals” [(

Because of the institutional arrangement of cross-shareholding, in which firms held each other’s shares for the long term, Japan did not experience a “shareholder revolution” as the United States.

Crucially, Japanese PV producers were not subject to the “market for corporate control.” Beyond protecting against hostile takeovers, cross-shareholding meant that Japanese managers were “under less compulsion to sustain high quarterly profits than their U.S. counterparts, and therefore freer to focus on long-term expansion of market share” [(
