<p class="p">During the period 1975â€“2015, the average annual rainfall over the Adyar sub-basin has been observed to be 1472 mm. The contribution of different seasons to the annual rainfall is as follows: post monsoon (October to December) rainfall is the major contributor (59.6%) followed by monsoon (June to September) rainfall (32.6%), summer (March to May) rainfall (4.9%), and finally winter (January to February) rainfall (2.8%). The Adyar sub-basin is a flat terrain with slight undulations, and hence the Adyar river is almost stagnant except during rainy seasons. Any unexpected rainfall over the sub-basin rapidly increases the water level in the river due to the flat terrain of the Adyar sub-basin. Hence, it increases the risk of flooding in the Adyar river and its surrounding areas [
