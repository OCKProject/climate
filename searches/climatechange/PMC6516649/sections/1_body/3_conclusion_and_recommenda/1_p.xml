<p class="p">This study is supported by 30 years (1975–2015) of the observed rainfall data collected from the IMD Meenambakkam station, 70 years (2016–2085) of the future projection data from the selected four GCMs, and GPS points collected from the field survey. The analysis of the past rainfall shows that there is an increase in the number of extreme events in the past decade. The rainfall projections also show that extreme events would be increasing in the future, which is a clear indication of the impact of climate change. An increase in the rainfall intensity leads to higher peak discharge and thus substantially increases the flood risks [
 <xref rid="pone.0216461.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Hence, the projection of the rainfall intensity is considered important in all flood modeling studies. The IDF curves are considered useful for providing rainfall intensities for the area that receives high rainfall in a shorter duration. Based on the extreme rainfall intensity for the present and the future, the IDF curves are derived, which further help in identifying the extreme rainfall events that occur as a result of climate change.
