Based on the observed data, the model simulated the peak discharge of 1021 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s, 1548 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s, 1896 m
 <sup class="sup">3/</sup>s, 2665 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s, and 3022 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods, respectively. It is clear from the model simulation results that flood events might occur for the 10-year return period and above because the peak discharge exceeds the flood-carrying capacity of the Adyar river. For the period 2015â€“2085, peak discharges of the Adyar river for different return periods were simulated according to the future climate scenarios. For the 2-year return period, the peak discharge ranges from 1054 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s to 1190 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. For the 100-year return period, the peak discharge ranges from 4060 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s to 5800 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s, which is almost double that of the past climate scenarios. A comparison of the peak discharges shows a significant increase in the observed and projected GCMs for the 2, 5, 10, 50, and 100-year return periods (
