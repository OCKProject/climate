<p class="p">In Nepal, agriculture is a major source of income and forms the basis of livelihoods for the majority of the population. The importance of this sector for the nation’s economy was underlined with the approval of a revised Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS) in 2014, which supports further commercialization of the sector [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The ADS will guide the agricultural sector of Nepal over the next 20 years and one of it’s most important aspects is strengthening agribusiness. The strategy supports a shift from pure subsistence to a more commercial agriculture sector with the expansion of cash crop production, increased produce exports and import substitution. Two crops, banana (

 <italic class="italic">Coffea arabica</italic>), both saw a huge expansion over the last decade concerning plantation area and production. Wild

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], although the history of growing bananas in plantations is not clear. Domestication of bananas has been recorded for over a thousand years in the Ganges plains and adjoining regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], which suggest that banana plantations in the lowlands of Nepal are unlikely to be a recent development. Coffee was introduced to Nepal in 1938 but took a long time to be established in commercial plantations. The first commercial plantation in Nepal was established in 1981, after which plantation growing spread to 41 out of 75 districts [

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Rapidly expanding tourism in Nepal after 1990 led to increased consumption of coffee in Nepal, while at the same time coffee drinking became increasingly popular among Nepalese themselves, resulting in an expanding domestic market. According to information from the Ministry of Agriculture Development [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], the plantation area of both crops are rapidly expanding. In 2014, domestic production only met about 90% of total domestic demand for bananas. Coffee exports from Nepal continue to increase, and it is now established as one of the country’s most important agricultural commodities [
