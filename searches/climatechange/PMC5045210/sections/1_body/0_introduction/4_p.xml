<p class="p">Adaptation of agricultural systems to climate change can potentially be addressed through a number of strategies including the spatial shifting of crop production systems to follow suitable climatic conditions, conversion of monoculture plantations to intercropping systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], or the application of improved production practices. It is also essential to develop models that can be used to predict how the locations and extents of areas suitable for the production of focal crop species will change under future climate change scenarios. Likewise, projected warmer and wetter bioclimatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] and the shift of bioclimatic zones upslope [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] may present opportunities for crop diversification, open new areas for plantations, as well as increasing the potential for future expansion of these cropping systems. Species distribution modelling (SDM) can be an inexpensive, quick and flexible tool for identifying the climatic envelope and projections of climate impacts on the crops [

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Identifying suitable climatic zones before planning crop plantations can greatly minimize input costs such as externally supplied heat and irrigation [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In addition, SDM can be used to match adaptation policies and practices to anticipated or observed climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. An ensemble approach which combines various modelling algorithms based on their individual performance and generates a consensus map greatly reduces the uncertainties which would result from the use of a single model [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. BiodiversityR provide sets of functions for suitability mapping based on an ensemble of modelling algorithms. The advantage of this package is that it allows direct handling of model formulae and the functions that select algorithms for ensemble output [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The ensemble is based on consensus results that combined only the most successful algorithms, according to the statistical criterion [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. In this study, we analyze and model current and projected future bioclimatic conditions to assess the suitability and spatial delineation of coffee and banana production zones, the impacts of climate change, potential new production zones, and intercropping opportunities for selected crops.
