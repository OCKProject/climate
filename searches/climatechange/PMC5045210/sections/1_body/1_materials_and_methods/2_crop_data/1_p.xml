<p class="p">We compiled secondary data from yearly statistical reports, district profiles, newspapers and online sources, and reports from different organizations [e.g.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s002" class="xref">S1 References</xref>). The secondary data provide important information on commercial plantation districts and the extent and location of banana and coffee growing (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s001" class="xref">S1 Dataset</xref>). We visited several districts and localities during 2014 and recorded plantation locations. Another source of plantation information was interviews with smallholder farmers, community-based organization staff and field-based staff of HELVETAS Nepal. Based on the dataset compiled we prepared a grid for the presence of two crops (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). We conducted grid-based analysis using 30 arc second resolution bioclimatic and geo-data set to generate production zone mapping. A high number (n = 10,000) of background (pseudo-absence data) was selected within a diameter of 200km around geo-referenced crop points. All the points that were outside the areas of interest were discarded. We performed Moran’s I test to check spatial auto-correlation after data treatment. Moran’s I values were 0.5 and 0.4 (p&lt;0.001) for banana and coffee, respectively, indicating clustering of the data [
