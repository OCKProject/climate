<p class="p">Reconstructed GEnS and bioclimatic layers were prepared based on the ensemble CIMP5 projections. The layers were used to model the future spatial distribution of climatic suitability for coffee and banana crops. Aspect and slope were used as limiting factors. LULC classes (e.g. agricultural land, built-up area, forested area; see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s005" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>), the future projections of which have not yet been created, were used as a dummy variable in all models. Land use change is likely to occur within the next 30â€“40 years due to the expansion of populated areas, cultivation of new land in some areas, and reforestation in others; however, for the purposes of this study and the limits of the available data, we have had to assume that land cover remains stable.
