<p class="p">The next step was projecting into future climatic scenarios. The calibrations and weights determined as described above were projected into ensemble results of each RCPs as future climatic layers to generate ensemble outputs that included consensus raster layers for future climatic scenarios. The consensus layer summarized the presence-absence (1â€“0) of focal species for each grid cell based on a threshold defined by maximizing the sum of the true presence and true absence rates.</p>
