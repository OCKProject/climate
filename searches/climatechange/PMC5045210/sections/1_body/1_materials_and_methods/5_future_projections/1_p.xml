<p class="p">First, the GEnS up to 2050 were reconstructed by an ensemble of 19 Earth System Models provided by the 19 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project—Phase 5 (CIMP5; [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]), using the same set of significant variables described above for GEnS. Within each of the 19 CIMP5, there are four representative concentration pathways (RCP) [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], ranging from RCP 2.6 (aggressive mitigation / lowest emissions) to RCP 8.5 (highest emissions scenario). All models available within each RCP were combined into a majority ensemble result, using the class with the majority of occurrence within any particular grid cell as the class for that location [

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] tested the robustness of the CIMP5 model ensemble based on historical observation data (1985–2005) and found a high correlation when using multi-model averages.
