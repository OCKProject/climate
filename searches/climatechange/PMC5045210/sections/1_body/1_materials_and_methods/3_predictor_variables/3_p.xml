<p class="p">Zomer et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] used this modeled environmental stratification approach to examine the impact of projected climate change on eco-regions within the Kailash Sacred Landscape and on rubber plantation areas in Xishuangbanna, China [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We used this approach, along with other bio-climatic variables obtained from different sources (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s004" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>) to examine the potential distribution of banana and coffee crops using multi-model ensemble modelling based on the theory of ecological niche modelling (ENM). The bioclimatic variables were selected based on iterative calculations of variance inflation factors (VIF) [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s005" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>) to list a set of least correlated bioclimatic variables. The bioclimatic variables including GEnS, physical variables such as aspect, slope and land-cover (LC) were used to calibrate and generate the ensemble model (

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] was treated as a dummy variable and was used as a limiting factor in the distribution model (detailed category of LC is shown in
