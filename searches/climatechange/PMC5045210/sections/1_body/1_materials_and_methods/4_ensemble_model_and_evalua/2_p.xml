<p class="p">Using Hijmansâ€™ method for spatial sorting [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], bias was removed through several rounds of calibrating and evaluating all models (including the geographical null model), each time using three partitions for model calibration and one partition for model evaluation [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Details of sub-models and cAUCs are provided in the Supporting Information (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s008" class="xref">S6 Table</xref>). We repeated this process and compared the 20 resulting cAUCs of each ensemble models with that of the geographical null model by means of Mann-Whitney tests. Removal of spatial sorting bias in testing data for different model calibrations yielded AUC values for the null model between 0.48 and 0.51 (for both crops), which is equivalent to a random draw [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>], and cAUCs values of the different individual modelling algorithms between 0.55 to 0.80 for both crops (significantly different from null model; Mann-Whitney tests, p &lt; 0.05 in all cases). Only sub-models that gave cAUC values, which were significantly higher than the null model were retained in the ensemble model used for projections.
