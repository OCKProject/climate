<p class="p">We used BiodiversityR package (version 2.4â€“1) in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] to prepare for consensus mapping of species distributions. Consensus mapping is a mapping technique that is based on an ensemble of several niche-modelling algorithms (sub-models). We calibrated 19 ENM algorithms (

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], we used 4-fold cross-validation, where crop location and background data was partitioned into 75% calibration and 25% evaluation. Spatial autocorrelation among species presence and background points was quite high, as indicated by the Moran I test (see section Crop data). We evaluated the ability of sub-models to cope with spatial autocorrelation by calculating calibrated Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (cAUC) values and comparing these with a geographical null model [
