<p class="p">Our results for banana crops show the positive changes in suitability of banana in the lowlands areas, including lower elevation areas in the middle hills. Banana plants have a short lifespan, and are relatively adaptable to future conditions. This indicates that banana could be a key crop in the future context of climate change, in which it will also be important to increase national production and improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers. In contrast, the long lifespan of coffee—ranging from about 30 to 50 years—is likely to mean current plantations will struggle to adapt to the impacts of future climate, as the majority of the current coffee growing area in Nepal will become unsuitable in the future. Several research studies around the world have revealed coffee to be highly sensitive to climate change [

Current major coffee growing areas are predicted to suffer badly due to climate change, while there are predictions of a dramatic and profound decrease (13–90% under different modelling approaches) in the bioclimatically suitable localities of the world’s dominant coffee production regions (Brazil, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Kenya) by 2050 and 2080 [
