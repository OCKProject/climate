<p class="p">In Nepal, the biggest factor responsible for a decline in the suitable production area of coffee by 2050 is the shift in bioclimatic zones in this region [

 <xref rid="pone.0163916.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The predicted rise in temperature of 1.6 to 2.5Â°C, along with the tremendously steep slopes in the Himalayas is a major limiting factor in the suitability of coffee-producing areas. Research conducted in Uganda shows that rising temperatures are not only responsible for the reduction in the suitable production zones, but that they also reduce the size of coffee beans and the quality of coffee [
