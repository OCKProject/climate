<p class="p">Substantial changes in the spatial distribution of bioclimatic zones and their associated strata were evident in the projected future distribution maps—for instance, the colder zones such as ‘extremely cold and wet’ and ‘cold and wet’ were reduced by about 60–70%. The onset of completely novel bioclimatic conditions was evident through the appearance of the ‘extremely hot and xeric’ zone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), a set of bioclimatic conditions not currently seen in present-day Nepal. In addition, noticeable changes indicated that there will be significant displacement of agro-ecological zones which will ultimately impact crop production and food security. For the two focal crops, changes in relevant bioclimatic zones, notably ‘Hot and mesic’ (expansion), ‘Hot and dry’ (reduction), ‘Extremely hot and moist’ (expansion), and ‘Warm temperate and mesic’ (reduction) will have direct impacts. In addition to that, all the CIMP5 scenarios show the appearance of this new “extremely hot and xeric” zone in the lowlands in Nepal (see
