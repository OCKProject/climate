<p class="p">Changes in the suitable area available for the two focal crops by 2050 were indicated by changes in suitability scores averaged across all four RCPs. The current suitable area for banana was projected to decrease by 16.7±2.1% by 2050. The current suitable area for coffee was projected to decrease by 72.6±4.4% by 2050. About 40.7±5.2% new area will become suitable for banana plantations, but only 11.9±2.3% of new suitable area for coffee (
