<p class="p">The models show suitable areas for banana mostly below 1,200m in the baseline scenario, with the major production zone occurring below 300m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g005" class="xref">Fig 5a</xref>). By 2050, the limit of suitable area was predicted to shift upwards to about 1,500m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g005" class="xref">Fig 5a</xref> RCP scenarios). The upward mean elevation shift in the major production zones was found to be about 15m by 2050. Likewise, the area suitable for coffee cultivation remained below 1,500m. Between 600 m to 1,350m, a major shift was indicated, with major production zones shifting by about 150m by 2050 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g005" class="xref">Fig 5b</xref>). Projections across different scenarios showed suitability might occur up to about 2,500m by 2050 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0163916.g005" class="xref">Fig 5b</xref> RCP scenarios). Fuzzy overlay of the future suitability of banana and current suitability of coffee revealed that in 37.3Â±2.0% of current coffee suitable areas, banana can be introduced for intercropping. Suitability for intercropping mostly occurred between 700 to 1,200m elevation.
