<p class="p">The trained and tested models were applied using the geospatial dataset for the selected bioclimatic variables, geographical, landuse and environmental stratification (listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0163916.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), to give a distribution map of current suitability for each of the two crops. Results from models with positive weights were combined into ensemble outputs that included consensus spatial layers for current climatic conditions. In the final ensemble output, 15 sub-models were used for banana and 15 sub-models for coffee (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0163916.s009" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>). All the habitat suitability sub-models for banana show consistency and used in the final output of results. In the case of coffee, habitat suitability for coffee was consistent in most of the models.
