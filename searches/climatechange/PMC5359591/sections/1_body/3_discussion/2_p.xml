<p class="p">The management of volunteer potatoes by using the soil frost control method is a promising strategy to adapt to climate change, which was initiated by some local farmers and supported by national and local research institutes, and it has become widely accepted by many local farmers and researchers. Soil freezing is known to be largely suppressed by thick snow cover, i.e. the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> can be estimated using the freezing index (the summation of daily mean air temperatures for days with temperature of below 0 °C until the snow cover thickness becomes 0.20 m or more)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Therefore, our on-farm soil frost control might likely be applicable in regions where air temperature drops sufficiently (mean air temperature, −12 to −5 °C during December to February) and the continuous snow cover appears early in winter when the mean precipitation reaches 50 to 150 mm during December to January
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Since the principle of soil frost control is to simply offset the heat-insulating effect of thick snow cover in order to expose soil surface to cold air, it can be easily performed over a large area of several tens of hectares by using common agricultural machineries by individual local farmers in a less time-consuming and labour-saving manner
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. That is, the effectiveness of the soil frost control method has certain limitations depending on the magnitude and rate of climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. As mentioned above, if cold winter is accompanied by extremely short snowfall, the ambient D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> would be greater than 0.33 m; deep soil frost development would have adverse effects, because soil frost depth cannot be controlled without snowpack. In contrast, in the case of warm winter, soil freezing would be limited, and hence would not be sufficient to achieve the control of volunteer potatoes. However, the climate change scenarios for the Tokachi region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>, i.e. mean air temperature in winter changes from current (−8 °C) to the late 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (2081–2100; −5 °C), suggest that the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of around 0.3 m can be achieved
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Therefore, the optimum D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> determined in the present study could contribute to the improvement and provision of more options to perform multiple and immediate adaptation actions over different regions and times in potato-harvested bare fields. In addition to bare fields, the soil frost control method and concept of optimum D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> can be applied for the overwintering condition such as fields cultivated with winter wheat (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Furthermore, the soil frost control method can be utilised to prevent ground water pollution by facilitating soil nitrate remaining on the surface layer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref> regardless of whether the fields were cultivated with potato or not. Scientists in the national and local research institutes need to provide scientific background for perspective practices of farmers in order to establish user- and environmental-friendly effective adaptation actions against climate changes in agriculture.
