<p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change has become a major societal concern, and knowledge about effective adaptations to climate change are gradually accumulating in public and private sectors in agriculture worldwide
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. For example, in the Tokachi region, the largest potato (
 <italic class="italic">Solanum tuberosum</italic> L.) production area in Japan, soil frost depth has decreased since the late 1980s because of climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Shallow soil frost development was found to facilitate the overwintering of unharvested small potato tubers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Therefore, volunteer potatoes have become a serious weed problem in the local rotation cropping system and in seed production
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. To overcome this problem, local farmers in the Tokachi region began to remove snow cover during winter by using agricultural machineries such as tractors and bulldozers to enhance the freeze-kill of potato tubers. However, the lack of knowledge and experience occasionally hindered the control of the depth of soil frost penetration
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Subsequently, a national research institute in collaboration with some local research institutes developed a web-based decision support system that assisted in controlling the annual maximum soil frost depth (D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>). This system involves (1) real-time visualisation of the daily predicted soil frost depth by using a mathematical model to determine soil temperature at an arbitrary depth under the snow cover
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref> and (2) an alerting service suggesting the recommended timing for conducting snow cover manipulation at each field. This system suggested that, for soil frost control, the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> should range from 0.3 to 0.4â€‰m in order to ensure the eradication of potatoes with minimised labour, cost, and risk in agriculture (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Thus, controlling soil frost depth by using a scientifically sound method has enabled the management of volunteer potatoes over an area of several tens of hectares per farming household without requiring agrochemicals or heavy labour in summer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. At present, volunteer potato management by using the soil frost control method has become common among the farmers in and around the Tokachi region, eastern Hokkaido, northern Japan.
