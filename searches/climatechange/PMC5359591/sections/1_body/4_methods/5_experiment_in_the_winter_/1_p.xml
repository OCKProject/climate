<p class="p">In 2008 and 2009, winter wheat (
 <italic class="italic">Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) was cultivated in an experimental field where the effect of tillage intensity on crop productivity and greenhouse gas fluxes of soil were tested
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Basal nitrogen fertilizer was applied at 60 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> following local conventional agricultural practices. Snow cover thickness was not manipulated during December 2008 to March 2009, i.e. no snow cover manipulation treatment was performed at the conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) plots, which have 8-m width from east to west and 48-m length from north to south (both were 384 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in size). These plots were 13 m apart from each other from east (RT) to west (CT). The soil frost depth was measured once weekly or more by using the frost tube method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>, and the annual maximum soil frost depth (D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) was found to be 0.12 m and 0.14 m at the CT and RT plots, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). In the succeeding year, 2009–2010, winter wheat was cultivated in a similar manner, and a snow cover manipulation experiment was conducted alternately for 3 snow cover compaction and ambient control plots; each experimental plot had a size of 64 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Snow cover compaction was performed twice a month in December 2009 and January 2010 by using a tractor
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>; the mean D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of triplicated plots was 0.49 m and 0.47 m at the treatment plots compared to 0.05 m and 0.04 m at the control plots of CT and RT, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). Soil samples were collected from each plot from 0–0.40 m by using a hand-auger at 0.10-m intervals in mid-December and early May to estimate the nitrate content in the surface soil before snowfall and after snowmelt. Well-mixed fresh soil samples were shaken with 2 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> of potassium chloride solution for 60 min to extract nitrate, and its concentration in the extract was determined using the copper-cadmium reduction method by using a flow analysis system (QuAAtro; SEAL Analytical Gmbh, Norderstedt, Germany). The mean soil nitrate content (mg N kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dry soil) for the 0.10-m thick soil was converted to the unit of kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> by separately determining the layer-dependent bulk density, which was 0.77, 0.88, and 1.23 g cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> for the 0–0.10, 0.10–0.30, and 0.30–0.40 m depths of the CT plot, respectively, compared to 0.76, 0.77, and 0.58 g cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> for the 0–0.10, 0.10–0.20, and 0.20–0.40 m depths of the RT plot, respectively.
