<p class="p">In the experimental field located at the east of the RT plot, corn (
 <italic class="italic">Zea mays</italic> L.) was cultivated in summer in 2009 following the local conventional practice. After harvest in late August, 50 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> of ammonium sulphate was applied using a broadcaster to enhance corn residue decomposition. This field (approximate size, 1 ha) was maintained bare during winter and divided into two parts for a treatment (snow cover manipulation) and a control (ambient snow cover) plot. The snow cover compaction treatment was conducted twice a month during December 2009 and January 2010. The mean D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in the control and treatment plots was 0.03 m and 0.42 m, respectively. Soil core samples were collected from each plot from 0–1.0 m depth by using an engine-auger in late November and early April to estimate the nitrate content in the surface soil before snowfall and after snowmelt. The core sample was cut in 0.10 m-intervals in the field, and a portion of fresh soil samples was shaken with 2 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> of potassium chloride solution for 60 min to extract nitrate. The concentration of nitrate in the extract was determined, and the mean soil nitrate content (mg N kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> dry soil) for the 0.10-m thick soil was converted to the unit of kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> as described above. The bulk density of the control and treatment plots was assumed to be the same as 0.83, 1.01, 0.95, 0.67, 0.91, 1.15, 1.12, and 1.10 g cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup> for the 0–0.1, 0.1–0.2, 0.2–0.4, 0.4–0.5, 0.5–0.6, 0.6–0.7, 0.7–0.8, and 0.8–1.0 m depths, respectively.
