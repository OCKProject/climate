 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. For the statistical modelling, the reported numbers of remaining potato tubers after harvest and emergence of potato sprouts per unit square meter area (m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) were multiplied by 10,000, and then rounded off to the closest whole number to convert to the unit (ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and to an integer value (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). In addition, the year of study and snow cover manipulation treatment at the same field were regarded as an independent study plot. Next, because a potato tuber has 0, 1, or several sprouts, i.e. there is no upper limit for the numbers in the emerged sprouts, we assumed that the observed variation in the potato sprouts per hectare (

 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as the explanatory variable, and the number of unharvested potato tubers per hectare (
 <italic class="italic">Unharvested</italic>) as the offset term in the linear predictor. Subsequently, the log link function was applied (
