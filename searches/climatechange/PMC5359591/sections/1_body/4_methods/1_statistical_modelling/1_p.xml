<p class="p">The optimum soil frost depth was estimated by re-analysing published data regarding the emergence ratio of volunteer potatoes and snowmelt water infiltration to soil; further, an on-farm snow cover manipulation experiment was conducted to determine nitrate retention at the surface soil owing to deep soil frost penetration. To characterise the responses to the annual maximum soil frost depth (D
