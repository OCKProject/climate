 <sub class="sub">max</sub> that caused half retention of nitrate at the surface soil was estimated to be 0.42 and deeper than 0.32 m when considering the mean and 95% confidence interval, respectively. This high uncertainty of soil nitrate retention ratio likely reflects the large spatial variability of the amount of snowmelt infiltration depending on the microtopography of the ground surface. In addition, measured and modelled nitrate retention ratio of over 1.0 can suggest the presence of nitrate discharge. Nitrification can be thought to occur after snowmelt where deep soil frost development easily releases decomposable organic matter such as cellular components of microbes
