<p class="p">Considering the results of parameterisation on snow cover manipulation experiments as shown above and those obtained by agricultural/environmental implications, the optimum range of soil frost depth was suggested to be 0.28–0.33 m of D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as follows (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The shallow limit of the optimum D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (0.28 m) was relatively easy to determine by considering that it allowed the effective management of the emergence ratio of volunteer potatoes at around 0.01 or less. In this case, the infiltration ratio of snowmelt water was 0.53 and the nitrate retention ratio was 0.42. Conversely, another limit of optimum D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (0.33 m) was difficult to determine reasonably because the nitrate retention ratio had large uncertainty in response to the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. In addition, no exact thresholds were available to avoid flooding snowmelt water, soil erosion, and delaying agricultural activity initiation in response to the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. Therefore, in the present study, we proposed the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> limit to be simply the intersection point, i.e. 0.33 m (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), indicating that the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> balanced these two factors to avoid notable nitrate leaching. In this case, the infiltration ratio of snowmelt water was 0.35 and the nitrate retention was 0.51. Thus, we tentatively but quantitatively suggested the optimum range of the D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as 0.28–0.33 m based on these considerations to eradicate volunteer potato emergence while managing nitrate leaching and snow-melt water infiltration. Further implications of the optimum D
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> are discussed in the following section.
