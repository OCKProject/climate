  <p class="p">Satellite photographs of tidally-restricted wetlands on the U.S. Atlantic coast, demonstrating a range of histories, causes and sizes: (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The Herring River basin within the National Park Service Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts. The solid black outline indicates 4 km
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> of former tidal salt marsh. The estuary and marsh were diked in the first decade of the 20
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, in an unsuccessful attempt to control mosquitos. Portions of the basin are now
   <sup class="sup">
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
   </sup> drained marsh, and are characterized by acid-sulfate soil, loss of elevation, and colonization by native and non-native grass, shrub and trees. Other portions are impounded, freshened and colonized by native and non-native fresh and brackish wetland grasses. The wetland is proposed for tidal restoration, and pre-restoration carbon cycle and ecological data collections are underway. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) An impoundment on ~0.05 km
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> of former salt marsh on the south shore of Cape Cod, Massachusetts, caused by a 19
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> century railroad that was subsequently converted to a bicycle path. Similar incidental impoundments are common and widespread along coastal transportation corridors. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge in the state of Delaware. The Refuge is a 41 km
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> complex of managed wetland and open water. In response to repeated storm damage, plans were in development to upgrade the artificial berm that impounded 16 km
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> of freshwater impoundment (

Prior to completion of the upgrades, Hurricane Sandy breached the artificial berm in 2012 and restored saline tidal flows to the impoundment. Subsequently, deliberate salt marsh restorations were undertaken. The inadvertent breach likely resulted in significant GHG emission reductions.
