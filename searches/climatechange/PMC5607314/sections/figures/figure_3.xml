  <p class="p">Twenty-year cumulative radiative forcing (picowatt-years per m
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> of earth surface) due to net effect of carbon sequestration and methane emission in typical coastal wetlands and in hydrologically-altered wetlands. Radiative forcing is calculated per hectare (10

   <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of wetland, with continuous emissions over a 20-year period, based on emission factors provided in Table 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. As described in the text, scenarios were considered based on two emission factors for carbon dioxide in drained marsh and three emission factors for methane in freshened or impounded wetlands. Those EF are shown here as separate bars. For context, emissions in wetlands are compared to terrestrial forest C sequestration and to emissions from an automobile. RF from an automobile was calculated based on twenty years of tailpipe emissions from one U.S. automobile
