  <p class="p">Time-course of cumulative radiative forcing modeled as the difference between emissions under scenarios of no action and of restoration (TableÂ 
   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Negative values indicate cumulative climatic cooling (picowatt-years per m
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> of earth surface) per square meter of wetland restored, over a 30-year period (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) and a 200-year period (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>). Methane emission reductions due to tidal restoration in impounded (flooded and freshened) former salt marsh (panels a and d) result in large reduction in RF, particularly on a timescale of decades to a century. Carbon dioxide emission reductions due to rewetting of drained salt marsh (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) and terrestrial peatland (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) also have relatively large climate benefit, but depend on assumptions regarding the period of time that the wetland would have been maintained in a continuously drained condition, and the period of time that the finite carbon stock in the drained soil would continue to respire (uncertainty regarding timeframe of benefit indicated by dashed lines; see text).
