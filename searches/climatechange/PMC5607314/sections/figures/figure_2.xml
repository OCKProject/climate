  <p class="p">Conceptual model of carbon cycle processes and greenhouse gas flux changes in response to hydrological management in tidal wetlands. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) In unaltered, or successfully restored, salt marsh, sulfate ion inhibits methane emission, and high rates of net CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> uptake, soil C storage, and soil elevation gain occur. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Salt marsh drainage increases exposure of soil carbon stocks to oxygen, and results in a rapid rate of aerobic respiration to CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>, loss of carbon stock, and loss of elevation. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Impoundment commonly leads to freshening and increased water level, and those conditions are likely to cause an increase in methane emission. Effects of impoundment on soil carbon stocks and rate of soil carbon storage are not well-known, and herein rates are assumed to be similar to natural salt marsh.
