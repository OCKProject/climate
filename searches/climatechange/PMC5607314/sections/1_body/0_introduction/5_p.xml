 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions in low salinity tidal wetlands, and therefore expected range of emissions and EF in freshened, impounded wetlands, we modeled the time course of RF using three different CH

 </sup> at salinity &lt;18, as well as the IPCC EF for low salinity tidal wetlands. The wide range in literature estimates for CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions in low salinity tidal wetlands is likely due to variations across sites in other drivers of emissions, including water level, plant productivity and temperature. Therefore, it is important to examine a range of EF for these low salinity wetlands, to represent the diversity of emissions. For CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> EF in drained and rewetted terrestrial and tidal wetlands, we used IPCC Tier 1 EF from drained and rewetted inland organic soils and tidal wetlands. Note that there is uncertainty regarding the length of time over which the high rate of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission will occur following drainage. The duration will depend in part on the depth of drainage and whether further, deeper drainage occurs following initial drainage

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> EF. EF1 assumed that drainage-associated respiration had gone to completion during decades to centuries of drainage, and current and future drainage-associated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission is zero. EF2 assumed that C stocks were not depleted, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emission continued over the time period of analysis.
