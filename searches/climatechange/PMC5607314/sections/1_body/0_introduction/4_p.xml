<p id="Par5" class="p">To examine the intensity of GHG emissions due to tidal restriction in salt marshes, as well as the potential for emissions reductions through tidal restoration, we modeled resulting changes over time in the cumulative mass of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emitted or sequestered, and their radiative forcing (RF, a measure of the change in energy in the global atmosphere). The concepts around changes in soil C stocks and in GHG emissions with impoundment or drainage of salt marsh, and with restoration of tidal flows, are diagramed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>. Here, “tidal restoration” describes removal or opening of dikes, tide gates, or under-sized culverts to renew tidal water exchange between the salt marsh and coastal ocean, and thus restore natural, or nearer to natural, water level and salinity. We first compared the intensity, per unit area, of cooling (net negative RF) in natural Blue Carbon ecosystems (seagrass beds, salt marshes and mangroves) to intensity of warming due to enhanced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in impounded and drained salt marsh, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). As further context, we also modeled: climatic cooling (negative RF) from net C storage in U.S. forests; warming (positive RF) from tailpipe emissions of a typical U.S. automobile; and warming (positive RF) from enhanced CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in drained, terrestrial peatlands. We utilized RF calculations in this study to enable comparison of the climatic impact of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions or emissions reductions that are sustained over a period of decades to centuries. Use of standard global warming potentials (GWP) to compare the impact of different GHG is not appropriate in the context of sustained emissions that are characteristic of ecosystems and their management

 </sup>. Rather, standard GWP calculations are intended as a policy tool based on analysis of the atmospheric perturbation lifetime of a discrete pulse of GHG emission. Standard GWP calculations underestimate the climatic impact of sustained CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions or emissions reductions relative to sustained changes in CO
