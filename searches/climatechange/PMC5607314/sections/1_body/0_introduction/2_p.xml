<p id="Par3" class="p">Commonly, however, tidal exchange of saline water between the coastal ocean and emergent, tidal wetlands, including salt marshes and mangroves (herein referred to as “tidal wetlands”), has been blocked or restricted by human activity, and those alterations can dramatically freshen and degrade the ecosystem

 </sup>. Both drainage and impoundment of tidal wetlands have been practiced for a wide range of purposes during the past several centuries of human civilization

 </sup>. Blockage or restriction of tidal flows, through installation of dikes or tide gates, is a common method to protect coastal infrastructure; to drain tidal wetlands for farming, mosquito control, and development; or to raise or manage water tables and reduce salinity for aquaculture, mosquito control, rice production, and wildfowl management. Inadvertent tidal restrictions also occur due to road, railroad and other infrastructure development, with affected wetlands landward of transportation corridors often becoming freshened and flooded due to retention of freshwater drainage from the watershed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. As a result of those many causes for complete or partial tidal restriction in tidal wetlands, inhabited and developed coastal landscapes typically contain a patchwork of unaltered tidal wetlands interspersed with drained, impounded, and partially restricted wetlands, ranging in size from &lt;0.1 km

 </sup>, but rather as fresh or brackish ponds or wetlands where impounded, or, where drained, former wetland may appear as woodland, shrubland, developed land, or agricultural land.
