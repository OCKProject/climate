<p id="Par9" class="p">There is substantial potential for GHG reductions based on the intensity of emissions, and on the areal extent of tidally-restricted wetlands in developed landscapes. Tidally-restricted wetlands are widespread throughout the inhabited world (e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>). Infrastructure and activities that alter wetland and coastal hydrology have been closely associated with intensity of human development and economic activity in terrestrial and marine portions of the coastal landscape
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>, and therefore are expected to increase in the future, particularly in portions of the world that are undergoing rapid development
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. Quantitative geographical data on tidally-restricted wetlands are limited, and indeed the global area of tidal wetlands as a whole is not well-constrained
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, it is not possible to estimate global scale GHG emissions due to restrictions. As an indication of scale, we used mapped and areal data along portions of the U.S. Atlantic coast on managed impoundments and on incidental impoundments associated with transportation infrastructure. The analysis resulted in an estimate that those tidal restrictions have caused a reduction in salinity, and enhancement of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, in approximately 27% of tidal wetlands on the U.S. Atlantic coast (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The impoundment and freshening result in enhanced CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions in the range of 28,000 to 145,000 tonnes (t) CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. It is worth emphasizing once again that these are sustained emissions, and thus RF due to those rates of continuous emission over a 20-year period are equivalent to 20 years of continuous emissions from 0.6 to 3.1 million automobiles (see Methods). Note that this is an estimate of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions alone, and does not consider changes in C sequestration rate in soil, nor loss of existing soil C stocks and enhanced soil CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions, due to changes in water level and salinity. Further, the area and emissions calculations consider only the effect of freshening and impoundment of tidal wetlands, and do not include area or emissions of tidal wetlands that have been drained, unintentionally nor intentionally, for purposes such as agriculture or land development.
