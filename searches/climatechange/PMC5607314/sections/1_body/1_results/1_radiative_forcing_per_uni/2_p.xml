 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). We compared climatic cooling due to tidal restoration to cooling from other wetland carbon management options, including creation of new salt marsh or sea grass beds as biological C sequestration projects, and to rewetting of terrestrial peatland to cease the high rate of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from drained peatland soils. In general, the tidal restorations in salt marshes, to restore natural salinity and water levels, will be dramatically more effective at cooling climate than other wetland-based climate change interventions (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> production in previously flooded and freshened soils (Fig.

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> production in previously drained soils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b,e</xref>) indicate sizeable, rapid and sustained climatic cooling. Despite the high rate of C sequestration in salt marshes and mangroves, building and planting of new marsh, mangrove or seagrass bed, provides relatively modest climatic cooling (Fig.
