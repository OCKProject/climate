<p id="Par7" class="p">Results indicate that climatic warming, or positive RF, due to tidal restriction (both impoundment and drainage) is large on a per unit area basis relative to the magnitude of cooling from C sequestration in forests and in unaltered coastal wetlands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). For instance, over a period of 20 years following initial alteration, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from an impounded and freshened salt marsh can result in a cumulative RF that is a factor of ~3 to 20 greater than the magnitude of climatic cooling due to net C stock increase in continental U.S. forests and to soil C sequestration in unaltered salt marsh, and a factor of 1.5 to 10 greater than sequestration in natural mangrove. Over those 20 years, CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from one hectare of impounded wetland are equivalent to RF from 20 years of continuous tailpipe emissions of 1.7 to 6.3 automobiles (Fig.
