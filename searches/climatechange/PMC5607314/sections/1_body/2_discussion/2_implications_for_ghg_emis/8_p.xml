<p id="Par21" class="p">There is significant potential for C and GHG management in coastal wetlands, but continued advances are needed on the scientific basis for policy frameworks and for quantification of emission factors in response to management actions. There has been particularly little study of changes in soil and biomass C stocks, and of GHG fluxes, in response to tidal restriction and tidal restoration in salt marshes and mangroves. Further, in all areas of the world the state of knowledge is poor regarding the geographic distribution of tidal wetlands, of salinity within those wetlands, of occurrence of tidally-restricted salt marshes and mangroves, and of the potential for tidal restoration. The findings presented here therefore suggest a research agenda to study GHG emissions and the fate of carbon stocks in natural, restricted and restored wetlands, across geographic settings, as well as mapping occurrence and characteristics of tidal wetlands and tidally-restricted wetlands.</p>
