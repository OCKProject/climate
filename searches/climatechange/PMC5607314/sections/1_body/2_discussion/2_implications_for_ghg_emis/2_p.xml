<p id="Par15" class="p">Wetland C and GHG management can also play a role as an additional method for reducing regional, state and local GHG emissions, including through regulatory or voluntary carbon markets or cap &amp; trade programs. Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) has developed a Methodology for crediting tidal wetland carbon offset projects, designed for both voluntary and regulatory C markets worldwide, and within that methodology there is accommodation for avoided CH
