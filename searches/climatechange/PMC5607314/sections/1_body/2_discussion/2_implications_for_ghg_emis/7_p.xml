<p id="Par20" class="p">In other circumstances, the decisions may be less complicated in terms of tradeoffs of services, such as where tidal restriction is due to inadvertent, transportation-related obstruction of flow, and thus there is no current beneficial use of the impaired wetland (for example, see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). In some cases, ecosystem restoration through opening of tidal restrictions can be consistent with coastal resilience planning, since exposure to tidal flow will tend to promote resumption of natural accretion of wetland elevation in response to sea level rise, resulting in enhanced protection of the infrastructure landward of the wetland.
