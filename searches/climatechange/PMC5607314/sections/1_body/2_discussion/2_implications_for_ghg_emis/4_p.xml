 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions vs. creation and planting of new salt marsh to enhance C sequestration), the range of CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emission factors would result in a calculated GHG reduction benefit for avoided CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (scenario 1) that is similar to the C sequestration benefit in scenario 3 (scenario 1 = 0.7 to 3.5 times the value of scenario 3; not shown). The ratio would remain constant for the 100-year lifetime of the projects. That result is in contrast to the more nuanced calculation of change in radiative forcing that we noted previously in the manuscript, in which reduction in RF (cooling) due to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) was a factor of 12 to 59 greater than RF reduction due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration in new salt marsh (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>), at 15 years post restoration. Even at 100 years post restoration, the benefit of avoided CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions (scenario 1) remains a factor of 3 to 11 greater (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4d and f</xref>). As noted previously, a standard GWP approach is inappropriate for sustained emissions or sinks that are typical of ecosystems

 </sup>. A 100-year GWP that is calculated based on simulation of a single pulse of CH
