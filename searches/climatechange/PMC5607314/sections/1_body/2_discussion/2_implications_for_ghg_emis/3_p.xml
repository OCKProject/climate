<p id="Par16" class="p">First, at present, in the VCS methodology, there must be reasonable expectation that a wetlands-based, emissions offset project will have a lifetime of at least 100 years. The mandated lifetime is in response to the concept that in projects that promote C sequestration in soil or biomass, the sequestered C must be kept out of the atmosphere for an extended time to have significant climate change mitigation value. However, in the context of avoided CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions, the 100-year time frame is arbitrary, since such offset projects do not rely on storage of C in a soil or biomass reservoir, and they accrue considerable, long-term and quantifiable mitigation benefit on timeframes of decades. Given that the persistence of any project for 100 years is difficult to assure, a shortened minimum lifetime for avoided CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> projects could increase utilization of tidal wetlands as offset projects.
