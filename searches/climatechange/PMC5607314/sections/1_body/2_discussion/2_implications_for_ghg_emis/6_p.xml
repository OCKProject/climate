<p id="Par19" class="p">Finally, beyond C markets and national GHG inventories, awareness of anthropogenic emissions in tidally-restricted wetlands, and the potential for mitigation through ecosystem restoration, may be of significant value to land management agencies with wetlands, tidal impoundments, and coastal infrastructure under their purview, such as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, local and state government entities, and private land owners. In wetlands that are intentionally managed, in many cases opening tidal restrictions would be prohibited by ongoing important land uses, or where restoration would put developed land at risk of flooding. But, increasingly, decisions are being forced, by accelerating sea level rise and increasing storm intensity, regarding whether to spend resources to preserve and upgrade aging dikes and tide gates that maintain wetlands in drained or impounded condition (for example see Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1c</xref>, Prime Hook NWR). Management decisions and objectives are based in part on anticipated changes in the value of ecosystem services to society, including coastal protection, quality and type of habitat, recreational utility, and others. Reduction in GHG emissions has significant value to society, and can be highlighted as a benefit, regardless of whether the benefit is monetized. Even where opening tidal restrictions is contraindicated, there still may be potential for management of water levels and salinity at targeted times of the year, specifically for the purpose of reducing GHG emissions and promoting C sequestration, while maintaining utility of the landscape for those other uses or protecting infrastructure from flooding.
