<p id="Par10" class="p">The results of this study indicate that, despite a high rate of C sequestration in coastal wetlands, in many cases tidal restoration in salt marshes will have dramatically greater potential per unit area as a climate change intervention than the other examined ecosystem management actions. Coupled with the common, widespread occurrence of tidal restrictions, there is significant potential for GHG emissions reductions through tidal restoration in salt marshes. Though we did not address tidal restriction and restoration in mangroves, many of the processes and rates presented for salt marshes would be expected to be similar in mangroves. We further note that avoiding tidal restrictions with future coastal development would have similar and perhaps greater benefits in terms of avoided GHG emissions than the restoration scenarios examined in this study. Here we discuss several features of tidal restoration, and particularly avoided methane emissions, that highlight further advantages relative to enhanced CO
