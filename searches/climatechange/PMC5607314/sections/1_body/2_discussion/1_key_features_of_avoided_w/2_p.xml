 </sup>. In the present study, ecosystem recovery was represented as a lag of 5 years prior to onset of the full rate of C sequestration in salt marsh soil (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, note 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>). Thus, climatic cooling due to avoided CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions is relatively large on short timescales. In contrast, in projects that promote biological C sequestration in wetland soil, or similarly in forest biomass, accrual of climate change mitigation benefits is a process of gradual accumulation on a timescale of centuries (see “New salt marsh” curve in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c and f</xref>), due to both the gradual rate of ecosystem development following restoration, and to the modest radiative efficiency of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, coupled with a long atmospheric perturbation lifetime. As a result, at 15 years post restoration, for instance, negative RF (cooling) due to CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>) was a factor of 12 to 59 greater than that due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration in new salt marsh (Fig.
