 <italic class="italic">Malva parviflora</italic> L. (Malvaceae) at the Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria (25°45′03.6″S 28°15′28.9″E; Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa) in June 2009. Viviparous, parthenogenetic 
 <italic class="italic">M. euphorbiae</italic> were reared on potato plants (cv. BP1, G0 mini tubers; Rascal Seeds Research Laboratory and Potato Seed Production) and maintained in wooden sleeve cages (55 × 42 × 56 cm) in an environment-controlled room at 25 ± 5 °C, 14 L: 10D photoperiod and current humidity. Light was provided by a combination of Cool White (L30W/640, Osram, Germany) and Fluora (L30W/77, Osram, Germany) fluorescent tubes. The aphid culture was maintained for six months before individuals were used in experiments.
