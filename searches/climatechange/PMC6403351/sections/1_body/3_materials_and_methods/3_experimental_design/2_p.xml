<p id="Par33" class="p">A temperature and humidity logger (iButton, Hydrochron Temperature/Humidity Logger, FairBridge Technologies, Sandton, South Africa) was placed in each glass cage within each growth chamber to measure the temperature and humidity at hourly intervals. The mean ( ± SD) temperature in the glass cages was 23.2 ± 2.0 °C during the day and 15.8 ± 2.5 °C at night for the current temperature treatment. The mean temperature for the elevated temperature regime was 27.5 ± 2.7 °C during the day and 20.0 ± 2.3 °C at night.</p>
