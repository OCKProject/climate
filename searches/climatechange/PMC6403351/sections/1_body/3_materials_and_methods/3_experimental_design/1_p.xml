<p id="Par32" class="p">Preconditioned 60-day old potato plants were transferred to ventilated glass cages (25 × 25 × 25 cm). Four glass cages containing a single potato plant were placed in each of four growth chambers. In each incubator three of the four potato plants were used to determine the life-history traits of 
 <italic class="italic">M. euphorbiae</italic>, and the fourth plant without aphids served to measure stomatal conductance. Each growth chamber simulated different environmental conditions. Two growth chambers each were kept at daily cycles of 25/15 °C day-night temperatures and two growth chambers at daily cycles of 30/20 °C day-night temperatures and 14 L: 10D photoperiod and ambient humidity. The change between day-night temperatures occurred gradually within approximately 30 minutes. Light in each growth chamber was provided by six fluorescent tubes (Cool White L18W/640, Osram, Germany). New tubes were fitted in all growth chambers at the beginning of the experiment in order to standardize light intensity (c. 4880 lux light intensity inside glass cage). At each temperature water-deficit stress (25–30% pot capacity) and well-watered (80–100% pot capacity) regimes were applied to the potato plants in separate incubators. The relative humidity ranged between 35% and 40% for all growth chambers despite efforts to increase relative humidity in the well-watered treatments. The experiment was replicated three times for each temperature and water regime.
