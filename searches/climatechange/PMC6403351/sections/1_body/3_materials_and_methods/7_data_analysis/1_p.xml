<p id="Par37" class="p">Data were tested for normality and homogeneity of variances. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test for differences between leaf area after experiments with temperature and water regime and their interaction as fixed effects. Linear mixed model repeated measurement analysis (REML)

 </sup> was used to analyse stomatal conductance over 42 days. The fixed effects were specified as day, water, temperature, and all possible interactions, while random effects were specified as trial and trial × treatment and trial × treatment × day interactions. A second-order autoregressive model (AR 2) best modelled the correlation over days. Due to unequal samples sizes (unbalanced design) nymphal development time, adult lifespan, daily reproduction, fecundity and life-table parameters were analysed using linear mixed model analysis (REML) with water, temperature and water × temperature as fixed effects and trial, trial × treatment and trial × treatment × cage as random effects. Where differences between treatments were significant, Fisher’s protected least significant difference (LSD) test was used to separate means. Survival analyses were carried out to test for differences in nymphal survival (survival from newly born nymphs to adults) as well as adult survival between different treatments using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test for overall and pairwise comparisons. The significance level was set at P &lt; 0.05 for all analyses. Data were analysed with GenStat®
