<p id="Par34" class="p">To obtain first-instar nymphs, one adult aptera (wingless) 
 <italic class="italic">M. euphorbiae</italic> was confined to one potato leaf in a mesh-covered clip-on leaf cage with an inside diameter of 1.8 cm and height of 1.5 cm. Six leaf cages containing one aphid each, facing the abaxial surface, were attached to six separate leaves on a potato plant for each treatment. Viviparous adult aphids were allowed to deposit first-instar nymphs for 24 h, after which the adult and all but one first-instar nymph were removed from the potato leaf. The single first-instar nymph was confined to the abaxial surface of a potato leaf in a new clip-on leaf cage. Six clip-on leaf cages with one nymph each were used per plant. Individual nymphs were observed once daily for moulting and survival until the last individual from each treatment moulted into the adult stage. The presence of exuviae was used to determine moulting. When calculating development times, nymphs were considered to be 24 h old when the experiment was initiated. Total nymphal development and instar-specific nymphal development duration in days were determined.
