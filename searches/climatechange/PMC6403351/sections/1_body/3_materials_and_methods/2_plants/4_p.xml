 </sup> were chosen for the experiments. Prior to pre-conditioning of plants, leaves from a randomly selected subsample of potato plants were harvested and measured with a LI-3100C Leaf Area Meter (LI-COR, Lincoln, Nebraska, U.S.A.). There was no significant difference in the total leaf area between subsamples of plants assigned to different treatments (analysis of variance (ANOVA), treatment: F
