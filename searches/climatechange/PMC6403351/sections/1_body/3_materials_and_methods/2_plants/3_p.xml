<p id="Par28" class="p">In addition to the two temperature regimes, two different water regimes were applied to the potato plants during the pre-conditioning phase. Moderate water-deficit stress was induced by maintaining the soil at 25–30% pot capacity. For the well-watered treatment, soil was maintained at 80–100% pot capacity. Increase in the weight of pots due to plant growth was not determined, i.e. plants became more water stressed over time. The initial pot capacity of the soil was calculated by weighing oven-dried soil and water-saturated soil in a pot with an Adam QBW - 15 scale (Adam Equipment Co. Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK). The soil was oven dried at 60 °C for 24 h before weighing. Thereafter it was watered until saturated, and the mass of dry soil subtracted from saturated soil mass to determine the mass of water needed to saturate the soil (100% pot capacity) in the pots. This process was replicated three times for each temperature treatment. To saturate dry soil in the pots (12.5 cm diameter, 9.5 cm), an amount of 180 g of water was required to obtain 100% pot capacity whereas 45 g was needed to maintain plants at 25% pot capacity. Each pot with potato plants was weighed every other day to determine the mass of water needed to obtain either 100% pot capacity (well watered) or 25% pot capacity (water-deficit stress).</p>
