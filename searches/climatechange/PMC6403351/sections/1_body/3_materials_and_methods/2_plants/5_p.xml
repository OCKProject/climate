 </sup>. Stomatal conductance of one plant (control plant) for each replicate and treatment was measured with a hand held Decagon Leaf Porometer Model SC-1 (Version 1.31, Decagon Devices, Campbell Scientific Africa, Stellenbosch, South Africa). The sensor head was calibrated to adjust to the experimental environment according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions every time before taking measurements for a specific treatment. Measurements of abaxial conductance were taken daily for 42 days during the day time light setting from fully expanded terminal leaflets (two top, two middle and two bottom leaves) of each control plant. Measurements were taken from six randomly selected leaflets per plant to account for variation, e.g. exposure to light, leaf age, position, in order to determine a daily mean value for each plant and treatment throughout the experiment. Each treatment was replicated three times.
