<p id="Par20" class="p">Potato plants are considered to be sensitive to water-deficit stress. Different physiological processes, such as transpiration and photosynthesis, can be inhibited or completely stopped because even at low levels of water-deficit stress, potato plants close their stomata

In contrast to our prediction aphid performance was not enhanced by water stress, possibly because leaf nitrogen concentrations did not increase. The results contradict the plant stress hypothesis
