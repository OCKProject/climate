<p id="Par24" class="p">In conclusion, our study provides insights into the impact of moderate water-deficit stress during heat waves on phloem-feeding insects. Moderate water-deficit stress during high day-night temperatures reduced aphid survival but had little effect on aphid population growth parameters of those aphids that reached maturity. Yet, reduced aphid survival and reproduction suggest that 
 <italic class="italic">M. euphorbiae</italic> populations could be negatively affected during heat waves, particularly when combined with drought stress, which reduced aphid survival further. Drought and heat waves frequently occur together, and their combined impact on plant - insect herbivore interactions is complex. The study highlights the importance of studying multiple stressors in combination in order to improve our understanding on their effect on plant-insect herbivore interactions in the context of climate change.
