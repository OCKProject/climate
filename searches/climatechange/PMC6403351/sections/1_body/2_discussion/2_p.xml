 </sup>. In addition, single and combined stressors may affect nymphs and adults differently. Unlike nymphs, where heat and water stress interactively reduced their survival, the reproduction of aphids that survived to adulthood was affected differently by single stressors than by their interaction. Water stress and high temperatures separately reduced the number of daily offspring but there was no interaction between the two stressors.
