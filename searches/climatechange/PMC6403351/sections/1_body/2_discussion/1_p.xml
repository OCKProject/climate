 <italic class="italic">M</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">euphorbiae</italic> depended on temperature. Continuous moderate water-deficit stress at high day-night temperatures (30/20 °C) reduced nymphal survival and added to the negative impact of heat stress, whereas water stress had no effect on their survival at current day-night temperatures (25/15 °C). Furthermore, the effect of temperature depended on the water level. Adult survival was reduced only when heat and water stress were combined but not by heat stress alone.
