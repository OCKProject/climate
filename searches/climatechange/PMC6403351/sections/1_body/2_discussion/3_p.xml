<p id="Par18" class="p">Aphid reproduction and population growth during heat waves, and even more so when combined with drought, are likely to decrease if the number of nymphs surviving to maturity is reduced. This agrees with a model on the effect of future warming on the abundance of the peach-potato aphid

 </sup>. The model predicts an increase of 1.9 °C over a 90-year period from 1961 to 2050 in interior potato-producing regions of South Africa resulting in reduced aphid population growth in regions where aphids may reach their thermal limits during the hottest months
