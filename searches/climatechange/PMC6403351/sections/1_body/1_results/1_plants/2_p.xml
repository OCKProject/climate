<p id="Par11" class="p">Stomatal conductance (mmol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) was determined daily as an indirect measure of water stress (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Over a 42-day period stomatal conductance (mean ± SE) was significantly influenced by water level (F = 99.62, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 5.8, P &lt; 0.001). The stomatal conductance for the two temperatures was significantly lower for water-stressed (11.97 ± 0.38) compared to well-watered plants (28.22 ± 0.68). Neither temperature (F = 0.46, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 5.8, P = 0.523) nor any of the interactions with the exception of day and the day x water interaction influenced stomatal conductance over the 42-day period (day: F = 2.85, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 41, 63.3, P &lt; 0. 0001, day x water: F = 1.58, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 41, 63.3, P = 0.049; n = 42). Leaf nitrogen concentrations did not differ significantly between temperature and water level, nor was the interaction significant (Supplementary Table
