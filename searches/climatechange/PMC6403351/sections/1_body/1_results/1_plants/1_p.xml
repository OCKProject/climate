<p id="Par10" class="p">Plants were maintained at current (25/15 °C) and high (30/20 °C) day-night temperatures on either moderately water deficit-stressed (25–30% pot capacity) or well-watered (80–100% pot capacity) potato plants (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The leaf area was reduced on average by 28% at high temperatures (mean ± SE; 163.82 ± 15.43) compared to plants kept at current temperatures (228.09 ± 18.42; F
