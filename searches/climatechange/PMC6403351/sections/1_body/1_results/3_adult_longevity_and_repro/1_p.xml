<p id="Par14" class="p">Temperature and water regime did not influence the duration of the pre-reproductive, the reproductive and the post-reproductive periods or adult longevity, nor were the interactions significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The daily and total number of offspring produced were significantly lower on plants at high day-night temperatures than at current day-night temperatures (daily reproduction: F = 42.42, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 22.8, P &lt; 0.001; total fecundity: F = 9.18, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 5.2, P = 0.028). The total number of offspring produced at high temperatures was on average 43% lower than at current temperatures. Water stress reduced daily (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A–D</xref>) but not total reproduction (daily reproduction: F = 5.03, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 32.1, P = 0.035). Interactions between temperature and water level for daily and total fecundity were not significant.
