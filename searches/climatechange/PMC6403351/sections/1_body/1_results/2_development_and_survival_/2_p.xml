<p id="Par13" class="p">For nymphs that survived to adulthood instar-specific development time and development time from birth to fourth-instar nymph did not differ between treatments. Interactions between temperature and water regime were not significant except for the development time of the third-instar nymph which was longer on water-stressed plants at high temperatures compared to well-watered and water-stressed plants at current temperatures (F = 5.84, n.d.f, d.d.f. = 1, 153.3, P = 0.017; Table
