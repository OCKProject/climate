<p id="Par2" class="p">Understanding the impact of changing climatic conditions on the ecology and evolution of animals and plants has been central to recent research efforts. Global average surface temperature is predicted to increase by 1.5 to 4.5 °C by the end of the 21

 </sup>. Due to this increase, major variability in climatic conditions could occur which includes more frequent droughts and higher mid-summer temperatures

 </sup>. Of particular relevance is how climate change will affect disease and pest outbreaks as this is of direct concern to human health and food production. Several aphid species cause direct feeding damage and transmit plant diseases to crops. They are ideal study organisms for determining the effects of global warming due to their short development times and high reproductive capacity
