<p class="p">Identification and classification of programmes involved several strategies, similar to the approach outlined by Mews et al. [
 <xref rid="CIT0070" class="xref">76</xref>], in which data were collected through secondary sources such as consulting with relevant stakeholders, targeted internet searches and reviewing grey and peer-reviewed literature. Specifically, this environmental scan involved the following four strategies to identify programmes that met the above criterion:

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Consultation with academic researchers working on community-led monitoring in the North during September-December 2017</italic>: In public health research, consultations have been used in the search phase of reviews to help develop key search terms, and identify relevant resources, as well as to validate and augment review findings, providing a more nuanced, robust and useful understanding of collected data [
    <xref rid="CIT0074" class="xref">80</xref>,
    <xref rid="CIT0075" class="xref">81</xref>]. In this study, this method involved informal discussions with researchers to catalogue existing monitoring programmes in the North, as well as attending two workshops on community-based monitoring (
    <italic class="italic">The Community Based Monitoring Experience and Exchange Workshop</italic>, December 2017; and 
    <italic class="italic">The Community-Based Climate Change/Environmental Monitoring Workshop</italic>, February 2018), with participants from Northern Canada and the USA. These consultations provided information regarding monitoring programmes to include in the study, as well as resources to help identify other programmes.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Online searches of grey literature</italic>: Between September to December 2017 grey literature was searched, including: project, research, and annual reports; conference proceedings; news articles; working papers; and webpages related to CBM programmes that fit the outlined criterion. Grey literature was searched using Google as the main search engine. Search terms used included combinations of words such as: community-based monitoring, Indigenous communities and web technology (
    <xref rid="T0001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Additionally, programmes were identified through the 
    <italic class="italic">Atlas of Community-Based Monitoring and Indigenous Knowledge in a Changing Arctic</italic>.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Additional grey-literature search for mobile-phone applications</italic>: Owing to the dearth of monitoring programmes using mobile applications throughout the Circumpolar North, a secondary grey-literature search for global monitoring mobile applications was conducted, using Google as the primary search engine. This secondary grey-literature search provided broader data from which to draw key insights and lessons regarding mobile application use in the context of environment-health monitoring.

   <p class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Systematic scoping review of peer-reviewed articles</italic>: A systematic scoping review of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted [
    <xref rid="CIT0076" class="xref">82</xref>,
    <xref rid="CIT0077" class="xref">83</xref>]. This involved developing a search string, with the guidance of a research librarian, to search MEDLINE® and Web of Science™ (Appendix 1) to identify potentially relevant citations. The search was conducted in July 2015 and then again in June 2017. A hand search of three key journals (
    <italic class="italic">International Journal of Circumpolar Health, Arctic</italic>, and 
    <italic class="italic">Environmental Health Perspectives</italic>) was performed in June 2017. Citations were uploaded into Mendeley© and de-duplicated, and then uploaded into Distiller software©. Using Distiller©, a two-stage screening process was conducted to identify relevant articles. First, two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of each citation for relevance; potentially relevant citations proceeded to the second stage, where the full-text of the article was screened for relevance again by two independent reviewers. Inclusion criteria were identified a priori, and articles were included if they: were published in English between 2000–2016; were a primary or secondary study; were conducted in the Arctic or Subarctic; involved some form of environmental monitoring; and included some form of human health monitoring. A secondary screening was then conducted of the eligible articles, searching for CBM programmes that used technology to collect, share or visualise data; articles that met this criterion were then included in this study (
    <xref rid="F0001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). The level of agreement between the two independent reviewers was measured using Cohen’s Kappa (κ). Conflicts between reviewers were discussed and reconciled regularly throughout the review process.

   <p class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Additional peer-reviewed literature search for specific monitoring programme</italic>: To supplement the formal systematic scoping review, an additional search of peer-reviewed literature was used to find out more information about programmes identified from the grey literature review and to identify additional monitoring programmes that were active from September-December 2017. To conduct this search, each programme name identified through the grey literature review was used as a search term to search Primo Central
    <sup class="sup">TM</sup> – a search engine of online databases – for associated peer-reviewed articles, with no date restrictions on the search. This method allowed for greater insight and context into the various monitoring programmes, such as details on the methods used to select indicators.
