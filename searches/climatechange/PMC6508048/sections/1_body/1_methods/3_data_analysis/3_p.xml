<p class="p">To analyse the types of data recorded by monitoring programmes, the indicators monitored (eg water quality, etc.) were listed in a separate database, and divided into emergent categories (eg aquatic, etc.). The frequency of an indicator across monitoring programmes and the number of indicators for each programme were recorded, as well as the most common indicators in each category, and any categories for which indicators were underrepresented or not accounted.</p>
