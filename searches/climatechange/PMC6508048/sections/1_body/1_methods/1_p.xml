<p class="p">To identify environment-health monitoring programmes that worked with Indigenous communities and used some form of technology (eg tech-based platforms, software, mobile applications, etc.), a review of community-based monitoring in the Circumpolar North was conducted using an environmental scanning approach to systematically identify and consolidate information from a variety of sources [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>]. An environmental scanning approach is often used in the context of needs assessments and health programming, and can be implemented to explore and contextualise specific environments and identify areas in need of improvement [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0068" class="xref">74</xref>]. Environmental scans have been used by other researchers in the Circumpolar North [
 <xref rid="CIT0069" class="xref">75</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0073" class="xref">79</xref>], and are recognised as a responsive and cost-effective tool for public health research [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>]. This approach involves examining multiple sources of data (eg reviews of unpublished reports, consultation with community leaders, surveys, analysis of publicly available information, targeted internet searches of known programmes, peer-reviewed literature, etc.), and can target different populations, subjects or types of knowledge [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0068" class="xref">74</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0070" class="xref">76</xref>]. Owing to this flexibility, responsiveness and adaptability, there is no determined overarching framework for environmental scans; however, a common outcome of this approach is the ability to identify areas in need of improvement within a specific community or region based on available information [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>]. As CBM in the Circumpolar North continues to expand, this approach proved useful in this review of existing programmes in the region.
