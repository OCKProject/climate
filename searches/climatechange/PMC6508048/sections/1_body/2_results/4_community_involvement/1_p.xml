<p class="p">Although all of the monitoring programmes analysed reported some level of community involvement, the degree to which community members were involved in monitoring efforts varied, and few community-
 <italic class="italic">led</italic> monitoring programmes were identified. Programmes ranged from being developed and implemented by community members (eg eNuk, ISR-CBMP and PISUNA), to outside organisations consulting with community members (eg SmartICE, and NCAMP), to community members involved in the data collection phases of programmes (eg CBWMN and CEMP). Of the 21 monitoring programmes analysed, less than a quarter were classified as community-led (n = 5). The remaining programmes either partnered with communities (n = 6) or engaged with communities in another way (n = 7) (eg consultation or data collection).
