<p class="p">Although involving community members in monitoring is an integral part of CBM, aside from the three global-monitoring apps – which allowed anyone who had access to a mobile-phone to collect data – the majority of programmes were not open to the public and dedicated monitors were selected. These monitors often included: harvesters (ie hunters and fishers) (eg CBWMN, CONAS, ISR-CBMP, PISUNA and SIKU); Elders (eg CONAS); local experts (ie sea ice and wildlife experts) (eg ABEKS and SIZONet); and trained community members (eg CBWMN, CONAS and MWSP).</p>
