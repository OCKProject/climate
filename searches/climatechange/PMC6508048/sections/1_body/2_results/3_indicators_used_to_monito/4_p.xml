<p class="p">The majority of monitoring programmes with specified indicators focused exclusively on environmental change, with only seven out of 20 (35%) focusing on the impacts of climate change on human health: The Arctic Borderlands Ecological Knowledge Society; Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme; Circumpolar Biodiversity Monitoring Programme; Community-Based Wildlife Monitoring Network; Inuvialuit Settlement Region Community Based Monitoring Program; ISeeChange; and the LEO Network. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme monitored the greatest number of indicators related to human health (n = 4), including: consumption/harvest of traditional food, common causes of death, infant mortality and contaminants in humans. The remaining three Circumpolar programmes monitored consumption/harvest of traditional food as the sole indicator of human health, while the two global monitoring apps allowed users to input any observations related to human health. Notably, mental wellness was not explicitly monitored in any of the listed indicators; however, the eNuk Program, whose indicators were not yet published at the time of this review, was conceptualised as an integrated environment-health monitoring programme with the goal of monitoring a range of environmental conditions and both physical and mental health indicators.</p>
