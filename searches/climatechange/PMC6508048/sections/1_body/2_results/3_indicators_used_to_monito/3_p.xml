<p class="p">Of the 74 identified indicators/categories (
 <xref rid="T0004" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), the most commonly monitored were: ice thickness, wildlife distribution, wildlife abundance/population, changing fish distribution, change in water level/flooding, change in wildlife migration, consumption/harvest of traditional food, sea-ice extent, timing of ice freeze-up/break-up, snow depth/duration and air temperature (
 <xref rid="F0002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Many of the monitoring programmes explicitly monitored indicators associated with different and changing seasons (eg timing of ice freeze-up/break-up); however, not all monitoring programmes explicitly stated whether or not monitoring occurred year-round.
