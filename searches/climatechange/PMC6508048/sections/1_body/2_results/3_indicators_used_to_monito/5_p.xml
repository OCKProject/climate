<p class="p">There were a number of reported outcomes and outputs from these monitoring programmes. First, several of the organisations reported using the data to inform community, regional, and national decision-making (eg CBWMN, CONAS, ISR CBMP, NCP, PISUNA and SmartICE). For example, data collected through PISUNA were submitted to local authorities and central governments to take action and inform regional management decisions, such as changes to harvesting seasons, quotas and local laws and bylaws related to fishing methods and equipment [

Second, programmes reported using the information to develop tools for data sharing, education, and skill development (eg Avativut, ISR CBMP, Inuit Siku Atlas, PISUNA, SIZONet and SmartICE). These tools included interactive maps, databases and archives, online resources for harvesters and interactive multi-media outputs such as audio, video and photographs of observations and educational resources for Northern schools (eg CBMP; Inuit Siku Atlas; ISR PISUNA and SIZONet). Finally, these programmes reported producing community, regional, national and/or international publications, reports and press releases to communicate the results of their programmes at various scales (eg AMAP, CBMP, CEMP and CONAS). Through these different outcomes and outputs, it was evident that these monitoring programmes have the potential to further understandings of the impacts of climate change throughout the Circumpolar North.
