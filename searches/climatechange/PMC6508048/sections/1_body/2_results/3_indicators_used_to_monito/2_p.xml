<p class="p">According to the available data, the different monitoring programmes selected indicators in a variety of ways. Methods for indicator development included: consultation involving international and regional workshops (eg ABEKS, CBMP, PISUNA); the development of a peer-reviewed indicator strategy (eg CBMP); co-developed surveys and questionnaires (eg CONAS); discussions with natural resource councils (eg PISUNA); semi-structured interviews and interactive community events with community members (eg eNuk); examining regional priorities (eg CBMP, ISR CBMP); decision-making by programme staff (eg Globe Observer, ISeeChange); and indicators suggested by those collecting data (eg eNuk, ISeeChange, LEO Network, PISUNA). Although these various methods provided insight into the processes some programmes used to select indicators, the majority of programmes (n = 13) did not explicitly state how indicators were selected, based on the identified grey and peer-reviewed literature.</p>
