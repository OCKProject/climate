<p class="p">This research found that internet and cellular phone connectivity was often limited or non-existent in the North, which has the potential to negatively impact the timeliness of these mobile-phone applications. These app-based monitoring programmes were exploring new and innovative ways to address these concerns. An example of a programme attempting to bridge this digital divide is the SmartICE programme. SmartICE used stationary sensors (SmartBUOYs) to provide timely information about sea ice to community members via satellites, as well as through a mobile, sled-based technology pulled by snowmobiles (SmartQAMUTIK) to measure sea ice thickness [
