<p class="p">The results of this environmental scan indicated that, in large part, advanced web-based technology, such as mobile-phone applications, or tablets, were not used in the data collection process of most monitoring programmes in the Circumpolar North (n = 3/18). For example, data collectors for the Community-Based Wildlife Monitoring Network used hand-held computers to record their observations when out on the land; once they returned home trained data clerks transferred information from the hand-held devices to a regional database [
