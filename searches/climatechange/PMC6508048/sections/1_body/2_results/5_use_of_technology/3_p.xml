<p class="p">This research identified only three programmes in the Circumpolar North that were developing apps for community-based monitoring in the region at the time of this study. The first programme, SmartICE, was designed to observe and disseminate knowledge on sea-ice (ie thickness and surface characteristics), and was developing a mobile-phone application to provide the most up-to-date sea-ice information to community members and to allow for the recording of observations by people travelling on the sea-ice [

The second programme, SIKU, focused on monitoring ice conditions and wildlife and was developing an app and associated web-based tools with the goal of helping to facilitate knowledge transfer, sea-ice safety, participatory mapping, language preservation, education, training and environmental stewardship [

The third, and final programme, eNuk, was developing the eNuk app to allow community members to record and respond to both environment and/or health indicators of climate change via online posts, photos or video uploads. As mentioned, internationally, this research identified three additional monitoring programmes that used app-based technologies to track environmental change: Globe Observer, ISeeChange and LEO Network. These programmes allowed individuals to document different changes they saw in their everyday lives through an app platform, and consolidate these observations and inputs into aggregate information centres. There are therefore many opportunities to incorporate new technologies and innovations into environment-health monitoring systems in the Circumpolar North.
