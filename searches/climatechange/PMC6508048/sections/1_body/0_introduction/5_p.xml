<p class="p">Considering this new and growing area of work, we conducted a review of environment-health monitoring programmes using information and communication technologies (eg tech-based platforms, software, mobile applications, etc.) in the Circumpolar North. An environmental scanning approach was used to provide a “snapshot” of the existing environment-health monitoring programmes during the review time period (September-December 2017) and identify areas of strength and areas of improvement [
 <xref rid="CIT0067" class="xref">73</xref>]. This review aimed to discover, analyse and categorise programmes that: monitored climate change through observing and recording environmental change and/or human health indicators; took place in and around Indigenous communities; and had some level of community involvement. Additionally, this review examined the way monitoring programmes were using technology in the data collection and data sharing processes of their initiatives. This article details findings from this environmental scan review, and discusses: (1) gaps in integrated community-led climate change and health monitoring programmes; and (2) how innovative technology may enable real-time monitoring and the dissemination of information in communities. This synthesis is intended to support the development of further environment-health monitoring programmes in the Circumpolar North, which can inform and enhance decision-making, health programming and health adaptation to climate change and other environmental stressors.
