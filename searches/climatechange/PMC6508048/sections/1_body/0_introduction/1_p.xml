<p class="p">In Northern Canada, the environment is undergoing various changes, stemming from climate change as well as resource extraction and development, which impacts often-intense socio-cultural stressors and transitions in the region (eg lack of adequate housing, food security challenges, mental health concerns, shifting cultural practices, increasing reliance on a wage economy, etc.). These changing environmental conditions present many challenges to health, with the most acute impacts identified among Inuit populations reliant on the land for sustenance and livelihoods [

Indeed, Inuit across Inuit Nunangat in Canada, and throughout the Circumpolar North, are indicating that observed changes in weather, climate and environment directly impact numerous facets of health and wellbeing, interacting with social determinants of health in a number of ways [

  <p class="p">In this article, we define integrated monitoring as programmes or strategies designed to consider the range of potential interactions between environmental changes and human health within dynamic cultural, social, economic and political contexts. For example, this includes programmes aimed at observing and responding to the physical and mental health implications of changing sea ice on Inuit populations (ie increased incidence of hypothermia, or increased rates of anxiety), among others.</p>
