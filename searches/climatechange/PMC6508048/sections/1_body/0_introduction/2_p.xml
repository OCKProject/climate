<p class="p">In the global environment-health literature, the implementation of health monitoring and response is one of the most commonly identified health-related climate change adaptation strategies [

Important health outcomes to monitor associated with a changing environment include physical outcomes, such as: rates of foodborne, waterborne and vectorborne diseases; incidence of injury or mortality due to hazardous travel conditions; and changes to nutritional intake as a result of increased reliance on retail food. There are also mental health outcomes, such as: wide-ranging emotional responses, increased rates of anxiety, depression, loss of identify and sense of place and interpersonal conflict [

 <xref rid="CIT0010" class="xref">10</xref>]. As such, there is a repeated call for the creation of integrated environment-health monitoring that uses novel approaches, integrates new types of data and includes multiple knowledge systems (eg Western Knowledge, Indigenous Knowledge, etc.) [
