<p class="p">A challenge involved in categorising and analysing the indicators monitored by environment-health monitoring programmes, which is perhaps indicative of a greater challenge in monitoring, was that the indicators of environment and human health were often different for each programme. For example, some programmes stated that they monitored the broad category of “sea ice,” while others monitored more specific elements of sea ice including “thickness, colour, time of break-up, incidents of animal entrapment in sea ice, etc”. Although this information was useful as it revealed the types of indicators being monitored, it made comparability across programmes difficult.</p>
