<p class="p">In many Indigenous communities across the North, environment-health monitoring programmes that engage community members have been identified as being more successful than other programmes [
 <xref rid="CIT0089" class="xref">95</xref>]. Specifically, these programmes are recognised in the literature for their ability to combine cultural knowledge surrounding environmental changes with environmental observations, leading to important community adaptation and emergency response strategies [
 <xref rid="CIT0090" class="xref">96</xref>]. This research found that although Indigenous communities were increasingly involved in the monitoring of environment and health through community-based and community-led monitoring, the extent of community involvement varied and was often limited. Although research has identified the benefits of CBM for Indigenous communities, the data analysed in this environmental scan were not sufficient to determine the success of community-led versus community-based monitoring programmes. More research is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of increased community involvement in monitoring initiatives.
