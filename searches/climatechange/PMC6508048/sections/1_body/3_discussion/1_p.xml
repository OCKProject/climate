<p class="p">As evidenced by this research and outlined in the literature [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" class="xref">35</xref>], Indigenous communities across the North are increasingly involved in the design, development and implementation of monitoring programmes in order to observe, record, and respond to climate change. As this synthesis indicates, several important opportunities exist with regard to Indigenous communities monitoring the health effects of climate change, including the need for programmes to: (1) be community-led and community-based; (2) holistically incorporate health and environment; and (3) make use of innovative technologies that are locally appropriate and usable.
