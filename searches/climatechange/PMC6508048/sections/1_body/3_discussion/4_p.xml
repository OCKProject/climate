<p class="p">Existing literature on monitoring health impacts of climate change has highlighted challenges associated with collecting these health indicators, including: (1) identifying relevant health indicators is often dependent on a population’s vulnerability and adaptive capacity, as well as many other determinants; (2) accessing and analysing health data from multiple sources is difficult; (3) determining relationships between complex and often distal climate related risk factors and their health consequences is methodologically challenging; and, (4) identifying, collecting and analysing health data for health practitioners, as well as local and regional governments requires resources and capacity [
