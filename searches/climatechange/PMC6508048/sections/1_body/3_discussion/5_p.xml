<p class="p">The way technology was used by the majority of identified monitoring programmes (ie data visualisation, storage and sharing) has potential to help organise and share information in a way that is accessible beyond research institutions. This research indicated, however, that important challenges remain for programmes with regard to using advanced technology in the data collection phases of monitoring programmes. Similar to existing research [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" class="xref">35</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0089" class="xref">95</xref>], the data revealed that programmes often used low-tech approaches to data collection as a result of poor bandwidth in higher latitudes and minimal computer access, leading to potentially problematic delays in reporting and data errors. As highlighted above, internet and cellular network connectivity issues in the North can often delay time-sensitive information recorded in mobile applications from being uploaded in real-time. Innovative solutions, such as the mobile phone application being developed by the eNuk programme, as well as the stationary and mobile sensors (SmartBOUYs and SmartQAMUTIK), and the satellite technology used by SmartICE [
 <xref rid="CIT0088" class="xref">94</xref>] are beginning to address these challenges and bridge the technological gap that exists in many communities in the North.
