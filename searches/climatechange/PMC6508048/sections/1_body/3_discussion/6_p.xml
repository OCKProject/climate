<p class="p">This review revealed several limitations to existing community-based monitoring programmes in the Circumpolar North. Although the reviewed programmes all had some level of community involvement, only a few programmes were actually 
 <italic class="italic">led</italic> by community members. Further, through examining the indicators monitored by these programmes, it was evident that there is a gap in monitoring the health implications of climate change for communities in this region. Finally, this research revealed that low-tech tools were often used to gather data and monitor indicators, and the need for innovative solutions to gathering this data and improving internet connectivity issues in the North.
