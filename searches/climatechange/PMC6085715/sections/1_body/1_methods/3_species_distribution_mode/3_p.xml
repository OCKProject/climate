 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] blend properties of generalized linear models with additive models. The purpose of generalized additive models is to maximize the quality of prediction of a dependent variable from various distributions, by estimating unspecific (non-parametric) functions of the predictor variables, which are “connected” to the dependent variable
