<p id="Par39" class="p">We ran for each model a 5-fold cross-validation by randomly splitting our occurrence data into 70% used for the model calibration and 30% used to evaluate the current predictive performance of the models. This 5-fold cross-validation yielded an average model for each species and algorithm. Calibrated models, for current conditions, were then used to generate projections of future potential distributions for 2020, 2050 and 2080 under the two climate change scenarios, A2a and B2a. For species with no model presenting a TSS score higher than 0.8, no consensus projection was created and the species were removed from further analyses. All analyses were carried out using the
