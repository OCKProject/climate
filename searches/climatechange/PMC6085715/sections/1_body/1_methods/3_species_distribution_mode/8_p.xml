<p id="Par36" class="p">We combined predictions into an “ensemble” by averaging the models with a true skill statistic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>] higher than 0.8 to obtain a “consensus model” and to avoid the integration of weak models. The main aim of consensus methods is to decrease the predictive uncertainty of single-models, since predictions of species distributions can vary widely among modeling approaches. Indeed, ensemble forecasting can enable a more robust model and overcome the uncertainties derived from each individual model [
