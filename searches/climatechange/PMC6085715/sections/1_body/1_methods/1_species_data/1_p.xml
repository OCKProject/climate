<p id="Par23" class="p">Species records were obtained from scientific surveys published in research literature between 2006 and 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. We performed a literature search in the SCOPUS database using search topic = 
 <italic class="italic">Phlebotomus</italic> OR Sand flies OR Phlebotominae AND Geographical coordinate. Literature indicating only the name of the city or village where the species was recorded were discarded and only species’ occurrences with explicit geographical coordinates were retained. Since the values of environmental predictors at these locations were extracted to fit the model prediction of the species presence across the study area, integrating accurate geographical occurrence points is crucial for better model fitting.
