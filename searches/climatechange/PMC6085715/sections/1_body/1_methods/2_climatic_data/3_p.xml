A2a describes a highly heterogeneous future world with regionally oriented economies. The main driving forces are a high rate of population growth, increased energy use, land-use changes and slow technological change. The B2a scenario is also regionally oriented but with a general evolution towards environmental protection and social equity. Compared to A2a, B2a has a lower rate of population growth and a smaller increase in gross domestic product, but more diverse technological changes and slower land-use changes [
