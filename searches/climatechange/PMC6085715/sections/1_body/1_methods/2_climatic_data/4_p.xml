<p id="Par28" class="p">The original 19 predictor variables were reduced to only 5 climate variables by analysis of collinearity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. A correlation matrix between the 19 climate variables was performed using ArcGis 10.1 and a pair of variables with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.9 were considered as highly correlated. For highly correlated variables, when possible, we preferred extreme variables (min, max) to mean variables since the biological behavior of the vector is highly affected by extreme climatic conditions. The final dataset included: maximum temperature of warmest month, minimum temperature of coldest month, precipitation of wettest quarter, precipitation of driest quarter and elevation.
