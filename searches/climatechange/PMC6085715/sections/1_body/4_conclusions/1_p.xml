<p id="Par56" class="p">Climate change is projected to play an essential role in the expansion of the geographical distribution of specific species of leishmaniasis vectors. Sand fly species are prospected to invade extra-Mediterranean regions, especially in Europe. The monitoring of regions presenting suitable conditions for the vectors’ presence is highly recommended to prevent the outbreak of the disease in densely populated areas with a naïve population. Our study confirmed the importance of environmental and climate factors on the distribution of leishmaniasis vectors and demonstrated the performance of ecological niche modeling in the prediction of the geographical spread of vector diseases. Ecological niche modeling should be considered in the future as a valuable tool in addition to experimental laboratory studies for a better understanding of the biology of vector species.</p>
