<p id="Par55" class="p">Our study focused only on the fundamental ecological niche, which represents the abiotic conditions for the species survival. However, the species is in fact present in a restricted part of the fundamental niche due to biotic interactions. Actually, Hutchinson [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>] defined the realized niche as the portion of the fundamental niche from which a species is not excluded due to biotic competition. Furthermore, the dispersal ability of the species is limited by the maximum flight distance of phlebotomine sand flies, estimated as 1000 m [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>], and geographical barriers. Indeed, even if the wind plays a major role in the species dissemination, the presence of mountain chains and water bodies can limit their geographical dispersal to new suitable areas for the speciesâ€™ survival and reproduction [
