 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>] phlebotomine sand flies are prospected to invade extra-Mediterranean regions especially western and central Europe. Concurrently, 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> vectors will lose areas for suitable conditions in North Africa and Middle East. These changes in their geographical distribution are more intense under the A2a scenario than the B2a. Similar projections for the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P. papatasi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. ariasi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. sergenti</italic> were reported by Trajer et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Nevertheless, these authors focused their study only on the distribution of phlebotomine species in Europe, since no presence records in North Africa and Middle East were included.
