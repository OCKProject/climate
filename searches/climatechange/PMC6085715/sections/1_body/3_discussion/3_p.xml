<p id="Par54" class="p">In a non-endemic location, where the species is suspected to occur, special attention should be taken. Field surveys to detect the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> vectors and monitoring cases of disease in these regions, is crucial to prevent the emergence of new disease foci. Additionally, domestic pets (especially dogs) travelling between endemic areas and non-endemic regions suspected to be suitable for the vector disease should be controlled to avoid the risk of transmission. Indeed, in non-endemic regions where the vector is suspected to be present, the introduction of infected dogs will contribute to the establishment of the disease cycle.
