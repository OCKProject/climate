<p id="Par15" class="p">The Mediterranean basin is considered one of the most vulnerable regions of the world to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Indeed, the Mediterranean region has shown large climate variation in the past [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] and has been identified as one of the most sensitive areas according to future climate change projections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>] temperature will increase in the Mediterranean area while annual precipitation will decrease during the 21st century. Indeed, annual rainfall will decrease in Mediterranean Africa and the northern Sahara, with a greater decrease as the Mediterranean coast is approached. Precipitation will increase in most of northern Europe and decrease in most southern countries bordering the Mediterranean Sea. The same projection for the 21st century states that the annual mean warming will vary from 2.2 to 5.1 Â°C in southern Europe and the Mediterranean area, leading to warmer summers and more temperate winters.
