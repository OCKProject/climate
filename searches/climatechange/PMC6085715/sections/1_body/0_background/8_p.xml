<p id="Par21" class="p">Recently, species distribution modeling has acquired importance, not only for the ability to predict species’ geographical distribution from explanatory variables, but also for the faculty to forecast species’ occurrence under new areas and climatic conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. One alternative to address inter-model variations is to combine several models. The use of an ensemble approach can result in significant improvements on the robustness of predicting species distribution and forecasting their geographical shift under climate change projections [
