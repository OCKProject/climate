 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The prospected change in ambient temperature would increase the vector biting rate and number of human exposures, and reduce the incubation time of the infective agent within its vector [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Furthermore, a higher temperature will reduce the vector winter mortality and new areas will become environmentally suitable for its survival and reproduction. There is evidence that the geographical range of phlebotomine sand flies incriminated in leishmaniasis transmission has changed in response to climate change in the Mediterranean region and Europe.
