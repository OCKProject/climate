<p id="Par46" class="p">The model projection into the two future climate change scenarios showed that the suitable area for 
 <italic class="italic">P. alexandri</italic> distribution will be lost in the north-east of the study area which will cause a centroid shift estimated at 314 and 304 km toward the south-west under A2a and B2a, respectively, in 2020. A higher shift in the same direction is predicted for 2050 and 2080 under both scenarios. For all time-periods and under the two climate change scenarios, the percent of lost area predicted in central and western Asia (especially in Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Iran) was higher than the percent of gained area (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), which was predicted to occur essentially in north African countries, the Middle East, southern Spain and France.
