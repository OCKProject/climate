<p id="Par48" class="p">Under both climate change scenarios and the three time-periods, the species is suspected to progressively lose areas of suitable conditions in western Europe, especially in Spain and France, while new area will be gained by the species eastward including central Europe and western Asia. The area gained by the species is far higher than that predicted to be lost (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Although the two climate change scenarios showed a similar trend, a greater change in the distribution of the lost and gained area by the species is predicted under the A2a scenario, especially during the time-period 2020–2050 (gained area 69.39% under A2a, 37.46% under B2a) and 2050–2080 (lost area -37.60% under A2a, -28.70% under B2a). The change in the suitable area for 
 <italic class="italic">P. ariasi</italic> distribution is reflected in the shift of its centroid projected to move eastward with a maximum shift in 2080 estimated to reach 1279 and 1150 km under the A2a and B2a climate change scenarios, respectively (Table
