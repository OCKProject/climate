<p id="Par40" class="p">Referring to the mean TSS score (0.84 Â± 0.023), model performance was generally high for the included species with a specificity (true negative rate) ranging from 81.03 to 96.52% (mean = 86.94%) and a sensitivity (true positive rate) ranging from 87.93 to 100% (mean = 96.98%). Precipitation of the wettest quarter (Bio16) and precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio17) were the most contributing variables to the models for 
 <italic class="italic">P. papatasi</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P. ariasi</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. alexandri</italic> with 44.72, 43.96 and 64.46%, respectively, of explained variation (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). On the other hand, the minimum temperature of the coldest month (Bio6) and the maximum temperature of the warmest month (Bio5) had the highest contribution to the 
 <italic class="italic">P. sergenti</italic> model with 45.86% of explained variation. The contribution of the altitude ranged from 10.59% for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. ariasi</italic> model to 36.26% for the 
 <italic class="italic">P. alexandri</italic> model, with a mean contribution among all modeled species of 23.64%.
