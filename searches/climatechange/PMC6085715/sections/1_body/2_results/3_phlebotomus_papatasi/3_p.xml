<p id="Par44" class="p">Under the two climate change scenarios (A2a and B2a) and the three time periods (2020, 2050 and 2080) the suitable area for 
 <italic class="italic">P. papatasi</italic> presence was predicted to be gained progressively in northern and western Europe. Concurrently, the potential area for species presence would be lost in the south of north African countries and the Middle East (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Nevertheless, the total gained area is higher than the total lost area for all scenarios and time periods (Table
