  <title class="title">Centroid displacement of landcover mediated by future climate change.</title>
  <p class="p">In the map of South America we show the location of the centroids for native landcover categories (A—mosaic; B—sparse vegetation, C—closed vegetation, D—open vegetation, E—closed deciduous forest). Insets relate to each native landcover; the points represent the centroids of their respective current distributions, while the arrowheads represent the respective centroids under the 2080 climatic scenarios, showing the direction of change with arrow length representing the intensity of change. The gray arrows refer to RCP 4.5 and black arrows to RCP 8.5.</p>
