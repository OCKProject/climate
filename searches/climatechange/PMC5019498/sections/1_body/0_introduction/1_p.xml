 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and changes are expected to increase in the near future, exacerbating threats to biodiversity. However, most of our current attention is directed toward losses of native landcover due to agricultural or urban expansion, overlooking other causes of reduction. Human-induced climate change can be a new driver of losses in native landcover because native vegetation distributions are related to climatic variables and, consequently, they may be affected by future climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. So, while native vegetation conversion might be the main anthropogenic change currently threatening biodiversity, climate change could be equally or even more influential in the near future [
