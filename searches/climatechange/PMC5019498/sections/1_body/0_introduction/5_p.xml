<p class="p">The use of native landcover as a focus of analysis brings some methodological advantages, which increase analytical robustness. Unlike species distributions, landcover distributions are well known, which improves at least two methodological steps of geographical distribution modeling. One of the main problems of studies using geographical distribution modeling is the sampling bias associated with species occurrences (the basic information used to estimate a speciesâ€™ fundamental niche), which lead to biased predictions of distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. As an alternative approach, the known landcover distribution enables part of the data to be used to generate the prediction (calibration) and the remaining data can be used to validate the distribution essentially bias-free. These methodological advantages confer benefits in terms of applicability to conservation because planning for the future must be based on the most reliable results, which infers predictions with reduced uncertainty and distribution errors. Therefore, investigation of native landcover changes in future climate scenarios has crucial applicability for public policy on biodiversity conservation because of the methodological robustness with which predictions can be generated.
