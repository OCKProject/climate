<p class="p">Landcover alteration mediated by future climate change could become a direct threat to biodiversity due to its potential to change habitat availability for species, reducing or displacing them [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>].There are also indirect consequences because landcover categories correspond to different habitat structures and, when unfavorable, these latter can act as barriers to species movement [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In this way, landcover changes through space and time can define boundaries of present and future ecological regions suitable for species [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Recognition of these boundaries can promote new perspectives on management of anthropogenic climate change impacts [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], since we can identify future refuges in which species can persist. Consequently, understanding the loss or displacement of landcover types is a high priority for research and for supporting conservation actions [
