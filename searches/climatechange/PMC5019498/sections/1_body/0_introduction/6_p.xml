<p class="p">Therefore, we study the effects of future climate scenarios on native landcover distribution in South America using the geographical distribution modeling approach and infer the conservation implications of our findings. The study area includes at least seven major terrestrial biomes depending on the classification adopted (tropical forest, deciduous forest, shrubland, grassland, savanna, desert, and mountain), which are distributed in 13 countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay, and Venezuela). Even though ecological patterns do not respect sociopolitical boundaries, many conservation strategies are undertaken at this scale, highlighting the importance of analyzing and discussing the effects of climate change at the country level. We also endeavor to identify the climatic refuges of native landcover that could be essential for protecting biodiversity into the future and discuss the relative importance of them in each of the South American countries. To do this, we asked the following questions: what are the native landcover categories that will potentially contract or expand their distributions as a consequence of climate change, resulting in habitat loss or habitat expansion?; what is the direction and intensity of these potential changes (latitudinal/longitudinal), leading to potential raising of barriers to species dispersal?; and which regions and countries are the most stable, indicating that they should be prioritized for conservation?</p>
