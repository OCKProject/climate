<p class="p">The conceptual and methodological framework to study effects of climate change on biodiversity has been advancing in recent years, driven by the importance and complexity of the topic [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. These approaches involve a diversity of subjects, which include forest dynamics and threatened and specialist species. One of the main approaches employed to study climate change impacts has typically consisted of a technique known as species distribution modeling. It is also known as ecological niche modeling because it aims to predict the potential distribution of species through their fundamental niches [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. As a result, species distribution patterns, mediated by climate change, are one of the most studied themes in climate change science [
