<p class="p">However, the species distribution models can be used to target predictions beyond species ecological niches because, in a simplified view, these methods consist of correlatives approaches between occurrence and environmental data (frequently climatic variables). In this way, species distribution models identify a multi-dimensional environmental space, which is projected in a two or three-dimensional map, showing the expected geographic distribution based on the environmental conditions [

Therefore, the possibilities of using species distribution models concern the investigation of environmental mediated patterns beyond the ecological attributes of species, which permitted the use of these techniques even in other research areas (in social science [
