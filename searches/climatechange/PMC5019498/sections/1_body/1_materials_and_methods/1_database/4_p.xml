<p class="p">We investigated nineteen climatic variables to evaluate potential landcover distributions (

We chose three different Global Climate Models (GCMs: Community Climate System Model—CCSM, Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate–MIROC, and Institut Pierre Simon Laplace—IPSL) to decrease uncertainty based on inconsistencies between climate models [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. These GCMs were selected because they have widely available digital databases, predict climate change differently (which helps reveal to what extent results depend on the CGM chosen), and exhibit a reasonable adjustment over the study region. All three were derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project–Phase 5 (CMPI5) [
