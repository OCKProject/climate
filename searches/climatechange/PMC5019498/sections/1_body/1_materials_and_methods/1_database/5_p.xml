<p class="p">We adopted the pre-industrial climatic scenario as being responsible for current native landcover distributions. Changes to native landcover distributions since the industrial revolution are mainly due to urban and agricultural expansion and not to climate change because there is a time lag in the response of landcover to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Therefore, we assert that current native landcover is better characterized by the pre-industrial climatic scenario, justifying our choice. Climate data up to the year 2080 was generated according to the emission scenarios of the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5.
