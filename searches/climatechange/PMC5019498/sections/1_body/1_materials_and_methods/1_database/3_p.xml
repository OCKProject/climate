<p class="p">The landcover map was overlaid with grid cells of 0.5Â° latitude and longitude. Then, the landcover map was upscaled according to the most abundant native landcover category in each grid cell. There is an error associated with this extrapolation because the current most abundant native landcover does not always represent the original vegetation, mainly in grid cells located in agricultural lands. However, this error did not affect our results, as is described below in the results section.</p>
