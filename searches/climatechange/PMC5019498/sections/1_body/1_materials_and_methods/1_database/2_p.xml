<p class="p">In our study, anthropogenic landcover categories (urban areas, agricultural lands, etc.) were not included in any of the analyses because their distribution, current and into the future, are strongly influenced by political incentives for urban/agricultural development, roads, etc. As a result, anthropogenic landcover categories must be analyzed using variables that are beyond the scope of the climatic variables used in this paper. For this reason, we removed all categories under anthropogenic influence (urban areas, agricultural lands, etc.) from the landcover map before modeling.</p>
