<p class="p">The quality of any spatial modeling approach can be affected by spatial autocorrelation present in both the environmental database, due to gradients of climate variation, and in the biological database, due to a direct response to climate gradients and biases in species sampling [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. To avoid this problem, we modeled the distribution through pre-industrial climatic scenarios using 25% randomly-selected grid cells; the random selection theoretically permitted a sampling free of bias, covering the environmental variability of the study area and improving the model-adjusted predictions [

 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> were generated through 10 replicates of each method, whereby the selected grid cells (the 25% cited above) were divided into 75% of the data for calibration and 25% for validation [
