<p class="p">Our modeling approach started by estimating the best method of prediction under current climatic conditions. We assumed the best method as that for which the predicted distribution (generated through the pre-industrial climatic scenarios) most closely matched the original distribution (i.e. the result of the decision tree classification) (
