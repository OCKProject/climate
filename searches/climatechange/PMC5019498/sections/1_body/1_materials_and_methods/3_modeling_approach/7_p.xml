<p class="p">Finally, a second ensemble forecasting regarding the prediction of the three different GCMs was undertaken to represent the final distribution of each landcover category. We did an ensemble forecasting among GCMs to find the locations where all predictions converged to reduce prediction uncertainties. Then we compared the future landcover distribution with the current distribution to find places where it remained unchanged; these areas can be considered as locations of climatic and landcover stability, which are potential refuges for biodiversity. To do this, the current and future landcover distributions were compared through two descriptors of range, i.e. the area and the location of the latitudinal/longitudinal centroid, to evaluate the changes mediated by climate. We then calculated the potential area of refuges in each South American country. All measures of geographical distributions were calculated using ArcMapÂ® software version 10.</p>
