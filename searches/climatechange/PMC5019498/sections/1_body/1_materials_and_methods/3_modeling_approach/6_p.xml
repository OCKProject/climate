<p class="p">After modeling, the 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> classified under the same landcover category were aggregated to express the totality of their spatial distribution. Our objective was to infer the effects of climate change on native landcover categories and the comparison would not be possible using the 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> because they are not comparable among climatic models.
