<p class="p">These geographical distribution techniques are commonly used to estimate the potential distributions of species through a combination of environmental variables and species occurrence [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Here, we fueled the system with 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> occurrence (groups generated by the decision tree) instead of species occurrence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), so the cells of grid have information on the presence or absence of the different classes represented by leaves. We opted to use 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> in place of landcover categories because the latter show a larger climatic space due to extensive geographic range distribution. The use of 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> could avoid over-extrapolation of the spatial extent of landcover because it would minimize the climate range. The climatic variables used were those indicated by the decision tree analysis as being efficient for differentiating and predicting landcover categories. In all likelihood, we increased the robustness of our prediction with this approach by avoiding model overparameterization. The distribution models were analyzed in R software, using the 
 <italic class="italic">BIOMOD</italic> package [
