<p class="p">The classical way to group data according to ecological similarity is by using cluster analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Cluster analysis is not a specific algorithm, but a conceptual method that generates groups based on the similarity of sampling units. The most common clustering algorithms are k-means and Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA), which are examples of non-hierarchical and hierarchical methods, respectively [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. However, these methods can create arbitrary groups because they depend on 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> definitions of group numbers in the case of k-means or the cut-off point of a dendrogram for UPGMA [
