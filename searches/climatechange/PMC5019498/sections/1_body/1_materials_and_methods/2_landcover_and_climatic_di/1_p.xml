<p class="p">Since our approach includes only climatic variation, not considering the full range of variables influencing the distribution of landcovers, it is expected that some landcover classes show the same environmental/climatic space. This means that two or more landcover classes can be described by the same climatic conditions because other variables, such as topography and soils, can be limiting of their distribution. Therefore, we first evaluated climatic similarities among grid cells, creating groups that represent landcover categories that have a unique climatic identity (
