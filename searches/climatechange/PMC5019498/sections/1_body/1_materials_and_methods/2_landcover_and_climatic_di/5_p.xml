<p class="p">The result of the decision tree process is a highly subdivided data set, which can partition grid cells with the same landcover type into more than one 
 <italic class="italic">leaf</italic>. Each 
 <italic class="italic">leaf</italic> has a prediction that best characterizes its landcover category, i.e. it may or may not be the original category of the grid cell. This prediction reveals which landcover categories have a distribution corresponding to the climate and for which categories the climatic space overlap, resulting in a shared classification. This is the basic evaluation about the ability of landcover distribution to be predicted by climate that is essential for our approach.
