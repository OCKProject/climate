We performed the decision trees after removing grid cells with more than 50% of area occupied by anthropogenic landcover and compared the proportion of grid cells correctly classified with the result using all grid cells. We also related the probability of a grid cell to be correctly classified with the proportion of anthropogenic landcover in the cell.</p>
