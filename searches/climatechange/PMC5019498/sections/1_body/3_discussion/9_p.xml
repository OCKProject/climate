<p class="p">Another possible source of uncertainty, for which we had less control, was the initial database of our modeling. A comparison of different digital databases has shown that Globcover data overestimate the closed forest class [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. This class occupied the largest part of the original landcover map and the largest predicted area after modeling. We cannot be sure if the initial size of categories could have influenced the estimation of refuges. Unfortunately, despite the uncertainties involved in models and databases, actions for effective conservation cannot await a decreased knowledge gap because the disruption of weather patterns now threatens many species and ecological process [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. Therefore, decisions need to be taken based on the best available information, and, in this sense, areas of refuges predicted here, at least for closed forests, are similar to those predicted in previous work [
