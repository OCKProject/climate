<p class="p">Displacement of vegetation types threatens all categories, but is more intense for sparse vegetation, which is also the most affected by range contraction. Predictions for mosaic landcover also estimate a large contraction and displacement in range distribution, considering its total area. Mosaic and sparse vegetation presently are found at the Atacama Desert and other areas of the Andes. Climate change is expected to intensely affect these landcover categories because it will disrupt the extreme weather conditions that regulate the ecological processes and species distributions occurring there. Contraction of the sparse vegetation and mosaics characteristic of the Atacama Desert and Andes could exacerbate the isolation of the specialist species of those habitats, such as the Andean cat (

This process of habitat contraction can engender a habitat island effect, with progressive reductions ultimately leading to extirpation, giving no options to species for dispersal, which could drive species extinction and/or alter evolutionary processes and patterns. Thus, sparse vegetation and mosaics, as well as the species restricted to these landcovers, would seem to be the most affected by climate change and, consequently, they are the categories of most concern regarding climatic threats.
