<p class="p">Regardless of their direction and intensity, the predicted changes to native landcover distributions are a threat to biodiversity because 2080 (the year for which extrapolations were estimated) is in the near future considering the temporal scales of some ecological and the majority of evolutionary processes. The intensity and velocity of these changes will probably nullify the evolutionary adaptive time of species and their ability to disperse to adequate areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], it is probable that the effect of climatic change on species will be more intense than what we have described here for landcover categories, because they include just very broad categories and we know that there are more variations in vegetation types, mainly at local scales.
