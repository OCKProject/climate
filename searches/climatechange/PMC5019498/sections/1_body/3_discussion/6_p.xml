<p class="p">Recognizing areas of distributional stability among the different climate models is essential because they are potential refuges for biodiversity. Closed vegetation seems to be the least vulnerable because it is predicted to retain the largest proportion of potential forested refuges [

 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. However, our results indicate that the spatial distribution of these refuges is concentrated in the Southwest of the Brazilian Amazon and the upper Pacific coast of South America, which includes many distinct vegetation types and biogeographic provinces, found on both sides of the Andean chain. Therefore, with appropriate protection, these forested landcovers will likely maintain climate refuges for biodiversity, while the biodiversity distributed in other areas presently covered by closed forests are threatened, such as the species and ecological processes in the closed vegetation of the Atlantic coast.
