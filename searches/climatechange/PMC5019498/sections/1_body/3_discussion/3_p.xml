<p class="p">There has been a lack of predictions under future climate scenarios for the Brazilian Caatinga biome, located in the Northeast region of South America. This biome is typically composed of open and dry vegetation, sometimes considered as desert [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. The projection scenarios predict a contraction of open vegetation in that region, bringing uncertainty about the future of open areas in the northeast of the continent. However, here, we have predicted a partial expansion of closed vegetation into Caatinga, which could explain previous evidence of mammal range expansion into the areas presently occupied by the Caatinga, suggesting that mammals could be favored by climate change with concomitant expansion of their present distributions [
 <xref rid="pone.0162500.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Therefore, our models seem to indicate that a relaxation of dry environmental conditions in areas of Caatinga could occur, resulting in a landcover that would exhibit an intermediate structure between closed and open vegetation.
