<p class="p">The lack of refuges predicted for some landcover categories or regions does not necessarily mean their complete absence. Divergences among climate models may result in failure to identify refuges, particularly for landcover categories with limited distributions. Thus, research at a smaller scale (local, regional or targeted to particular species with restricted ranges) probably will be more sensitive to methodological approaches using climatic variables. Improved climate modeling also would permit better predictions of landcover, ecosystems and species distributions [

However, improvements to regional model predictions may require better climate data and more careful planning of the distribution of registering stations. For vegetation, a better understanding of climate variability, which at present is little understood, will likely be crucial, because seasonality is critical to define some characteristics of the vegetation types, such as deciduousness [
