<p class="p">While the threats to closed vegetation differ among South America regions, the other landcover categories present a critical conservation situation from the viewpoint of climatic refuges. Open vegetation is the second largest landcover category among those evaluated here, extending from the Northeast through the Mid-South of South America. However, our identified refuges are only a small proportion of its original distribution and these are located predominantly in Argentina. Other landcover types showed even more critical states due to their small distribution so that refuges are almost nonexistent.</p>
