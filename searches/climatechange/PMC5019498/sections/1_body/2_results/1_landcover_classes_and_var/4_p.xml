<p class="p">The efficiency of our classification was not affected by anthropogenic landcover. The proportion of grid cells correctly classified was approximately the same when we excluded from the decision tree those cells with more than 50% of area occupied by anthropogenic landcover (0.40â€“0.45 of grid cells correctly classified). Therefore, the probability of a grid cell to be correctly classified was not related to the proportion of anthropogenic landcover in the cell.</p>
