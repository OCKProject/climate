<p class="p">The final aggregation of similar climate-linked landcover types resulted in four categories for MIROC and five for CCSM and IPSL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162500.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). However, most of these categories covered a wide range of climatic conditions and can be divided into subgroups (
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic>) according to their climatic properties (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The grid cells comprising a 
 <italic class="italic">leaf</italic> are spatially aggregated, which is expected due to the spatial structure of climatic variation. Thus, the final 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic> of the decisions tree are subdivisions of spatially aggregated landcover categories (
