<p class="p">According to the random forest results, the decision tree efficiently grouped grid cells (73% of variation was explained in all cases). However, approximately 56% of grid cells were classified differently from their original landcover classes. For these grid cells, predicted landcover was frequently consistentâ€”grid cells from the same original landcover ended in the same class (for example, the
