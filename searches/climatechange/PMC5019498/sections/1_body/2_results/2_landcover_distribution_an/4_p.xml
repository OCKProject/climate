<p class="p">The ensemble of different climate scenarios showed that 47.3% of South America can be considered areas of climatic stability under the RCP 4.5 scenario. These areas can be considered refuges for biodiversity facing the potential impacts of climate change. However, only 29.1% of the territory was indicated as refuges under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The main landcover types represented in these refuges under both climatic scenarios were closed vegetation (RCP 4.5 = 39.5%; RCP 8.5 = 25.2%), followed by open vegetation (RCP 4.5 = 4.6%; RCP 8.5 = 1.6%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). The other landcover categories had limited areas of stability under RCP 4.5 (CDF = 0.001%; SV = 0.4%; MO = 0.3%), which could potentially decrease or even disappear under the RCP 8.5 scenario (MO = 0.1%).
