<p class="p">We performed 4,560 models of native landcover distribution against pre-industrial climate scenarios (12 modeling methods*10 replicates*38 
 <italic class="italic">leaves</italic>, divided into three climatic models), which generated 456 estimated distributions. However, many of them were inconsistent with original distributions, showing that geographical distribution modeling can fail to estimate geographical distribution (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). GAM and MARS had similar performance and range distribution predictions. Thus, GAM and MARS strongly influenced the ensemble forecasting of the statistical methods, making the predictions of these three methods largely similar (

To simplify comparisons and conclusions, we selected the statistical method of ensemble forecasting to predict landcover distributions under future climate scenarios; in this, it was quite efficient and, being an ensemble, it should generate the best results in terms of predicting distributions.
