<p class="p">All landcover categories showed changes in area and displacement of distribution centroids; the changes predicted by RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios were usually in the same direction, but the latter were more intense (Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g004" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). Closed vegetation was the only native landcover predicted to expand. This expansion was mostly in the western part of its distribution, which generated a centroidal displacement in this direction. The other native landcover types tended to severely reduce their range distribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Open vegetation was predicted to lose range mainly in the Northeast, but with limited expansion in the South, which displaced the centroid south-westwards by more than 300 km. The closed deciduous forest could be reduced by more than 50% in the more optimistic future climatic scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>), with this range contraction displacing the centroid. Sparse vegetation seemed to be the most affected in terms of range distribution contraction and displacement, shifting almost 2,000 kilometers northwards (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>) or even being totally extirpated under the most pessimistic climate change scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Mosaic presented the lowest centroidal displacement (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162500.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>), but this is not indicative of reduced concern because the proportion of predicted range contraction was intense, which could reduce the mosaic vegetation to three small and isolated vegetated nuclei (
