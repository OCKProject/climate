<p class="p">The objectives of this study were to simulate climate change impacts on future rice production in Africa and explore causes of impacts. We used an adapted version of the ORYZA2000 model (Van Oort, De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) to simulate rice yields for irrigated systems in the wet and in the dry season and for rainfed systems for a typical lowland soil and a typical upland soil. We analysed yield changes for all four climate change scenarios comparing the 2000s with the 2070s. As an adaptation option for farmers we simulated the effects of farmers switching to varieties with a higher temperature sum. Temperature sum refers to the cumulative degree‐days which the crop requires to progress between phenological stages.
