<p class="p">There have to date been no comprehensive climate change impact studies for rice in Africa as have been presented for Asia. (Sultan &amp; Gaetani, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) reviewed climate change impact studies for West Africa. From this overview we can see that most climate change impact studies have been on other crops than rice. Another recent study on nine crops in Africa did not include rice because rice was considered a relatively small crop in Africa and because the model used could not simulate paddy rice (Rippke et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). We found only three recent published country specific studies on climate change on rice in Africa. Gerardeaux, Giner, Ramanantsoanirina, and Dusserre (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and Daccache, Sataya, and Knox (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) both used the CERES‐Rice model and both found small positive effects of climate change on rice in Madagascar and Malawi respectively. Adejuwon (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) predicted for Nigeria using the EPIC crop model that rice yields would increase with temperature changes up to +2/+3°C (

 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and Lobell et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), estimated that rice yields in West and Central Africa would slightly decline and those in East and Southern Africa would slightly increase with climate change. The very limited number of studies, all with different models, does not yield a consistent or comprehensive estimate of climate change impact on rice in Africa. Here, we present a new study covering more countries and using one (improved) model throughout.
