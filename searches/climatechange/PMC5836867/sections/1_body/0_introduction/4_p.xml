<p class="p">Crop growth models can be used as tools to quantify possible impacts of different climate scenarios. They integrate many effects and physiological interactions during the growing season. The manifold of processes included in these models sometimes makes it less clear why certain changes in yield emerge. Apart from using a crop growth model (ORYZA2000) to assess possible climate change impacts we also use the model in a diagnostic mode to explore the main causes of projected yield increases or declines.</p>
