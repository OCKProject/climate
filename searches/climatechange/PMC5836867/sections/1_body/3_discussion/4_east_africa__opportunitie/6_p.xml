 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>) showed that for the current climate hardly any yield gains from converting rainfed lowland into irrigated lowland (+3%). Rainfed uplands would benefit strongly from more irrigation (+71%). These results suggest that with a high groundwater table (40 cm) as we assumed for rainfed lowland soils, rainfall in Madagascar is sufficient to obtain potential production levels. If farmers stay with current varieties, irrigation does not help as an adaptation option to climate change: irrigation alone has the same positive effect now and in the future. The combination of irrigation and adapted varieties (i.e. with unchanged duration) does act as a promising climate change adaptation option with projected yield gains of 6% (rainfed lowland) to 28% (rainfed upland).
