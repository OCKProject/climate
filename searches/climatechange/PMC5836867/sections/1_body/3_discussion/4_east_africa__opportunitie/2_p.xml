<p class="p">According to von Liebig's law of the minimum (De Wit, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>), crop production is constrained by the most limiting resource. Resources include light, atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, soil nutrient supply and water supply. Our simulations suggest that yield increases are possible in most of East Africa, caused by more favourable temperatures and increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations. According to von Liebig's law, these yield increases will only materialize if CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is more limiting than water and nutrient supply. In line with this, our simulations showed larger yield increases in the East African irrigated systems than in the rainfed systems, because there during parts of the growing season water is more limiting than CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This suggests that to benefit from climate change, East African countries will need to improve water management. The same rationale applies to nutrient supply: to sustain projected yield increases, more nutrient uptake will be needed, while soil fertility is low in much of Africa (Haefele, Nelson, &amp; Hijmans, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and fertilizer application levels are also often low. If water and nutrient management are not improved, then yields will increase only little, or not increase.
