<p class="p">The results raise the question whether in the current climate longer duration varieties might also be a good idea (Lobell, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). There are three arguments against doing so in this particular case. Firstly, a longer growing period would probably just lengthen the vegetative phase of rice growth, which is often already quite long in the cooler environment of Madagascar. In such situations, longer duration for a sink limited crop would give little yield gain. Secondly, there may be economic objections against longer duration varieties. If for example a variety with 180 vs. 150 days has a potential yield of 9 vs. 8 t/ha, then the marginal yield gain is 12.5% (=(9−8)/8) and the marginal increase in duration is 20% (=(180−150)/150). Since production costs (irrigation, weeding) are often strongly related to crop duration, a longer duration may not be profitable (Senegalese farmers for this reason reported preferring short duration varieties over available higher yielding medium duration varieties, see Van Oort et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Thirdly, there is the issue of farm planning. Farmers in Madagascar often grow two crops per year, with a nonrice crop in the winter period (Harvey et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Naudin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Labour availability and length of the growing period of the other crop may be a reason for not wanting to grow varieties with a longer duration, because this might create logistic problems. For these reasons, we opted not to explore the scenario of adaption of longer duration varieties in the current climate.
