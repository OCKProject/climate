They proposed a method to compute how much a technology contributes as a climate change adaptation option, by accounting for how much it would already contribute in the current climate. We applied the framework developed by (Guan et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) in Madagascar, because Madagascar is by far the largest rice producer in East Africa and because also for Madagascar our analysis suggested large yield increases (Table

We applied Guan's framework to two “technologies”: (i) conversion of rainfed land to irrigated land and (ii) choice of varieties with a higher temperature sum (“unchanged duration”), thus off‐setting natural shortening of the growing period due to temperature rise. Guan's framework defines four production
