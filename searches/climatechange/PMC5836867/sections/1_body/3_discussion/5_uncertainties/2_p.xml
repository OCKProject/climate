<p class="p">A number of uncertainties were identified in this study. Firstly the leaf photosynthesis temperature response which we discussed above. Secondly the uncertainty about cold sterility (see our discussion in 2.2.2). A physiologically sufficiently sophisticated model would not require applying different parameters for the same variety in different regions such as we did in this study. Further empirical and modelling work is needed in this regard. Thirdly, the uncertainty caused by not accounting for soil fertility in our modelling work. We assumed the response to climate change would be similar under low and high soil fertility conditions. Recent research by Guan et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) showed in another crop that this may indeed be a plausible assumption. If projected climate change impact is negative then there would be no interaction with soil fertility, because less nutrients are demanded from the soil, so soil nutrient content does not matter. On the other hand if climate change impact shows increasing potential yields then more nutrients will be demanded from the soil. This extra nutrient uptake will be more easily met on the more fertile soils or if additional fertilizer is applied. In this scenario climate change impact would be positive only on fertile soils and be neutral on infertile soils, a three way positive interaction between soil fertility, CO

Investigation of soil fertility interactions was impossible because it would require high resolution soil fertility mapping and validation of a rice model for nutrient balances, something which was beyond the scope of this paper. Clearly studying such interactions would be most relevant for East Africa, where our simulations show increasing potential yields. The fourth uncertainty is that of possible change in rainfall patterns. Large uncertainty exists about future changes in precipitation (Giannini et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lobell &amp; Burke, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lobell et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). No scenario data are available with projections of changes in within‐season daily rainfall patterns. This comes on top of our assumptions on groundwater depth, for which also no high (spatial and temporal) resolution African datasets are available. Altogether we deem these uncertainties too large to allow for meaningful analyses of their effects on future rainfed rice yields. Future increased rainfall intensity might also cause increased flood risk (Aich et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), which we could not model because ORYZA2000 has no component simulating damage due to flooding and because of lack of high resolution rice maps along river systems in Africa.
