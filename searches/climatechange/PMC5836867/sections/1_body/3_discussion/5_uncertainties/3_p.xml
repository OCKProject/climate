<p class="p">Relatively much awareness exist of the above four uncertainties in the scientific community. There are two uncertainties of which we are aware but for which we are even more uncertain than those listed above. These are future effects of climate change on salinity and on cyclone frequency. It is known that climate change will lead to sea level rise which will affect mangrove rice systems in coastal zones, which according to Balasubramanian et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) represent 9% of Africa's rice area. The number of unknowns is too large to allow for quantitative estimation of how far sea water intrusion will increase and how this will affect mangrove rice areas. Rice in Africa is only affected by cyclones in Madagascar, one of the largest rice producers of Africa. According to (Harvey et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) cyclones have in the last 5 years affected 51% of all farmers in Madagascar, causing severe yield losses. Cyclone frequency worldwide is in general expected to increase with climate change, but how much frequency will increase in Madagascar is still very uncertain (Mendelsohn, Emanuel, Chonabayashi, &amp; Bakkensen, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Thus there are a number of additional negative climate change effects that can be anticipated but for which the magnitude of changes as well as the possible impacts are still very uncertain.
