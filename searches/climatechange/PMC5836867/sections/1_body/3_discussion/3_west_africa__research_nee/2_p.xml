<p class="p">The way in which effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature are modelled can have large effects on model outcomes in climate change impact assessments (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). (Adam, Van Bussel, Leffelaar, Van Keulen, &amp; Ewert, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) showed that the assumption of a constant radiation use efficiency is not realistic and that temperature effects need to be included. Two model approaches include such temperature effects (i) the simpler Light Response Curve photosynthesis model multiplied with a temperature function (LRC approach) or (ii) the Farquhar‐von Caemmerer‐Berry (FvCB approach) biochemical model of leaf photosynthesis (Farquhar, Von Caemmerer, &amp; Berry, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>). Li et al. (
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) found large variation in simulated biomass as a function of different crop growth models with different leaf photosynthesis submodels, but did not find systematic differences between LRC and FvCB based crop growth models. ORYZA2000 uses the LRC approach, in which the light response curve is multiplied with a trapezoid temperature response function (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The origins of this function are unclear and the function has not been changed or tested since its’ implementation in the 1990s. Notably, this trapezoid temperature response function uses daily air temperature as the explanatory (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>) variable. For the hot semiarid environment of irrigated dry season rice the possibility cannot be ruled out that, in analogy with the heat sterility case, increased transpirational cooling at higher temperatures and high vapour pressure deficit (Julia &amp; Dingkuhn, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Van Oort et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) acts as a natural adaptive mechanism allowing the plant to keep up photosynthesis in extremely hot climates with ample irrigation to sustain the transpiration flow. However, such strong transpirational cooling could also lead to lower intercellular leaf CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations which could in theory lead to a decreasing photosynthesis rate (Leuning, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Ogee, Brunet, Loustau, Berbigier, &amp; Delzon, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Wang &amp; Leuning, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Yin &amp; Van Laar, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Thus much uncertainty still remains. Albeit the existence of different leaf photosynthesis models, very limited experimental research has been conducted on rice photosynthesis in the extremely high (&gt;40°C) temperature range. The single exception we are aware of is the study by (Stuerz, Sow, Muller, Manneh, &amp; Asch, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) who measured in the hot (semi) arid delta of the Senegal river and who did not find any photosynthesis reductions even in the hottest part of the year. Closer analysis of temperatures in the study site of Stuerz et al. shows that there, temperatures were still just below the range where according to the ORYZA2000 model photosynthesis would be severely reduced (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). No rice leaf photosynthesis measurements have ever been reported from hotter environments, such as the inland dry season irrigated rice in countries like Mali, Niger, northern Benin and northern Nigeria. For these countries we are extrapolating with our model into a temperature range where models have hitherto not been tested, which makes our projections more uncertain. The uncertainties reported here probably also apply to other rice crop growth models (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), as the root of the problem is the same: a lack of testing and lack of experimental data from extremely hot environments. Rice models would benefit from testing, comparison and improvement in such environments and testing across multiple environments. Our paper shows the relevance of such research and identifies target areas for such research.
