<p class="p">Interestingly and in contradiction with previous studies (Matthews et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>), the use of a new heat sterility model suggests that heat sterility in the future will hardly increase and not really become a problem. We note this is a preliminary conclusion. Heat sterility validations have been presented for the cooler delta and middle valley region of the Senegal river (Van Oort, De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), which is hot and dry but still cooler than in the inland dry season irrigated rice systems of West Africa, along the Niger river basin and the Benue river basin, where heat sterility models have to date not yet been tested. Parts of the new heat sterility model are still quite uncertain, especially the part predicting peak flowering time (Julia &amp; Dingkuhn, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). This suggests also a need for more empirical and modelling research on heat sterility models.
