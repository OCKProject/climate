<p class="p">Overall, negative impacts of climate change on rice yields in Africa are shown in all scenarios if farmers stay with current varieties. Predominantly positive effects are observed if farmers adopt varieties with a higher temperature sum, keeping pace with shortening of the growing duration due to temperature. With this adaptation option, rice yields in irrigated environments in East Africa could increase (around +25% in the most extreme scenario RCP8.5, from 2000 to 2070) and they will increase less in rainfed rice environments. Irrigated rice yields in the hot dry season of West Africa will reduce significantly due to reduced photosynthesis. For East Africa to benefit from climate change, improved water management and possibly also soil fertility management will be needed in combination with gradually replacing current varieties with varieties with a higher temperature sum. In West Africa, more research is required to improve our knowledge on photosynthesis processes during extreme temperatures and research is needed on adaptation options for rice farmers such as shifting sowing dates more into the cold dry season.</p>
