<p class="p">This study is the first comprehensive study that addresses the impact of climate change on rice productivity in Africa. Overall, yield decline is found in all scenarios if farmers continue using the current varieties. Small yield increases are predicted if farmers adopt varieties that have a higher temperature sum, thus adapting to shortening of the growing duration induced by temperature increases. Two main causes of yield decline were identified:</p>
