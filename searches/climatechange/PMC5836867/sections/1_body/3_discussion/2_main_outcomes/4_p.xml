This has spurred much research on heat induced sterility and so called “critical temperatures”. However, some recent studies still look at maximum air temperatures (Gourdji, Sibley, &amp; Lobell, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), not accounting for transpirational cooling and early flowering. And no study so far has identified reduced assimilation at extreme temperatures as a possible cause of future rice yield reductions. Identifying these underlying mechanisms is relevant for breeders when screening for heat tolerant breeding material and can help formulate more specific follow‐up research questions.
