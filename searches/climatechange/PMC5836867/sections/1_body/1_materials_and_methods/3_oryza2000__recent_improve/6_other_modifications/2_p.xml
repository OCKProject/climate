<p class="p">Two other modifications were made relative to the ORYZA2000v2n13s14 version (Van Oort, De Vries etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and relevant in the context of climate change. Firstly, the original ORYZA2000 model did not allow for simulating separately the effects of increasing daily minimum and maximum temperatures. Climate change studies consistently show that minimum temperatures increase more than maximum temperatures. We built into the model the option to separately increase

 <sub class="sub">min</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. Secondly, we corrected the method of simulating future change in humidity. The ORYZA2000 model reads daily actual vapour pressure from a weather file. If temperatures are increased, saturated vapour pressure increases. Without simultaneously increasing actual vapour pressure, the original ORYZA2000 predicts a decreasing relative humidity (RH). According to most climate change scenarios this will not happen, they predict RH will remain the same as in the current climate (Allen &amp; Ingram,

 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Willett, Jones, Gillett, &amp; Thorne, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We found that simulations with decreasing relative humidity (as in the original model) led to large overestimation of future drought. To correct for this effect we incorporated a function that maintains the same level of RH between current climate conditions and climate change scenarios by adjusting the actual vapour pressure as needed.
