<p class="p">The ORYZA2000 model (Bouman et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) was developed in the 1990s. Since around 2010, improvements have been made in three different versions of this original model. At the international rice research institute (IRRI) ORYZAv3 was developed as a successor of ORYZA2000 (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The physiological part of ORYZA2000 (Bouman et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) has been integrated into APSIM, i.e. the “IRRI” rice plant is grown on top of an “APSIM” soil (Gaydon et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Uncertainties and recent improvements are discussed in (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) for ORYZAv3 and in (Gaydon et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) for APSIM‐ORYZA. Improvements by these two groups involved more accurately modelling soil processes (water × N interactions, soil carbon, root growth), multicrop sequences, effects of salinity on crop physiology (Radanielson, Angeles, Li, Ismail, &amp; Gaydon, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and interaction effects of water and N limitation on crop physiology. At the Africa Rice Centre, where the authors of this paper are employed, improvements have been made on heat sterility, cold sterility and phenology (Van Oort, De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The latter are of particular relevance in the context of climate change studies. Some new improvements are presented below. The new version used here is called ORYZA2000v2n14s1, which builds on the ORYZA2000v2n13s14 version (Van Oort, De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) which in turn is based on the original ORYZA2000 model (Bouman et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>).
