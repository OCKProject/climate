<p class="p">The ORYZA2000 crop growth model is a point‐based model, i.e. it is used to simulate rice yields for specific sites and does not model landscape hydrology. Input data can be weather station data or time series of weather data for specific pixels of gridded weather datasets. We first selected countries to cover the main rice growing areas and to assure that both irrigated and rainfed production areas were well‐represented. Selected sites within each country refer to individual pixels of 0.25
 <sup class="sup">°</sup> spatial resolution, the spatial resolution of the weather dataset. Pixels were selected such that they were located centrally in major rice regions and climate zones of selected countries (Grassini et al.,

According to the SPAM2005 data set, 26% of Africa's harvested rice area is irrigated, whereas in our dataset, the share of irrigated rice is slightly higher (32%).
