<p class="p">For selected sites we used daily weather data from the AgMERRA dataset, which contains daily weather data for crop modelling from 1980 to 2010 at 0.25 degrees spatial resolution (Ruane, Goldberg, &amp; Chryssanthacopoulos, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Many climate change impact studies have been using as a baseline a period in the past and not recent climate (White, Hoogenboom, Kimball, &amp; Wall, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Forced by circumstances we also did so here, because the AgMERRA dataset does not include data of the last 7 years and because the baseline year of the climate change scenario data was the year 2000. For irrigated sites we simulated for 5 years (1998–2002) centred around the year 2000, the baseline year of the RCP data. For rainfed sites we simulated for 9 years centred around the year 2000; for the rainfed rice we used more years to overcome chance selection of a few extremely wet or dry years. Seasonal temperature change data were added to these daily time series and specific CO
