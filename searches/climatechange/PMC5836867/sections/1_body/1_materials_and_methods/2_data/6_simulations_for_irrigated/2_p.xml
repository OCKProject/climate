 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>) simulated the possible changes in potential production, which is logical in Asia with its’ predominance of irrigated systems. According to (Balasubramanian et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) rice in Sub‐Sahara Africa is cultivated in four ecosystems: dryland (38% of the cultivated rice area), rainfed wetland (33%), deepwater and mangrove swamps (9%), and irrigated wetland (20%). Similar numbers can be obtained from Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>. For irrigated sites we simulated potential production, for rainfed rice we simulated water limited production. Both presume ample nutrient supply and no major problems of weeds, pests, diseases and soil toxicities. The only difference is that in water limited production, effects of drought are also simulated while under potential production the assumption is that no drought stress occurs (Bouman et al.,
