Bunding is frequently applied in lowland soils and rarely in upland soils. Percolation rates in the upland soils are often so high that any standing water would be lost anyway, whether through run‐off (in case of no bunding) or percolation (with bunding). Lowland soils typically have more clay and lower percolation rates, caused by sediment transport over the millennia and low hydraulic head in inland valley bottoms and flood plains. There is a continuum in the landscape position from the completely freely draining soils higher uphill towards the valley bottoms (Danvi, Jütten, Giertz, Zwart, &amp; Diekkrüger,
