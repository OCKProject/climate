<p class="p">Cropping calendar data were obtained from the RiceAtlas (Laborte et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). They were cross‐checked and locally adjusted where necessary using data collected by AfricaRice and national partners. For irrigated systems we simulated with the same average sowing date for each year. For rainfed systems this is not appropriate considering large interannual variabilities that exist in the starting dates of the wet season (Sultan, Baron, Dingkuhn, Sarr, &amp; Janicot, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). For rainfed systems, we searched for the first suitable sowing date within a ±30 days window around the average sowing date (from the RiceAtlas, possibly locally adjusted based on our data). A day was considered suitable if cumulative rainfall over the preceding 7 days was larger than 20 mm. This criterion was chosen based on a previous study by (Wolf, Ouattara, &amp; Supit, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This sowing rule has not been calibrated with farmers’ data and one may expect that it differs locally depending on local hydrological and climatic conditions but as a general rule of thumb we expect it to be more accurate than simply assuming a fixed sowing date.
