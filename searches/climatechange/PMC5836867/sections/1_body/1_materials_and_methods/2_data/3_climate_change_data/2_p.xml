<p class="p">We simulated four climate change scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathways RCP2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5; Van Vuuren et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) that differ in trend of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature. We used downscaled climate change scenario data (Ramirez &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) made available by the GCM Downscaled Data Portal (

We downloaded maps of maximum and minimum temperature for time slices of the 2000s and 2070s, for the four RCPs and 34 general circulation models (GCM), at the highest spatial resolution available (2.5 arc min). A listing of the available data per GCM and scenario is provided in Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>. In summary, we downloaded a total of 954 downscaled climate maps of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub>. Temperature maps were overlaid with maps of rice cultivated areas as identified by the MIRCA dataset (Portmann, Siebert, &amp; Doll, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). We then calculated seasonal average 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and average 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> over the months included in the growing seasons and over the GCM's available. For this purpose we used the growing seasons defined in the RiceAtlas database (Laborte et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Seasonal changes (2000s to 2070s) in 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were then added to the daily weather data. The full procedure is outlined in detail in (Zwart, 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) which also provides a link to the downloadable set of maps of changes per season and scenario for 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">min</sub>.
