<p class="p">We used the ORYZA2000v2n14s1 model to identify the main causes of future yield changes under climate change. In the model an elevated CO

 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> for an overview). From our simulation results two hypotheses emerged on which of the processes listed in Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref> were the main causes of simulated yield decline. The following two sections describe how we tested these hypotheses.
