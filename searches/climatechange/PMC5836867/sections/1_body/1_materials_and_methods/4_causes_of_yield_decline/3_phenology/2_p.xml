<p class="p">Development is faster at higher temperatures, leading to a shorter growing period and accordingly less time for accumulating biomass, hence lower yields. To investigate how much of the simulated yield loss was caused by shortening of the growing season we simulated scenarios in which growth duration would remain the same as in the year 2000. This analysis serves, firstly, to identify shortening growth duration as a cause of yield decline. Secondly, it can be considered an adaptation option for African rice farmers, showing what would happen if they would gradually replace their current varieties with new varieties that have a higher temperature sum, keeping pace with shortening of the season due to temperature rise. In the context of climate change, current varieties will have a shorter duration in the future and adapted varieties will have an unchanged duration (relative to the baseline year 2000) in the future.</p>
