<p class="p">ORYZA2000 simulates leaf photosynthesis at three times of the day (at different temperatures and radiation levels early morning, midday and late afternoon) and at three canopy depths and integrates over the canopy and the day to obtain the daily gross assimilation rate (Bouman et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Leaf photosynthesis in the model depends on leaf Nitrogen (N) content, intercepted radiation, atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration and air temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information</xref>). The daily maximum assimilation rate AMAX (kg CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>/ha leaf per hour) is multiplied with a trapezoid shaped temperature response function with a base at 10°C, optimum from 20 to 37°C and declining sharply as daytime average temperatures increase from 37 to 43°C (solid lines in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We tested if projected yield declines were caused by the sharp decline in AMAX from 37 to 43°C, by including a scenario in which AMAX was nondecreasing above 37°C (dashed lines in Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). It should be noted that virtually no experimental data have reported from this temperature range. If model outcomes show great sensitivity of simulated yields to this temperature response, in specific areas, then those areas can be targeted for further experimentation.
