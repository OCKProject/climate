<p class="p">Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">5</xref> shows the relative changes by country and environment for the most extreme scenario, RCP 8.5 in the year 2070. Figures 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> show the changes per site. The table as well as the maps show a gradient of yield decline in West Africa, with most severe yield decline in the hotter northern landlocked countries (Mali, Niger) and less in the cooler coastal countries of West Africa. In East Africa, all the cooler irrigated systems in the highlands (Kenya, Madagascar, Rwanda, Tanzania) benefit from climate change. For Egypt, for which we simulated only for the Nile delta, if varieties with unchanged duration are adopted, a small increase in yields (+6%) is simulated. Thus in Egypt yields do not increase as strongly as in the rest of East Africa (which is cooler) and do not decrease as strongly as in West Africa (which is hotter).
