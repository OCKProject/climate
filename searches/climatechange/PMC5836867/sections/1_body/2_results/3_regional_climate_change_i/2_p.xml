<p class="p">Yields from 2000 to 2070 are projected to decrease in all scenarios and environments (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). Average yield decline is lowest in RCP scenario 2.6 (−9%) and highest in RCP scenario 8.5 (−24%). In the scenario with adaptation (varieties with higher temperature sum, “unchanged duration”) yields slightly increased (+5% in RCP scenario 2.6, +8% in RCP scenario 8.5). Therefore, it can be concluded that shortening of the growing period is the main cause of projected yield decline and this effect is present in all sites and all growing environments. Once we account for the adaptation option referred to as “unchanged duration” we find systematically different responses to climate change depending on rice growing environment and region:
