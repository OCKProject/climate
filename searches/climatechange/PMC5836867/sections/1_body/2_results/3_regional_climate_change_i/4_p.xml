<p class="p">The difference between rainfed and irrigated rice indicates that frequently during the growing season the main production limiting factor is water and not CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and therefore rainfed rice benefits less from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization. East Africa irrigated rice yields increase as a result of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization and because temperatures are often below optimum. In West Africa irrigated rice in the hot dry season yields decrease because of reduced assimilation. In the scenario with nondecreasing AMAX, the negative effect on West Africa dry season irrigated rice change (−15%) changed into a positive effect (+11%). Simulations suggested that average heat induced sterility would hardly increase. Apparently stronger transpirational cooling and earlier flowering opening times at elevated temperatures are enough to offset temperature rise, leading to almost unchanged spikelet temperatures at flowering opening time. Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a shows that projected yield declines were not correlated with future spikelet fertility. Simulated yield declines were strongly correlated with the decline in maximum daily assimilation rate at daytime average temperatures above 37°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b).
