<p class="p">In many parts of the world dry (off) season irrigated crops yield more than wet (main) season irrigated crops, due to higher radiation levels in the dry season. Here the opposite was found, with on average lower potential yields in the dry (off) season. In West Africa this was caused by reduced assimilation at high temperatures in 16 hot inland irrigation systems along the Niger river (Mali, Niger, northern Nigeria, northern Benin) and the Benue in North East Nigeria. For the seven cooler irrigation systems in the coastal regions we did find higher simulated yields in the dry season (Mauritania: Rosso, Senegal: Ndiaye and Fanaye, Gambia: Sapu, Ghana: Yendi, Nigeria: Bida and Lokoja). This finding suggests that much of the dry season irrigated rice in the Sudano Sahel zone is around the 37°C tipping point (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) for which with further temperature rise dry season rice yields will decrease. Shifting rice sowing dates more into the cold dry season could be an adaptation option but might create logistic problems and human nutritional problems, because farmers now often use the cold dry season for growing vegetables (Van Oort et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13967-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In East Africa irrigated systems simulated dry season yields were lower than wet season yields because most of the simulations for dry season irrigation systems were for sites in the cold dry winter season in Madagascar, where cold is negatively affecting potential rice yields. This finding suggests that in the future with temperature rise, dry season irrigated rice in Madagascar will become an increasingly attractive option.
