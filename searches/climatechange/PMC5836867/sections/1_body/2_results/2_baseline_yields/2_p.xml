 <xref rid="gcb13967-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref> shows average baseline simulated yields around the year 2000, with in brackets the standard deviation, showing spatial and temporal variation. Potential yields are higher in irrigated systems than in rainfed systems and interannual variability is less in irrigated systems. Simulated rainfed yields are substantially lower in rainfed upland than in rainfed lowland, which is consistent with lower water availability in the upland soils. Variation in yields is higher for rainfed systems than for irrigated systems, which is consistent with greater risk caused by drought.
