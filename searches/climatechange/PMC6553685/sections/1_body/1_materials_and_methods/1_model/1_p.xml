<p class="p">Geophysical models in the climate science literature span a wide range of different complexities depending on the associated research objective. Highly complex models are the state-of-the-art for weather and climate prediction [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007000.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Here, we use minimal models for both social and climate dynamics. Starting simple allows us to build intuition on the effect of socio-climate feedbacks that have yet been considered in the climate change literature. The social model is widespread and, despite its simplicity, captures the salient aspects of social dynamics [
