<p id="P7" class="p">Conceptually, the interaction between climate change, forest productivity and disturbances can take eight pathways (P1–P8 in the following) which we characterize as ‘direct’ if the interaction is established through a clear cause-effect relationship while we use ‘indirect’ if the interaction is mediated through changes in the forest state (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>). According to this logic, the influence of climate change on productivity and disturbances can take four pathways (P1–P4) just like the interaction between forest productivity and disturbances (P5–P8).
