<p id="P23" class="p">To further test how CPC and CDPC interact, we only considered the difference of CPC and CDPC of those data points that represent the longest possible simulation period for each forest case study (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>). This analysis showed that in those forests where CPC was negative (left quadrants in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>, Chamusca and Black Forest), disturbances were exacerbating productivity losses. In Prades, disturbances alleviated productivity losses even though the CDPC remained negative. For North Wales and Montafon for which CPCs were positive (right quadrants in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>), disturbances were decreasing the positive CPCs but the CDPC remained positive. For the Southern Veluwe and North Karelia, the CDPC was slightly positive because the storm damage in these forests reduced competition among the remaining trees.
