<p id="P21" class="p">However, even if the patterns remained the same in most cases, including disturbances had negative effects on productivity, either by reducing positive CPCs or by exacerbating negative CPCs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). These decreases were rather small and range between −0.05% and −14.0%. In a few cases, including disturbances in the simulations increased positive CDCs but only in the managed Prades forest on deep soils this amounted to a tangible change of +21.1%. In some of the simulations for Prades (unmanaged forest on deep soils and managed forest on shallow soils) and Chamusca (simulation for 2041–2070) regions the negative climate change effects were partly alleviated by including disturbances. These positive effects of disturbances ranged between +1.1% to +9.0%.
