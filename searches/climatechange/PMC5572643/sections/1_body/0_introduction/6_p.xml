<p id="P6" class="p">We present projections of CPC and CDPC from state-of-the-art forest models (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1" class="xref">table 1</xref>) that dynamically simulate forest productivity and the main European disturbance agents (fire, storm, insects), driven by the same climate scenario in seven forest case studies over a large climatic gradient throughout Europe. We classify these models based on a conceptual framework of different pathways of forest productivity-disturbances-climate change interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">table 2</xref>) and use them to test how climate change-induced productivity changes are interacting with simultaneously changing disturbances.
