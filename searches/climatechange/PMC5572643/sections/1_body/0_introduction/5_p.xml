 <italic class="italic">climate-related productivity change</italic>’ (CPC), i.e. the change in forest productivity induced solely by climate change over a specific time period relative to a baseline period, to the ‘
 <italic class="italic">climate- and disturbance-related productivity change’ (CDPC)</italic>, i.e. the change in forest productivity resulting from the joint effects of climate change and disturbances over the same time period relative to a baseline period including disturbances. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of forest productivity changes in different forests in Europe under climate change, and partition these changes into effects induced by climate change alone and by climate change and disturbances.
