<p id="P31" class="p">While the extrapolation of our case study-based results to other types of forests and disturbances requires caution, we argue that our findings have important implications for the assessment of climate change impacts on forest products and services in Europe. On the one hand, higher productivity in a future that is characterized by increasing disturbances may mean that more damage to forests may occur, especially if accompanied by higher standing volume stocks. On the other hand, reduced productivity may mean that less biomass is ‘available to be damaged’ but also that what is damaged is more valuable from a resource availability perspective. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret climate change-induced productivity and disturbance changes jointly to capture the full range of climate change impacts on forests and to plan adaptation. Likewise, these findings are important since currently many model studies, also those relying on models operating at larger spatial scales up to the global level, show that higher productivity will result in higher carbon storage and hence continued carbon uptake from the atmosphere even though the role of disturbances is only cursorily accounted for in many models.</p>
