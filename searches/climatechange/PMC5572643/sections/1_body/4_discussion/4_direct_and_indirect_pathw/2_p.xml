<p id="P27" class="p">The classification of the models based on the conceptual framework of climate-productivity-disturbance interactions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>) demonstrates that most models are representing both direct and indirect effects of disturbances on productivity (P5–P6, 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2" class="xref">table 2</xref>). These models also include indirect effects of changes in productivity on disturbances (P8). However, no model covers all possible pathways and especially the direct effects of changes in productivity on disturbances are not explicitly represented in the set of models used here (P7), possibly because these models do not necessarily operate at the level of process detail required to capture these direct effects, e.g. by excluding leaf element stoichiometry or the role of carbohydrates in plant defense. Moreover, the models mostly cover one or two processes per pathway even though there might be more (e.g. bark beetle reproduction is affected by temperature in LandClim and PICUS but other climatic factors such as drought also play a role (
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Netherer and Schopf 2010</xref>). As our knowledge of these effects evolves the inclusion of such processes into forest models will become more important in the future. It is also important to note that some of the models used in this study also include ‘adaptive management responses’. The management changes according to the disturbance-productivity interactions under climate change by optimizing management to maintain stable resource flows (in Chamusca) or by reducing harvesting age to lower wind risks (in North Wales). More systematic studies of the effect and potential of management interventions to alleviate the effects of changing climate and disturbance regimes on forest productivity are hence needed.
