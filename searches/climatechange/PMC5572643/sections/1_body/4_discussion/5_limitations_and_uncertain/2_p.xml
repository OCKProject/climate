<p id="P29" class="p">One key limitation of our study is that we are relying only on one emission scenario from one climate model in each of the forest case studies, even though climate impacts differ in between emission scenarios and within emission scenarios when different climate models are considered (

Therefore, our simulations do not provide a systematic assessment of the uncertainties induced by climate models and future socio-economic development, but rather provide a first look into how climate change, disturbances and productivity changes are interacting. Moreover, the simulation results presented in this study focus on one main disturbance agent in each forest region to be affected by climate change even though forest productivity may be strongly affected by the occurrence of multiple, compounding and interacting disturbances (

Moreover, the models used in each forest case study are quite different in the way in which they incorporate the effects of climate change on productivity, and also their representation of disturbances. Therefore, comparing the impacts across different forests can only be done qualitatively, keeping in mind the differences in the models. Moreover, the forest case studies are themselves very different in terms of forest management, species choice etc which are all factors that determine the influence of climate change. Altogether, this means that more variation of the changes in forest productivity under climate change and disturbances than expressed by our results is to be expected. However, our results provide first indications of how climate change and disturbances may play out at larger spatial scales around our forest case studies and similar forest ecoregions.
