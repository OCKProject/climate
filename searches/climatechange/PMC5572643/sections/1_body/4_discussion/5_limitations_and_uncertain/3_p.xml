<p id="P30" class="p">Finally, this study has focused on the role of disturbances in particular. Future studies should aim at testing the interactions of all pathways of our conceptual framework to gain a full understanding of forest productivity-disturbances-climate change interactions. This could be achieved by developing and applying improved models of disturbance interactions based on experiments and observations of such interactions. Moreover, it would be necessary to study in greater depth whether our findings are consistent over different types of disturbances, stages of stand development, management regimes and soil conditions (which have proven to be very important in e.g. Prades). Such developments could then be integrated into larger-scale simulation models allowing upscaling from the case study level to the continental scale. However, it is important to consider that such largerâ€“scale models will be limited in terms of the number of disturbances and potential interactions that can be included whenever the disturbances are not only resulting from large-scale driving forces (such as extreme heat events depending on planetary waves (
