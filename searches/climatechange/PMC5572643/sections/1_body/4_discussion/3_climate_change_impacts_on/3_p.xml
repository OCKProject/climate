<p id="P26" class="p">Our results reveal interesting temporal patterns of CDPC. The mid-century peak in negative CDPC in the Black Forest region can be explained by two mechanisms: 1) at this time, most of the forest is in a susceptible stage and 2) the damage is so high that later, even though the climate change signal is stronger, less forest area is actually damaged. The combined effects of climate change and bark beetle disturbance lead to a replacement of the beetle’s host species Norway spruce with deciduous and more drought adapted tree species. Similar processes have been found to influence the projected long-term carbon stocks in Swiss forests (
