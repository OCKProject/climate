<p id="P24" class="p">This paper shows that climate change-induced productivity changes and disturbances interact in different forests in Europe. In most cases, including disturbances in the simulations clearly exaggerate ongoing productivity declines or cancel out climate change-induced productivity gains. In fewer cases and in some regions only, disturbances also increase productivity or alleviate climate-change induced productivity losses. Only in rather specific situations such as for Prades, they are a real ‘game changer’, turning a climate change-induced productivity loss into a productivity gain. However, in general, the contribution of disturbances to productivity changes compared to those induced by climate change alone is rather small. It is important to note though, that our focus on productivity means that we base the interpretation of our findings on long-term averages (

Even though this study does not allow us to quantify the individual contribution of the different productivity-disturbances-climate change interaction pathways, we show that indeed such interactions are operating in very different forests across Europe.
