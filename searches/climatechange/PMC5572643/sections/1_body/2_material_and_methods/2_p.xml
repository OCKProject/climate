<p id="P10" class="p">The seven forest case studies studied here are located in North Karelia (Finland), North Wales (United Kingdom), the South-east Veluwe (The Netherlands), Black Forest (Germany), Montafon (Austria), Prades (Spain) and Chamusca (Portugal). They provide a wide range of ecosystem services to society, are shaped by different climatic, edaphic and socio-economic environments and are characterized by varying disturbance regimes (

In each case study a specific forest model or differing chains of forest models were applied, utilizing the best available models for each system, and building on a large body of work on testing and evaluating these models for the respective ecosystems. We chose to use the best locally available models for each case study rather than a one-size-fits-all model in order to best capture the local ecosystem dynamics and disturbances, management legacies, species choices and responses to climate change. Consequently, the time periods analyzed and output indicators are not fully homogenized to account for constraints of respective models and local data availability (
