 <xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schelhaas 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic> 2015
 </xref>). Since the parameters of the height growth curve are linked to the site class, increasing productivity also means an increase in height growth leading to higher susceptibility to wind damage. There was no clear signal of climate change on wind climate in this case study, hence the historic wind climate was used.
