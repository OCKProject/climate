 </xref>), temperature and precipitation affect productivity by changing the photosynthetic carbon uptake. Climate change affects the predicted annual fire occurrence probability and fuel moisture. Moreover, drought-stressed trees with reduced amounts of mobile carbohydrates are more likely to die after fire. Changes in productivity modify forest structure and fuel loads and therefore also fire occurrence and severity since the probability of fire is estimated each year, according to the state of the forest (stand basal area, mean and degree of evenness of tree size) and the climatic conditions affecting fuel moisture. Once a fire occurs, it causes mortality plus a temporal (1–3 years) decrease in tree growth (

 </xref>). The decrease in tree growth can be compensated by ash fertilization or a ‘thinning from below effect’ of fire, depending on fire intensity and structure of the stand. The ‘thinning from below effect’ is in most cases a result of low to medium severity fires (non-stand-replacing fires) that modify stand structure and may reduce tree competition for water resources.
