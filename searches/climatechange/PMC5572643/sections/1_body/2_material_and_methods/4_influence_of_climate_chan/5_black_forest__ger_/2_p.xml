 </xref>). They lead to changes in bark beetle population dynamics. Moreover, LandClim accounts for the beetle-outbreak-triggering effect of windthrow by increased forest susceptibility to bark beetles in the vicinity (&lt;200 m) of windthrow patches and in relation to the windthrown spruce biomass (

For the simulations considered in this study, the frequency of and area of stochastically simulated windthrow events was assumed to remain constant under climate change, while bark beetles responded dynamically to a changing climate.
