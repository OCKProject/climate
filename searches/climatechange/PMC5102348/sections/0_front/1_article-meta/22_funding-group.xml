 <funding-statement class="funding-statement">This study was undertaken under the Indus Basin Programme of ICIMOD, funded in part by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID), through their financial support of core research at ICIMOD. This work is partly carried out by the Himalayan Adaptation, Water and Resilience (HI-AWARE) consortium under the Collaborative Adaptation Research Initiative in Africa and Asia (CARIAA) with financial support from the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and the International Development Research Centre (IDRC), Ottawa, Canada. This project has received funding from the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme (grant agreement 676819). In addition, this work was partially supported by core funds of ICIMOD contributed by the governments of Afghanistan, Australia, Austria, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, Norway, Pakistan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. DFID partly funds ICIMOD’s Indus Basin Programme, under which this study was undertaken. These funds partly supported the contributions of AFL, WWI and ABS. DFID and IDRC funds the HI-AWARE consortium, of which ICIMOD and FutureWater are consortium members. These funds partly supported the contributions of AFL, WWI and ABS. ERC partly funded the contribution of WWI through grant agreement 676819. ICIMOD core funds partly funded the contribution of ABS. AFL and WWI are employed by FutureWater. FutureWater provided support in the form of salaries for authors AFL and WWI, but did not have any additional role in the study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. The specific roles of these authors are articulated in the ‘author contributions’ section.</funding-statement>
