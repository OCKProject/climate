<p class="p">From our results we can conclude that the upper Indus basin faces a very uncertain future in terms of water availability in the long run. Projections of changes in water availability from the upper Indus basin at the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century range from -15% to +60% with respect to 1971â€“2000. This uncertainty mainly stems from the large spread in the projections of precipitation change throughout the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Therefore, formulating adequate adaptation measures which take into account the uncertain future is of vital importance, thus requiring hydrological projections to be made based on an ensemble of climate models representing all possible futures.
