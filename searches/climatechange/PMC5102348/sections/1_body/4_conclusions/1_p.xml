<p class="p">In this study we use a distributed hydrological model which we force with the latest suite of climate models using an advanced statistical downscaling technique. This study stands out from previous work as for the first time shifts in seasonal water availability are assessed in combination with changes in hydrological extremes at basin scale for the upper Indus basin.</p>
