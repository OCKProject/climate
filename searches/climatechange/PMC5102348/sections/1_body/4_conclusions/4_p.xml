<p class="p">Despite the large uncertainties in future climate and water availability, basin-wide patterns and trends of intra-annual shifts in water availability are consistent across climate change scenarios. These trends mainly consist of minor increases in summer flows combined with increased flows during other seasons in the near future (2021–2050) and decreases in summer flows combined with stronger increasing flows during the other seasons in the far future (2071–2100). Furthermore, increases in intensity and frequency of extreme discharges are found for most of the UIB and for most scenarios and models considered, implying increases in flooding events during the 21
