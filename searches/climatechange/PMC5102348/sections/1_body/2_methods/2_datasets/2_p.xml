<p class="p">As digital elevation model (DEM) we use the 15 arc-second void-filled and hydrologically conditioned HydroSHEDS DEM [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], which is based on the SRTM DEM [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. This DEM is resampled to 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> spatial resolution. Glacier outlines are extracted from the Randolph Glacier Inventory [
