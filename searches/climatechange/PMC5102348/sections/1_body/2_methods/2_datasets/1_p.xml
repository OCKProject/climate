<p class="p">Meteorological observations from stations are sparse in the mountains, in particular in the upper Indus. Data mostly originates from valley stations which are not representative for high altitude precipitation. The few stations that are located at higher elevations are typically subject to undercatch in case of snow [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Therefore, meteorological datasets consistently seem to underestimate precipitation in the UIB [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. As forcing for the SPHY-model we therefore use a corrected precipitation dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], which uses the observation-based APHRODITE [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>] dataset as a basis. In the corrected dataset, the raw APHRODITE precipitation data have been corrected by using the glacier mass balance of the major glacier systems as a proxy to estimate high altitude precipitation. Details of the methodology and dataset have been published before [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. The correction factors that were found in the referred study [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] for 2003–2007 are applied to the daily APHRODITE data for 1971–2000 to generate a 30-year reference climate dataset at 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> spatial resolution and daily timestep. By using this dataset we aim to overcome the fundamental problem of underestimated precipitation in distributed modeling of high-mountain hydrology. Because the 2003–2007 period for which the correction factors were derived [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] does not overlap with the 30-year reference period, and we cannot establish the correction factors for earlier periods due to the lack of IceSAT data [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>], we validate the correction factors for the 1971–2000 period by comparing the corrected precipitation amounts to observed discharge. We compare average annual precipitation amounts to average annual discharge amounts during periods falling entirely within 1971–2000 (
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>).
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> shows that the corrected precipitation amounts are in most cases higher than the observed discharge amounts, whereas the uncorrected precipitation amounts are almost all lower than the observed discharge amounts. Because of the systematic underestimation in high altitude precipitation, we conclude that the corrected precipitation dataset is appropriate to be used as historical precipitation forcing in our study.
