<p class="p">The transformation parameters are determined and five-day sums are transformed for each future period spanning 10 years, by using a moving 30-year window from the GCM future series centered around the 10 year future period under consideration. For example, in the calculation of the transformation parameters for 2061–2070, the GCM future series for 2051–2080 is used. For the last future ten-year period (2091–2100) the GCM future series for 2071–2100 is used, similar as for 2081–2090, because most GCM runs do not go beyond 2100. After transformation a change factor can be determined for each five-day sum, which can be subsequently used to transform the individual days that belong to that specific sum. The change factor R is determined as:
