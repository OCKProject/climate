 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Remotely sensed snow cover has proven to be useful to improve model calibration in areas with high snow cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. The same processed MOD10C2 dataset is used as has been used in another study [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref081" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. From the beginning of 2000 until halfway 2008 the snow cover imagery is averaged for 46 different periods of 8 days (5 days for the last period) to generate 46 different average snow cover maps. That means period 1 is the average snow cover for 1–8 January for 2000 until 2008, period 2 is the average snow cover for 9–16 January for 2000 until 2008, etc. Because the MODIS snow cover product is available at 0.05° x 0.05° spatial resolution, SPHY model snow cover output is averaged over 8 day periods, resampled and projected from 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> spatial resolution to the same time periods, resolution and geographic projection as the MODIS product. Parameters related to snow melt are optimised to minimize the difference between SPHY simulated snow cover and MODIS observed snow cover. Parameter values are optimized by running different manually sampled parameter values from the parameter ranges listed in 
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, and the combination of parameters that yields the smallest difference between simulated and observed snow cover is selected.
