Bajracharya). Using the model temperature and precipitation forcing, the glacier mass balances for the individual glaciers are simulated for October 1999 to September 2007. Accumulation is calculated as solid precipitation falling on the grid cells with fractional glacier cover and the adjacent grid cells with a slope steeper than 0.2 towards the glacier surface [
