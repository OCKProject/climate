The selection of locations is primarily dictated by data availability and data access. Secondly the selection is made such that it is a representative subset of the UIB, with different climatic and hydrological characteristics. Calibration is performed at a daily time step for the same periods for which stream flow records are available. Parameter optimization is done using PEST parameter estimation software (freeware, version 6.05) [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. The calibrated parameters are assumed to be spatially uniform, i.e. one set of parameters is calibrated and assumed to be applicable to the entire UIB.
