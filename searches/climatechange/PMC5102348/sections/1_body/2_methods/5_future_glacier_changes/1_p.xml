<p class="p">Future glacier changes are simulated at large scale for the UIB divided in three sub-regions: one sub-region for each of the mountain ranges Hindu Kush, Karakoram and Himalaya (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). For each of these three regions a regionalized glacier mass balance model is used to estimate changes in the regional glacier extent as a function of the glacier size distribution in the sub-regions and the downscaled future climate data [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. This glacier mass balance model is specifically developed for implementation in large-scale hydrological models, where the spatial resolution does not allow for the simulation of individual glaciers and data scarcity is an issue. The model is initially forced with the climatic forcing for the reference period and calibrated to sub-region-averaged glacier mass balance data derived from IceSAT data [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], before it is used to calculate sub-region-scale glacier changes for each of the downscaled GCM ensemble members from 2001 until 2100. The Randolph Glacier Inventory [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] is assumed to be representative for the state of the glacier extent at the start of the future simulation in 2001.
