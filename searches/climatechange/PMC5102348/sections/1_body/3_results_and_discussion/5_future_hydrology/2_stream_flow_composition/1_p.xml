<p class="p">The contribution of glacier melt is projected to decrease by the end of the century across all scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g007" class="xref">Fig 7a, 7d, 7g and 7j</xref>). For RCP8.5 the decrease is strongest for the wet, warm scenario and smallest for the dry, cold scenario. The changes in snow melt contribution also show a consistent signal across scenarios, but with high spatial variation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g007" class="xref">Fig 7b, 7e, 7h and 7k</xref>). The strongest decreases are projected for the Hindu Kush mountain range consistent with the high warming rates. In the Karakoram and in the Zanskar subbasin, the contribution of snow melt increases in favor of glacier melt, since the glacier area is reduced but seasonal snow still provides a considerable amount of melt water. Although the strongest precipitation increases are projected for the winter months (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6e and 6f</xref>), all year increases in temperature lead to a shift in the precipitation regime to more precipitation falling as rain instead of snow. For the ensemble means, averaged over the UIB the portion of the precipitation falling as rain changes from 58% during 1971–2000 to 66% during 2071–2100 for RCP4.5 and 75% for RCP8.5, consistent with earlier projections of changes in UIB snowfall [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. Remarkably, despite this shift in precipitation regime, snow melt contribution to total runoff increases or stays equal in most parts of the UIB except for the Kabul basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6b, 6e and 6h</xref>). This can be explained by the combined effect of increased evapotranspiration due to higher temperatures and increased water availability in the soil and a reduction of sublimation due to decreases in snow cover. For the western part of the Kabul basin the strongest increases in temperature are projected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6a and 6b</xref>), leading to a reduction in snow melt contribution and increase in rainfall-runoff contribution across scenarios. The RCP8.5 wet &amp; warm scenario leads to largest increases in rainfall-runoff contribution (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g007" class="xref">Fig 7l</xref>) and for this scenario the contribution of snow melt is mostly reduced (
