 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). For most rivers, the highest water levels occur during the coinciding melting and monsoon season, and therefore the changes in return levels are largely determined by the projected climate changes during those months. However, the peak flows are also significantly determined by the meltwater from snow and glacier melt stemming from winter precipitation, forming a basic flow level during the melting and monsoon season which is exacerbated by runoff originating from extreme precipitation events.
