<p class="p">The model runs forced with the RCP8.5 MIROC5 and CSIRO-Mk3 GCMs clearly stand out from the other model runs for Satluj, Shyok, and the Indus at Tarbela, projecting the wettest future and strongest increases in precipitation intensity. Since the uncertainty in future climate is larger for the RCP8.5 ensemble compared to the RCP4.5 ensemble, it is not surprising that the range of the projected return levels is also larger for the RCP8.5 ensemble.</p>
