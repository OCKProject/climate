<p class="p">The return levels for extreme discharges at Tarbela, where the main Indus branch leaves the UIB, increase for most scenarios as well, except the RCP8.5 dry &amp; warm scenario, because precipitation events are projected to be more intense across the climate model ensemble. At Tarbela, the most extreme changes in return levels are projected for the RCP8.5 wet &amp; warm scenario, with 100-years return level increasing by more than 100% between 1971–2000 and 2071–2100.</p>
