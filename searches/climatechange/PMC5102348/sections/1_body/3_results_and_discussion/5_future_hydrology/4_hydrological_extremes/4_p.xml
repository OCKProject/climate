<p class="p">For the Shyok basin, return levels clearly increase most for the RCP8.5 wet &amp; warm scenario, which also project the largest precipitation increases. Interestingly, the RCP4.5 wet &amp; warm scenario projects stronger return level increases for the near future compared to the far future, despite increasing precipitation intensity. Since the Shyok river has a large glacier melt contribution, this is related to the lower continuous flow from glacier melt during the melting season in the far future.</p>
