<p class="p">At the outlet of the rainfall-runoff dominated Satluj basin the range of projected changes in return levels is largest. As this is the most rainfall-runoff dominated river, the discharge of this river is also most sensitive to changes in extreme precipitation. In addition, precipitation projections have large spread for this part of the UIB (
