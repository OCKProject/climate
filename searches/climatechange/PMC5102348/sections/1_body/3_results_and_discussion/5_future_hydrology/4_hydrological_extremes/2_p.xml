<p class="p">Remarkably, the return levels for extreme discharges in the very upstream Hunza river with its highly glaciated basin increase for all scenarios, including the scenarios projecting overall dryer conditions. For the Hunza river with a large contribution of glacier melt, the decreases in glacier extent play a large role, lowering the continuous flow from glacier melt during the melting season. Nevertheless, even for the far future, when the contribution of glacier melt and the total flow has significantly decreased, the extremes in discharge are clearly increasing, due to increases in extreme precipitation, across scenarios. Earlier work in the Shigar subbasin to the east of Hunza also indicates that hydrological extremes may considerably increase until the end of the century [
