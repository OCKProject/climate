<p class="p">In terms of total water availability, the RCP8.5 ensemble shows quite contrasting projections with increases in annual water availability in the near and far future. The patterns in the shifts in the ensemble mean projection however are consistent with RCP4.5, implying a transition to a more attenuated hydrograph. That flows increase during all parts of the year, including the high flow season, is most likely because precipitation is projected to increase for all seasons except spring and glacier melt rates in the near future increase stronger compared to RCP4.5 due to stronger temperature increase. Earlier onset of melt in spring causes runoff to increase during spring despite reduced precipitation input during this season. The projection for the far future shows that despite strong precipitation increases, the glacier-melt dominated Chitral, Hunza, Gilgit and Shigar subbasins experience reductions in flow during the high flow season, since the glacier extent has decreased strongly by then (

Besides, the contrast in the precipitation projections between the Kabul subbasin and the remaining part of the UIB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6d</xref>) are also visible in the projections of changes in total water availability. The remarkable strong year-round increase in flows in the near future as well as far future for the Shyok subbasin, can most likely be explained by the fact that projected precipitation increases are strongest in this subbasin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6d</xref>). Similarly strong year-round increases in flow for the rain-dominated Satluj river can be explained by strong precipitation increases in this subbasin.
