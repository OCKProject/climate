<p class="p">The patterns are consistent for both RCPs, but the uncertainty is large: for the combined RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 ensembles total water supply from the UIB in 2071–2100 changes by -15% to +60% with respect to 1971–2000. Large uncertainties in hydrological projections have also been found earlier for the Shigar catchment [
