There, the initial increase of summer flows is projected halfway through the century followed by a decline at the end of the century, that is accompanied by increasing flows in spring. A previous study projects increasing flow in the UIB until the end of the 21

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The authors assessed changes for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and used one downscaled GCM and one RCM for their projections. They project stronger increase in winter flows compared to summer flows, consistent with our results. Similar results were found using the previous generation IPCC scenarios A2 and B2 for one RCM [
