For most catchments (1–13) in the near future (2021–2050) for RCP4.5, flows show little changes during the high flow season and increase during autumn and especially spring. This is most likely due to an increase in autumn and winter precipitation (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6c</xref>), annual-averaged water availability is unchanged for the locations in the Indus river (6–12), and increases slightly for the upstream subbasins of Hunza, Shigar and Shyok. For Hunza and Shigar this is most likely related to increased glacier melt, and for the Shyok basin upstream of Yogo it is a combination of precipitation increases for the mean of the scenarios (

The lower altitude subbasins (14–17) show a different pattern of seasonal shifts, with strong decreases in flow during June and July and often also for the spring months. Autumn and winter flows increase slightly, and annual-averaged water availability decreases slightly for these sub-basins. These basins have large rainfall-runoff and snow melt components, and decreases in precipitation during spring and the monsoon season combined with higher evapotranspiration rates, most likely cause runoff to decrease during those months, whereas precipitation increases during the winter months, cause increasing runoff during winter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6e</xref>). For the end of the century (2071–2100), the mean projection for RCP4.5 shows similar changes in intra-annual water distribution as for the near future, but much more pronounced. As glacier areas have reduced significantly by then, the amount of glacier melt water decreases substantially, causing reductions in discharge during the summer months. In addition, flows in the high flow season decline further by reduced precipitation during the monsoon season, and total water availability decreases for the entire UIB due to reduced precipitation in combination with increased evapotranspiration. Flows in spring tend to increase more strongly due to earlier onset of snow and glacier melt during these months. Only for the Satluj river, being the most rain-dominated river in the UIB, increases in water availability are projected for the far future according to the RCP4.5 ensemble mean since precipitation is projected to increase for this part of the UIB (
