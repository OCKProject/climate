<p class="p">The downscaled GCM ensembles for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 show that the future climate in the UIB is highly uncertain. Both ensembles indicate strong warming (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6a and 6b</xref>), with significantly stronger warming for the parts of the basin with the highest elevation. The difference in warming can be up to ∼1°C (RCP4.5) and ∼2°C (RCP8.5) between the lowest and the highest areas in the UIB. This is well in line with presently observed elevation-dependent warming [

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">105</xref>]. Comparing the average warming in the UIB (+2.1 to +8.0°C between 1971–2000 and 2071–2100) to the global average (+1.8 to +4.4 between the same periods for the same RCPs [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]), also demonstrates that the UIB is likely to warm stronger than other parts in the world. The uncertainty in warming is largest in the eastern and northern parts of the UIB. Seasonal differences in the temperature projections are limited. For both RCPs, strongest temperature increases are projected for January and June (
