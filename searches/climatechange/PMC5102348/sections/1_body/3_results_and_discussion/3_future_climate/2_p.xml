<p class="p">The precipitation projections are highly uncertain. The RCP4.5 mean projection shows clear contrasting trends of precipitation increase in the southeastern part and precipitation decrease in the northwestern part of the UIB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6c</xref>). This contrast is also observed for the RCP8.5 mean projection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6d</xref>), although the area with a projected increase in precipitation is larger. Besides, the precipitation increase is much higher for RCP8.5 than for RCP4.5, and the magnitude of precipitation decrease is smaller. The range of the precipitation projections however is very large. For both ensembles, for each geographical location there are both ensemble members that predict an increase and a decrease in precipitation. The ensemble range is much larger for RCP8.5 compared to RCP4.5 and can be up to 100% for the most downstream parts. The mean projected precipitation trend in the southeastern parts of the UIB suggest that monsoon intensity increases, and that the monsoon protrudes further to the northwest with increasing temperatures. Averaged over the UIB, significant seasonal patterns can be observed in the precipitation projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g006" class="xref">Fig 6e and 6f</xref>). In general, although subject to a large uncertainty, the mean projection in both ensembles is indicating precipitation decrease during February-May and increase in October-January, with the increase being strongest in October. Especially the months October through January have very large uncertainties in RCP8.5. Despite this large uncertainty, an increase in precipitation is likely. Shifts in precipitation patterns originating from westerly disturbances are more difficult to interpret. The increasing precipitation during winter months combined with decreases during the early spring months could suggest that the westerly disturbances set in earlier, however the spatial pattern reveals mostly a precipitation decrease (on annual scale) in those areas where westerly disturbances are the main contributor to total precipitation. The trends, and large uncertainties of precipitation change we find in our ensembles are similar to what was found in an analysis of 32 CMIP5 GCMs over the Hindu-Kush-Karakoram-Himalaya region [
