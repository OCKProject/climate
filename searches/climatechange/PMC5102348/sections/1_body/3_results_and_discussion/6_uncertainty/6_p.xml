<p class="p">Parameters themselves have their own uncertainties, which are ideally all taken into account. A study compared three sources of model uncertainty (model parameters, climate projections, natural climate variability) for future projections for a hydrological modeling study in the Hunza subbasin [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref123" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">123</xref>]. The study showed that, for heavily glacierized basins, the uncertainty stemming from parameter uncertainty often exceeds the uncertainty stemming from uncertainty in the future climate and natural climate variability. In the cited study an ensemble of three GCMs was used. When a larger ensemble of climate models with a wide range of projections is used, like in our study, the uncertainty stemming from uncertainty in the future climate is probably larger. By calibrating model parameters in a three-step approach using geodetic glacier mass balance data, snow cover data, and observed discharge, the parameter uncertainty is reduced, because the model parameters are constrained to the processes they are affecting, reducing equifinality problems [
