<p class="p">This study sheds light on the propagation of uncertainty in the future climate for the future hydrology. We emphasize that the future climate in the upper Indus basin is highly uncertain as none of the current state-of-the art GCMs and RCMs satisfactory simulates the monsoon and westerly dynamics in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">112</xref>], making the reliability of future scenarios questionable. We stress the importance of improvement in the representation of the complex climate in High Mountain Asia in order to be able to narrow down the uncertainty in future projections.
