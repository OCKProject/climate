<p class="p">Uncertainties in the mapping of glacier extent have implications for the simulated contribution of glacier melt to the total flow. For the Karakoram range, the total glacier area according to three different glacier inventories varies from 21193 to 26018 km

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref124" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">124</xref>], and thus the inventory used will have large consequences for the simulated amounts of glacier melt during the reference period and may also lead to different simulated hydrological responses to climate change. The glacier inventory also determines the initial glacier volume, which is used as a starting point for the simulation of glacier change projections, which is based on volume-area scaling in our approach [

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. Besides, the method which is used to estimate initial ice volume from glacier outlines can also vary. A comparison of six different methods to calculate ice volume showed ice volume in the Karakoram ranging from 1683 to 2827 km2 (i.e. the highest estimate being ∼68% larger than the lowest estimate) [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref126" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">126</xref>]. More uncertainties are involved in the glacier change projections as discussed in earlier published work [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Currently no basin-wide map with distinction of debris-free and debris-covered glaciers is available for the UIB, and thus the differentiation of both glacier surface types is based on assumptions of elevation and slope constraints controlling the glacier surface type. A map with distinction of both glacier surface types would solve this key issue. Another key issue is the limited understanding of the role of sublimation in the high mountain water balance [
