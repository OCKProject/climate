<p class="p">Besides the uncertainty within climate model ensembles, climate models themselves, and empirical-statistical downscaling, additional uncertainties are introduced in the hydrological model forcing and other data, parameters, and representation of physical processes. Precipitation products show a large range of precipitation amounts for High Mountain Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Although we use climate model forcing that is corrected for the underestimate of high-altitude precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], these data can still have large biases. For example, the UIB-averaged corrected precipitation is estimated to be 913Â±323 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> between 2003 and 2007. Another study assessed precipitation in the UIB based on station data and precipitation estimates for the accumulation zones of major glaciers [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The study found similar precipitation totals as reported in the dataset which we used for our study [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], providing further confidence in the used precipitation input. Further narrowing down of the uncertainty in historical precipitation data is a prerequisite for better estimates of future climate change impacts [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">120</xref>]. Similarly, air temperature datasets show a large spread over the UIB. An analysis of the sensitivity of glacier melt water amounts to the large variation in baseline air temperature data shows that variation can lead to an estimated glacier melt contribution to total flow varying from 4 to 78% for the baseline climate, and even larger variations in future projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref121" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. Important data used in this study that also introduce uncertainty are the subregion-averaged glacier mass balance data derived from IceSAT data [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], since they are used for the calibration of the large scale glacier change parameterization.
