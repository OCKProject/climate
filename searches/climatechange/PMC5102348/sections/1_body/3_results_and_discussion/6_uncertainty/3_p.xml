<p class="p">There are many different statistical downscaling approaches and choosing the most appropriate method is challenging, especially for areas with complex climate and terrain like the UIB. A study comparing different empirical-statistical downscaling methods for precipitation in the Austrian Alps concludes that methods which apply a non-linear transformation, like ADC does, are among the best performing approaches over terrain with complex topography [

Although the ADC method was not specifically developed for application in the Hindu Kush-Himalayan region and we could not validate its performance this does provide confidence in its applicability. As in any study projecting future changes in extremes, the uncertainty of the downscaled projections increases with the return period of the events, because these only occupy a very small part of the precipitation intensity distribution. In addition, the ADC method focuses on proper transformation of multi-day precipitation events, assuming these to be the main driver of flooding events. Although we believe that multi-day precipitation events are also the main driver of flooding events in the UIB, future studies should also pay particular attention to changes in multi-day events of high air temperature during the melting season, as these are probably also important drivers of flooding events in the upstream parts of the UIB. In that respect it would be recommendable to test the application of the Quantile Mapping [e.g.
