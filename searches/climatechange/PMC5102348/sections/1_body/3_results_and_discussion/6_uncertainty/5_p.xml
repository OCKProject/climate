<p class="p">Uncertainties are introduced by using a uniform set of calibrated model parameters for the entire domain. The values of most of the calibrated parameters vary in space and time in reality. However, due to the lack of data which can be used for calibration that covers the entire UIB, we are limited to calibrate the parameters for different subareas and limited temporal periods of our model domain and extrapolate them to larger areas and time periods. This is a common problem in model calibration for data-scarce areas like the UIB [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. The increasing availability of geodetic glacier mass balance data can help to calibrate spatial variation in degree-day factors for glacier melt, and this can potentially also be done for degree-day factors of snow using MODIS snow cover data. The calibration of parameters which are calibrated using observed discharge are limited to the subbasins which have discharge data available. Different sets of parameters could have been calibrated for each of the gauged subbasins, but then difficulties would arise in assigning parameter values to the ungauged part of the basin. This could in the future potentially be (partly) overcome by categorizing subcatchments by different characteristics, such as climatic differences, degree of glaciation and catchment size. Parameters could then be calibrated for gauged catchments and transferred to ungauged catchments. The potential of such approaches [
