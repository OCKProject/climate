<p class="p">The ensemble of selected climate models determines the outcome of a climate change impact study to a large extent. In this study, climate models to be included in the climate model ensemble have been selected based on the envelope of projections of mean air temperature and precipitation totals. Other selection approaches, based on climate model skill [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref113" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">113</xref>], changes in multiple climate properties [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref114" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">114</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">115</xref>], or a combination of envelope and skill [e.g. 
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] will lead to different climate model ensembles and thus to different projections of climate change and its impacts.
