 <xref rid="pone.0165630.t005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Even though the wet scenarios project large increases in precipitation, glacier area decreases considerably during the 21st century throughout the basin, since the precipitation increases cannot compensate for the ample rises in temperature. Our projections are in the same order as projections made in recent other studies at large scale [
