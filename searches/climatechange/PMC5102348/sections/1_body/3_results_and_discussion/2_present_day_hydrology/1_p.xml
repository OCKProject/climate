<p class="p">The stream flow compositions during the reference period have a large spatial variation in the UIB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). Strong south to north and east to west gradients are visible in the intensity of the rainfall-runoff generation, consistent with the intensity of the monsoon that comes in from the southeast during the monsoon season. In the monsoon-dominated Sutlej basin the contribution of rainfall to the total flow at the outlet is 74%, whereas this is 33% for the Indus at Tarbela. Snow melt has highest importance in the water coming from the Hindu Kush mountains in the Kabul basin, which receive large amounts of solid precipitation from westerly disturbances during the winter months. Glacier melt contribution is highest in the most glaciated Karakoram subbasins, like Hunza (85%) and Shigar (43%), and the upstream reaches of Kunar. This makes the Indus river the most melt-water dependent river leaving the UIB (55% glacier- and snow melt at Tarbela). The lower-latitude Satluj, Beas, Ravi, Chenab and Jhelum rivers are dominated by input from rainfall, most of which falls during the monsoon season. The Jhelum river also has a substantial snow melt component (32%). Our estimates of stream flow composition match reasonably well with what others found based on a conceptual model [

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. The results from this study show a slight shift in runoff composition towards higher contribution of snow melt and rainfall and lower contribution of glacier melt compared to our earlier findings [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This is because the current study is focused on the UIB only whereas the earlier study comprised the upstream basins of five Asian rivers, and most importantly because in the current study we use precipitation forcing that is corrected for the underestimate of high altitude precipitation, whereas this was not available at the time of the 2014 study. In the 2014 results, the shortage of precipitation input is compensated by higher glacier melt rates when calibrated only to observed stream flow, a common problem in the simulation of mountain hydrology [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Associated to the large differences in the stream flow composition between the tributaries are also differences in the intra-annual distribution of river discharge. Although the peak of glacier melt largely coincides with the peak in monsoonal rains, the snow melt peak occurs during spring. These contrasts in hydrological regimes and stream flow composition of the different tributaries feeding the downstream basin may lead to different responses to future climate change.
