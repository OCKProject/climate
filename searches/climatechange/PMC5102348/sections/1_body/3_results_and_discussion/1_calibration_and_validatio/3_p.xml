<p class="p">Calibration to observed discharge shows that averaged over the two locations, the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref103" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>] calculated at a daily time step equals 0.81, whereas Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient equals 0.92 (
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). For the location at Tarbela, covering a large part of the Indus basin, there is a positive bias of 9.7% in the simulation. The bias is largest during the months with high contribution of snow melt to the discharge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g004" class="xref">Fig 4a</xref>), and is thus likely related to the overestimate of snow cover on the part of the Tibetan Plateau that is part of this catchment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g003" class="xref">Fig 3d</xref>), which in turn relates to the high precipitation forcing in spring. For the Jhelum basin upstream of Mangla reservoir, with a large contribution of snow melt to the stream flow, the model simulates the seasonal patterns in stream flow well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g004" class="xref">Fig 4b</xref>). For the Hunza basin upstream of Dainyor bridge, which harbours the highest and most scarcely monitored part of the UIB and is used for model validation, simulated stream flow is slightly underestimated during the peak season in July and August, and overestimated during September and October (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g004" class="xref">Fig 4c</xref>). During these months the stream flow is dominated by glacier melt, which is driven by air temperature. This suggests that the APHRODITE temperature fields may lack some accuracy for this area where observations are very scarce. Besides the model slightly underestimates snow cover in the northern part of the Hunza basin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g003" class="xref">Fig 3c</xref>), which may contribute to the underestimate of the flow peak. For the Chenab basin, located to the southeast of the Jhelum basin, the model underestimates the flow during July and August, leading to a large negative bias (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g004" class="xref">Fig 4d</xref>). In this case the bias is most likely related to a shortage of precipitation in the forcing data, being 1222 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for the validation period whereas the observed discharge is only slightly lower (1100 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>).
