 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g003" class="xref">Fig 3b</xref>). The interquartile range is also similar. However, the total spread within the sample of 30 individual glaciers is larger in the simulation than in the observations. The larger spread in the simulation stems most probably from the quite coarse model resolution at 1 km

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) fall well within the range of values derived in field experiments in the greater Hindu-Kush-Himalayan region [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref098" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">98</xref>]. Given the large scale and the fact that we use a fixed parameter set for all glaciers we conclude that the calibrated parameters can be considered representative for the UIB.
