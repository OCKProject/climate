<p class="p">The annual water balance for 2003–2007, largely coinciding with the period covered by IceSAT derived glacier mass balances for three sub-zones in the UIB (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), is plausible for the Indus upstream of Besham Qila with precipitation input being 664 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, the negative glacier mass balance contributing 25 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and evapotranspiration, sublimation and discharge being 174 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, 139 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> and 367 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, respectively on the other side of the water balance. The gap in the water balance of 9 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is negligible and can be attributed to changes in storages in the soil, snow cover and groundwater. Given the complexity of high mountain hydrology, the scale of the application, the use of one parameter set for the entire basin, and large uncertainties in the meteorological model forcing, we conclude that the model performance is satisfactory for our purpose to estimate the impacts of climate change for the UIB’s future hydrology.
