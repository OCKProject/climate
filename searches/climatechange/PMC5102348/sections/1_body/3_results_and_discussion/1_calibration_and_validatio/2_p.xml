<p class="p">Averaged over the UIB, the calibrated SPHY model simulates snow cover reasonably well (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g003" class="xref">Fig 3c and 3d</xref>). The largest overestimates occur in the Karakoram range and the Himalayan range in the most southeastern part of the UIB. The largest underestimates occur in the Hindu Kush and mountain ranges to the south of the Karakoram. At the basin scale, there is also a slight overestimation of snow cover during most parts of the year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g003" class="xref">Fig 3d</xref>). Overestimates may well be related to the fact that snow redistribution by wind from one grid cell to another is not included in the SPHY model. Another explanation could be related to the simple approach used to estimate sublimation, whereas sublimation can potentially be an important component of the high-altitude water balance in the HKH region [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref099" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">99</xref>]. Studies in other areas revealed that blowing snow sublimation plays a larger role than ground sublimation from the snow pack, and that sublimation losses can be in the order of tens of percents of the total snow accumulation, and up to ∼90% on very windy ridges [
