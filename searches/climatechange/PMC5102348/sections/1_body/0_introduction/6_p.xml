<p class="p">Hydrological impact studies have been conducted for the UIB at various spatial scales and key assumptions in those studies relate to (i) the reference climate dataset being used, (ii) the future climate forcing and downscaling method, (iii) the type and complexity of the hydrological model, (iv) the treatment of glacier evolution in the future and (v) the calibration and validation strategy. Hydrological projections based on different approaches indicate likely increases in flow at least during the first half of the 21
