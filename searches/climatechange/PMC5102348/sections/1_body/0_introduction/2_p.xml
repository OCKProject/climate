<p class="p">The UIB has a complex climate. Several studies investigated historical trends in precipitation and temperature in the UIB. Trend analysis on precipitation for 17 stations throughout the UIB showed statistically significant increasing trends in precipitation for several stations in annual, summer and winter precipitation between 1961 and 1990 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Air temperature trends between 1961 and 2000 were also assessed and it was found that (i) the diurnal temperature range is increasing consistently in all seasons, (ii) winter mean and maximum temperatures show significant increases and (iii) mean and minimum summer temperatures show a consistent declining trend [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. These findings were confirmed also for a more recent period (1980â€“2009) for roughly the same stations [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) showed negative summer temperature trends from 1958 until 1990 and a positive trend from 1991 to 2001 [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The authors also found an increasing trend in annual precipitation from 1970 to 1990 and a decreasing trend during the 1990s. Trend analysis on several gridded precipitation products did not confirm these findings [
 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Studies on the winter westerly disturbances, being the major source of winter precipitation, indicate strong intra-seasonal variability and a trend of enhanced frequency and strength of these disturbances in the Karakoram and western Himalaya between 1979 and 2010, leading to increased heavy winter precipitation [
