<p class="p">There is great debate on the response of glaciers in the UIB to climate change during the last decade. The glaciers in the Himalayan range are seemingly losing mass at rates similar to other mountainous regions in the world, however the glaciers in the Karakoram and Pamir mountain ranges have neutral mass balances on average and are characterized by a large number of surging glaciers [

 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. This so called Karakoram anomaly has not been explained, but a possible reason could be a combination of a decrease in summer temperatures and an increase in precipitation. However this is still speculative and requires further study and understanding of atmospheric processes leading to high-altitude precipitation. This hypothesis is supported by an increasing trend in snow cover that was found in the Hunza basin based on MODIS snow cover analysis [
