 <xref rid="pone.0165630.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Along the Himalayan arc the monsoon influence is largest but this influence decreases in north-western direction where mid-latitude westerlies become increasingly important, e.g. at the junction of the Karakoram, Pamir and Hindu-Kush mountain ranges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0165630.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Precipitation from the westerlies is highest in winter when low-pressure systems reach the western margin of the greater Himalaya. This supply of moisture reaches higher elevations than the summer monsoon, which might be related to the higher tropospheric extent of the westerly airflow [
