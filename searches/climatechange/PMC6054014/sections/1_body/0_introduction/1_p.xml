<p id="Par2" class="p">In anticipation of the conclusion of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, countries were asked to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) for climate action to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The agreement legally entered into force on 4 November 2016 after the threshold requirements were met. Although specific modalities and procedures still have to be negotiated, the INDCs are set to become Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and will form the basis for implementation for the parties that ratified the Paris Agreement. As of October 2016, 162 INDCs were submitted, representing a total of 189 countries as the European Union (EU) submitted a single INDC for all of its 28 member states. Agriculture is mentioned in 121 countries as one of the sectors where emission reductions are intended, but so far only a few of them set quantitative targets for agriculture (Richards et al.
