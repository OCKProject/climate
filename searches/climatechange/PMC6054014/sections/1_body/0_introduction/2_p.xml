<p id="Par3" class="p">The agricultural sector is a large contributor of non-carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, namely methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) from livestock, manure management, fertilizer use, rice (

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1" class="xref">1</xref> Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> shows that China (13.4%), India (12%), Brazil (8.5%), the United States of America (USA) (6.8%) and the aggregated 28 member states of the EU (7.7%) together account for almost 50% of global agriculture emissions. However, from the EU, only France (1.3%) and Germany (1.1%) belong to the 22 countries with a share exceeding 1.0% of global agriculture GHG emissions. On the other hand, with respect to the EU, France (19%), Germany (15%) and the UK (11%) together account for about 45% of total EU agriculture emissions, with the next highest contributions from Spain, Poland and Italy (8% each).
