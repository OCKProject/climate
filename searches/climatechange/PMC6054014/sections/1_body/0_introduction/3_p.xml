<p id="Par5" class="p">Depending on the relative size and importance of the agricultural sector, the share of agriculture in total national GHG emissions varies substantially among countries. Analysing data from National Communications to the UNFCCC, Richards et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>) found that on average, agriculture contributes about 30% to national GHG emissions (excluding emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF)). This is higher than the estimated 10â€“12% contribution of agriculture to global emissions because of a large number of countries where agriculture emissions are relatively important in national GHG emissions even though they are rather small in absolute terms. In 42 low-income developing countries, agriculture contributes more than 50% to national emissions, whereas on average it is 35% in developing countries and 12% in developed countries (Richards et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows that in the major contributors to global agriculture emissions (presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the share of agriculture in national GHG emissions is quite diverse (e.g. 46% in Brazil, 23% in India, 11% in China and 8% in the USA). In the EU as a whole, agriculture contributes about 10% to total GHG emissions, but respective shares in the member states are also very diverse: the highest in Ireland (31%) and the lowest in Malta (2.5%).
