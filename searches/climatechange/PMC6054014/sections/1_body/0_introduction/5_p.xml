<p id="Par7" class="p">Against this background, the purpose of this paper is to highlight and discuss potential impacts and major challenges of integrating agriculture into national and international climate change mitigation policy frameworks and strategies. More precisely, we want to address two questions: What would be the effects on production, prices, income, consumption, trade and emission leakage if countries rigidly applied national GHG mitigation targets onto their agriculture sector? What are the major challenges that have to be tackled for an efficient and effective emission reduction policy in the agriculture sector? To address these questions, we take the EU as case a study. There are at least two reasons for this selection: (i) the EU shows a very diversified structure of the absolute and relative importance of agricultural emissions within its member states, reflecting the respective global diversity indicated above and (ii) in its INDC, the EU committed to reducing GHG emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels (European Council

Similar to most other parties to the Paris Agreement, specific EU legislative measures still have to be negotiated, including national mitigation targets for the member states and the specific way the agricultural sector will be included in the mitigation strategy. Therefore, we model an illustrative scenario that simulates a rigid implementation of non-uniform mitigation targets for EU agriculture according to a distribution key that is based on current national targets for the EU member states. Scenario results allow us to highlight and discuss key challenges significant not only for the EU but also relevant globally with respect to the integration of agriculture into national and global climate change mitigation strategies.
