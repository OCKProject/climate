<p id="Par9" class="p">The regional supply models in CAPRI capture links between agricultural production activities in detail. Based on the inputs and outputs of these activities, agricultural GHG emissions are endogenously calculated according to the IPCC (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2006</xref>) tier 2 method for the most important drivers. For activities where the respective information is missing, a tier 1 approach is applied to calculate GHG emissions (e.g. rice cultivation). The CAPRI reporting of agriculture GHG emissions mimics the reporting of emissions by the EU to the UNFCCC, that is, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 21 for methane and 310 for nitrous oxide is assumed. A more detailed description of the general calculation of agricultural emission inventories in CAPRI on activity level is given in Pérez Domínguez (
