<p id="Par8" class="p">For the quantitative analysis, we employ an adjusted version of the Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact Analysis (CAPRI) modelling system. CAPRI is a large-scale economic comparative-static, global multi-commodity, agricultural sector model. The model is frequently used for assessing the impact of agricultural, environmental and trade policies on agricultural production, trade, prices and income as well as environmental indicators in a consistent framework. Although the model focuses on the EU (on regional, member state and aggregated EU level), it is a global model as it covers global bilateral trade for major agricultural commodities. CAPRI consists of two interacting modules: a supply module and a market module. The supply module comprises independent aggregate optimization models representing agricultural activities (28 crop and 13 animal activities) in all 273 Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS)2 regions within the EU. The market module consists of a spatial, global multi-commodity model for 47 primary and processed agricultural products, covering 77 countries in 40 trade blocks. The behavioural functions for supply, human consumption, feed and processing in the market module are all differentiated by commodity and geographical units and apply flexible functional forms so that calibration algorithms ensure full compliance with microeconomic theory. The link between the supply and market modules is based on an iterative procedure until an equilibrium is obtained (Britz and Witzke
