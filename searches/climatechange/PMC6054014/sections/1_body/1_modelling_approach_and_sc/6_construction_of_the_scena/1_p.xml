<p id="Par39" class="p">We construct a reference scenario (REF) and a mitigation policy scenario (HET28) to simulate a rigid implementation of mitigation targets for the EU agricultural sector.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> The simulation year for both scenarios is 2030, and in both scenarios, farmers can voluntarily apply the above-mentioned technological GHG mitigation options. The REF scenario assumes the status quo policy as scheduled in the current legislation based on the information available by mid-2015 (e.g. abolishing the milk and sugar quotas). The REF scenario relies on the agricultural market outlook of the European Commission (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2012</xref>) and gives medium-term projections up to the year 2022 in a consistent analysis framework by using also external sources for the assumptions on macroeconomic developments (like GDP growth, exchange rates, world oil prices and population growth). As the projection year for our analysis is 2030, we extrapolated and supplemented the European Commissionâ€™s projections with other information to arrive at the CAPRI REF results for the year 2030 (for more information on the CAPRI baseline process, see Himics et al.
