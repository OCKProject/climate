<p id="Par41" class="p">With respect to GHG emission mitigation obligations, the EU agricultural sector is included under the Effort Sharing Decision (ESD) within the ‘2020 Climate and Energy Package’ of the EU (European Council 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2009</xref>). In this ESD, the EU member states have non-uniform GHG emission mitigation targets based on the relative gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. However, the mitigation targets are specific to the member states, but not individual sectors, and up to now, no explicit policy measures have been implemented to force GHG emission abatement in the agriculture sector. Therefore, no mitigation targets are applied in the REF scenario.
