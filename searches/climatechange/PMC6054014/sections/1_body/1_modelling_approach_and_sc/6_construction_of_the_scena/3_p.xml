<p id="Par42" class="p">The mitigation policy scenario (HET28) follows the general setting of the REF scenario but aims at an EU-wide reduction in agricultural non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions of 28% in the year 2030 compared to 2005. The 28% reduction target is in line with the European Commission’s roadmap for moving to a low-carbon economy in 2050 and an accompanying impact assessment (European Commission

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">b</xref>). It has to be noted that in the new ‘2030 Climate and Energy Framework’ of the EU, submitted as INDC to the UNFCCC, agriculture emissions are again covered in an ESD, but targets for the member states for 2030 are still under discussion (European Council 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014</xref>). For our HET28 scenario, we, therefore, use mitigation targets for 2030 that are based on national targets of the current EU ESD (European Council 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2009</xref>). The current ESD aims at a total EU GHG reduction of 20% by 2020 compared to 2005 emission levels. However, the ESD covers several sectors and applying the specific member states targets just to agriculture would translate to a total reduction in EU agriculture emissions by only 9%. Therefore, we increase the member states mitigation targets according to a linear modification (ESD −19%), such that a 28% reduction in agricultural non-CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions is achieved at the aggregated EU level (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The corresponding emission reduction obligations are set per EU member state and NUTS2 region. The CAPRI model structure and the implementation of the mitigation scenario are depicted in Fig.
