<p id="Par11" class="p">Emission reductions in the EU may be linked to production decreases that can trigger increases in imports or decreases in exports. This can induce production increases in non-EU countries, leading to higher emissions in these regions (i.e. emission leakage). To estimate emission impacts outside the EU, a specific CAPRI module has been further developed to estimate emission factors for agricultural products for non-EU countries. The module applies fixed emission coefficient to agricultural production outside of the EU, as computed by the market model. The emission coefficients were estimated using time series data on agricultural production from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and emission inventories from the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>). A robust estimator was developed within a Bayesian framework, using prior distributions for coefficients obtained from the bottom-up computation of emissions in the CAPRI supply model. Once estimated, the coefficients were fixed in simulations, thus permitting no endogenous response in emission intensity in a simulation. As for the calculation of EU agricultural emissions in this paper, we also consider only emissions of the UNFCCC category ‘Agriculture’ for the approach to quantifying emission leakage, that is, other emissions related to agricultural production, like, for example, emissions from land use change, are not covered (for a detailed description of the CAPRI emission leakage methodology see Jansson et al.
