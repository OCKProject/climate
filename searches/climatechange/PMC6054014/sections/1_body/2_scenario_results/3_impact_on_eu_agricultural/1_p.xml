 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> presents how agricultural activities in the EU are affected in scenario HET28 compared to REF. Most of the adjustments to the GHG mitigation obligation are made through lower activity levels (i.e. decreases in animal numbers, hectares and related supply), with largest reductions projected for the livestock sector, particularly beef meat production. Decreases in area and animal numbers are generally bigger than the decreases in supply, indicating productivity increases per animal and area (least productive areas and livestock are likely to be taken out of production first). Except set aside and fallow land, which is projected to increase by more than 17%, the agricultural area is decreasing for all crops, leading to a total decrease in utilized agricultural area of 12%. In the arable sector, fodder activities decrease the most, which is directly related to the decreases in the livestock sector, in particular to the reduction in the ruminant [namely beef cattle (

 <italic class="italic">Ovis aries</italic>) and goats (
 <italic class="italic">Capra hircus</italic>)] fattening activities. On the aggregated EU level, the number of beef cattle decreases by almost 54%, and the impacts are most pronounced in those member states that are confronted with the highest mitigation obligations, such as Denmark (82% reduction in beef herd size) and the Netherlands (76%). The impact on dairy cows (
 <italic class="italic">Bos taurus</italic>) and production is less pronounced than on beef cattle and sheep and goat related activities, which can be attributed to a higher profitability of dairy cow production. Furthermore, the impact on pig (
 <italic class="italic">Sus domesticus</italic>) and poultry [namely chicken (
 <italic class="italic">Gallus gallus</italic>), turkey (
 <italic class="italic">Meleagris gallopavo</italic>), duck (
 <italic class="italic">Anas platyrhynchos</italic>) and goose (
 <italic class="italic">Anser anser domesticus</italic>)] fattening is also lower than on ruminant meet production, which is due to their lower emission intensities (i.e. lower GHG emissions per kilogramme meat).
