<p id="Par46" class="p">The general production decrease results in higher producer and consumer prices in the EU in the scenario HET28 compared to REF (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The rise in producer prices is in line with the projected production decreases, showing highest price increases for beef meat (+64%) and cow milk (66%), and increases of about 11% for producer prices of cereals and oilseeds. Consumer price changes are of the same magnitude when looking at absolute changes, but due to high consumer margins (assumed constant), the relative changes are much lower. The relative increases in consumer prices for meat and dairy products vary between 10 and 30%, whereas the impact on consumer prices for crops is below 1%.
