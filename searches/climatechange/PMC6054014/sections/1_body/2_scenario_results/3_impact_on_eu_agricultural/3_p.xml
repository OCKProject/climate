<p id="Par47" class="p">The production and price developments affect agricultural income. Total agricultural income takes into account the changes in the product margins (gross value added less cost) and in the production quantity of all agricultural activities. The scenario results indicate that in about 95% of the EU regions the increase in producer prices more than offset the income losses provoked by production decreases and increases in production costs. As a consequence, total agricultural income in the EU is projected to increase. However, the aggregated EU result hides large differences between the regions in the member states. Moreover, it has to be kept in mind that the CAPRI model applied is a market model, not a farm model, and therefore cannot depict structural change regarding the number of farmers. Given the large decreases in hectares and herd sizes, it is likely that some (especially smaller and less competitive) farmers would have to leave the sector if they are not able to cope with the rigid mitigation obligation implemented in the scenario. Evidently, only farmers remaining in the sector would benefit from potential income increases.</p>
