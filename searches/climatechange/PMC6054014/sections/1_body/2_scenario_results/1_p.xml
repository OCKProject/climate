 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> presents the decomposition of the EU agriculture GHG emission developments under the REF and HET28 scenarios. The REF scenario shows agriculture’s GHG emissions with no specific emission reduction requirements in place, indicating that by 2030 agriculture emissions in the EU are almost equal to the levels of 2005 (+0.2%). This is especially notable when considering that between 1990 and 2012 the sector experienced a rather steady downward trend of −24% (compared to −19% for total EU emissions, excluding LULUCF). This historical decrease is mainly attributable to reductions in livestock numbers and productivity increases, as well as the implementation of agricultural and environmental policies (Van Doorslaer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2015</xref>). The REF scenario projection suggests that agriculture emissions would plateau in 2030, which is a result of the general policy and technology developments and a favourable agricultural market environment. However, results are quite diverse among the member states. Agriculture emissions decrease most in Greece (−12%), Romania (−11%), Italy and Hungary (−5% each), whereas eight member states show increasing emissions, with highest increases indicated for Bulgaria and Latvia (both about +20%) and Portugal (+16%).
