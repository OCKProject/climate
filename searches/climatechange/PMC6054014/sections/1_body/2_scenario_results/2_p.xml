<p id="Par44" class="p">The emission reductions at member state level in the HET28 scenario should be seen in the context of the emissions in the REF scenario and the emission reduction obligation a member state faces according to the modelled policy (as indicated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>).
