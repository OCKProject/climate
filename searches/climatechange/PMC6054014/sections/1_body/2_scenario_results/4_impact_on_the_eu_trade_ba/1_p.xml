<p id="Par48" class="p">The changes in EU production and prices lead to changes in the EU trade balance (exports–imports) as presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. Regarding the EU’s trade balance, it has to be noted that the scenarios are run under the assumption that current trade agreements and EU border protection mechanisms would stay in place by 2030. Following the large production drops in the EU, almost all agricultural EU exports decrease while at the same time imports increase, leading to a worsening of the EU trade balance of almost all agricultural products. As an exception, net imports are declining for oil cakes [the solids remaining after pressing oilseeds, namely soybean (
 <italic class="italic">Glycine max</italic>), rapeseed (
 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic>) and sunflower seed (
 <italic class="italic">Helianthus annuus</italic>)], which is due to lower feed demand from the EU livestock sector. In line with the production developments, changes in EU imports and exports are more pronounced in the livestock than in the crop sector. EU beef meat imports are projected to increase by about 2 million tonnes (almost 360%). EU exports of pork (−73%) and poultry meat (−44%) decrease significantly, whereas the respective imports increase (although imports involve relatively small quantities). Moreover, the EU trade balance for dairy products weakens considerably, as especially the EU exports are significantly lower (−31%) compared to the REF scenario.
