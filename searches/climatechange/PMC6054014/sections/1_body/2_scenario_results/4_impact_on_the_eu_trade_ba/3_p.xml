<p id="Par50" class="p">The changes in the EU trade balance in the HET28 scenario trigger production increases outside the EU, which in turn leads to an increase in agriculture emissions in non-EU countries and hence emission leakage. The effects of the HET28 scenario on global GHG emissions reveal that emission leakage may considerably downsize the net effect of EU mitigation targets on global GHG reduction. Given the model assumptions, the share of EU mitigated emissions offset by emission leakage may be as high as 91%. The major part of emission leakage is caused by EU imports of animal products, with beef and other animal products being responsible for more than 90% of additional emissions outside the EU. According to CAPRI projections, the major part of emission increases outside the EU may happen in Africa, Asia and South America. This is because the EU grants free market access to developing countries in Africa and Asia and because the EU has established trade relations with South America.</p>
