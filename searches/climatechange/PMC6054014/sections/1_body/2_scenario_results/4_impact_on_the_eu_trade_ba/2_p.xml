<p id="Par49" class="p">As the increases in imports and the decreases in exports at least partly compensate for the reductions in EU production, the final impact of the GHG mitigation obligation on EU consumption appears to be of relatively lower magnitude (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). The biggest consumption decrease is projected for dairy products (almost −3%), varying between −2.5% for fresh milk products and −7.5% for butter (not shown in the figure). Pork meat consumption is expected to decrease by more than 2%, and beef meat as well as sheep and goat meat consumption by about 1%. By contrast, consumers switch to poultry meat, which is less expensive and shows a consumption increase of more than 3%. As a result, total EU meat consumption decreases by only 0.4%. The decreases in the consumption of meat and dairy products seem to be compensated by increases in the food use of cereals (+1.8%), and consumption increases of vegetable oils (+1.8%), and fruits and vegetables (+0.8%).
