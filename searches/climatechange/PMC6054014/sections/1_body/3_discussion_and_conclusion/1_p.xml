<p id="Par51" class="p">The Paris Agreement on Climate Change puts the agricultural sector back into focus when it comes to the fine-tuning of how countries achieve their overall GHG emission reduction targets and the way agriculture will be included in national mitigation strategies. We take the EU as a case study and employ a revised version of the CAPRI model to run a reference scenario and an illustrative policy scenario for emission mitigation in agriculture. For the policy scenario, we simulate a rigid implementation of non-uniform mitigation targets for EU agriculture according to a distribution key that is based on augmented current (European Council
