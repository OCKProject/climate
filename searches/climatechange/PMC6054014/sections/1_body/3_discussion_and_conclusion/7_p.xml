 <italic class="italic">Challenge 4: Tackling GHG emissions from the consumption side.</italic> Our simulation scenario focuses on agricultural emission reduction from the production side. Scenario results show that the mitigation target set within the EU and related production decreases would affect EU consumers via higher food prices, resulting mainly in a decrease in dairy consumption and a rather slight shift in meat consumption towards poultry meat. However, the consumer price effect is rather low, and human consumption is eventually not significantly affected as the decreased production in the EU is partially compensated for by agricultural and food imports, which in turn jeopardize the mitigation efforts in the EU due to emission leakage. This underlines that it might be necessary to take net imported emissions into account when setting national mitigation targets, which would generally introduce new opportunities for emission reduction strategies on a large scale (Chicco and Stephenson

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, emission reduction targets under the UNFCCC are territory and producer-based, and it is rather unlikely that this approach will be changed shortly (Somanathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2014</xref>). Successfully addressing challenges 1 to 3 would decrease the need for major adjustments regarding consumption patterns. Nevertheless, our scenario results give a strong indication that an effective mitigation strategy to decrease GHG emissions from agriculture should also consider options that tackle the reduction from the consumption side, especially with regard to meat products. GHG emission levels are indeed significantly affected by diets, as protein sources from animals are generally related to higher emissions than vegetable protein sources (Davis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2010</xref>), and the importance of a change in consumption patterns to meet stringent climate change targets is also emphasized in the literature (Stehfest et al.
