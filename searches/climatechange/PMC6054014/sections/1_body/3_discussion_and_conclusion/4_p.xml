 <italic class="italic">Challenge 1: Targeted but flexible implementation of mitigation obligations.</italic> Scenario results indicate that it would not be a good strategy if current national mitigation targets were taken as a benchmark to achieve a sectoral EU-wide reduction in agricultural emissions, as this could lead to adverse impacts on agricultural production in most member states and the EU a whole. Our modelling results can be interpreted as high-end estimates of the impacts of the modelled mitigation target for EU agriculture, as farmers are obliged to reduce emissions at the national and regional level, and no grade of flexibility is given regarding the mitigation targets per region. The scenario results suggest that a specific mitigation target for EU agricultural emissions might require a more flexible implementation, also taking into account where emissions are least costly to reduce. Such an approach would not lead to emission reductions according to national mitigation targets nor would it necessarily mean that most emissions would be reduced in those member states with highest absolute agriculture emissions. However, it could help to decrease adverse production effects at aggregated EU level while meeting a specific reduction target for EU agriculture emissions. In general, there is a wide heterogeneity in both mitigation potential and marginal abatement costs within the agricultural sector, not only in the EU but globally, differing between regions and emission sources, and often related to differences in production types and farm size (Vermont and De Cara

A more flexible implementation of mitigation efforts, using market-based approaches, for example, allowing the trade of mitigation obligations among farmers and regions, are considered to diminish adverse effects on production levels (De Cara and Jayet
