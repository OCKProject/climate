 <italic class="italic">Challenge 3: Reducing emission leakage.</italic> Even though the EU meets its emission reduction target in our policy scenario, an estimate on emission impacts outside the EU shows that the projected EU production decreases go along with emission leakage (i.e. an increase of emissions in non-EU countries), which substantially decreases the global net effect of the EU emissions reduction. The rise in non-EU emissions is due to agricultural production increases triggered to compensate for increasing EU imports and decreasing EU exports. The extent of emission leakage and hence the net gain of national mitigation efforts for global GHG emission reduction depends significantly on the relative GHG efficiency (i.e. emissions per unit of output) of agriculture in the exporting countries compared to the importing country (Caro et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2015</xref>). Theoretically, border adjustment measures, like tariffs on imports based on the amount of GHG emissions released in their production, could be a possibility to decrease emission leakage. However, the practical usefulness of such measures is often questioned with respect to their general appropriateness, compliance with rules of the World Trade Organization, and due to concerns about negative welfare effects especially for developing countries (Frankel

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2014</xref>). In any case, such measures might not be necessary if challenges 1 and 2 were successfully tackled, as this would decrease production displacement and hence emission leakage. Moreover, the extent of emission leakage apparently also depends on the commitments other countries make regarding their contributions to the Paris Agreement. It remains to be seen how the global climate agreement will be put into action, but so far, none of the (other) major agricultural trade and important non-CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our scenario results show that such (multilateral) commitments would not only be necessary in the light of emission leakage and global emission mitigation but also with respect to minimizing distortions to agricultural competitiveness arising from unilateral emission mitigation obligations.
