<p id="Par52" class="p">Results of the hypothetical policy scenario show important impacts on EU agricultural production, especially in the livestock sector. Compared to the reference scenario, results of the policy scenario show decreases in the EU cattle numbers of 54%, and in crop and grassland area of up to 12% of the total utilized agricultural area. Crop production is directly affected by the GHG emission reduction obligations and indirectly by the reduced demand for feed from the livestock sector. The decreases in production levels lead to increases in EU agricultural producer prices that are projected to compensate for losses provoked by production decreases and increases in production costs, leading to an increase in total agricultural income at EU level. However, income changes show large regional differences and also some negative income impacts at regional level. Moreover, the model used is a market model and therefore does not account for structural change regarding the number of farms. It is likely that in the policy scenario some (especially smaller and less competitive) farmers would have to leave the sector if they are not able to cope with the GHG mitigation obligations; apparently, only farmers remaining in the sector would benefit from potential increases in total agricultural income. The drop in EU production causes substantially decreasing EU exports and increasing imports, which on the one hand leads to a deterioration of the EU trade balance, but on the other hand, almost compensates for the EU production decreases. Therefore, EU consumption of agricultural products is only moderately affected; for example, total EU meat consumption decreases by only 0.4%, with a slight shift from beef and pork meat consumption to the cheaper and less emission-intensive poultry meat. However, the changes in the EU trade balance induce increases in production and associated emissions in non-EU countries (emission leakage), which considerably downsizes the net effect of the EU mitigation effort.</p>
