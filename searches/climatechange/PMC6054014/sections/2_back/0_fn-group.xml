  <p id="Par4" class="p">According to the Common Reporting Format of the UNFCCC, the source category ‘agriculture’ covers the emissions of nitrous oxide and methane. Emissions (and removals) of carbon dioxide (CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub>) from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) as well as CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions related to energy consumption at farm level (e.g. in buildings and machinery use) or to the processing of inputs (e.g. mineral fertilizers) are attributed to other sectors. In this paper, we focus only on the non-CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions from agriculture.
