   <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> at ‘regional’ administrative level (NUTS3) in Europe, based on confirmed, unpublished and published data made available by national entomologists participating in VectorNet. Please note that the vector presence is likely to be under-reported as reporting is not mandatory. Key: RED: 
   <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> populations are established and there is evidence of reproducing and overwintering mosquitoes in at least one location in the administrative region. YELLOW: 
   <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes have been introduced but are not reported to be established over the past 5 years in the administrative region. DARK GREEN: 
   <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes have not been reported to be introduced or established in the past 5 years despite field surveys and other entomological investigations. MEDIUM GREY: Lack of data over the past 5 years that are available to national entomologists. LIGHT GREY: No field entomological filed investigations over the past 5 years. Source:
