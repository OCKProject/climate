<p class="p">Climate change, meanwhile, most predominantly affects seasonal range expansions and contractions of vector-borne diseases in Europe (Semenza and Menne

 <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>), which means that upsurges in temperature can reduce the incubation period of these pathogens and the life cycle of vectors, thus boosting transmission risk through elevated vector populations, though within a certain temperature envelope. Long-term changes in the seasons can also affect vector and host animals, human activity and land use, which consequently could further affect the spatial-temporal distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases in Europe (Lindgren
