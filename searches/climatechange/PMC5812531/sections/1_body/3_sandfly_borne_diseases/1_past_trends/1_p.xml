<p class="p">In Europe, leishmaniasis is the most prevalent disease transmitted by 
 <italic class="italic">phlebotomine</italic> sandflies, which is caused by two parasites: 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania infantum</italic>, responsible for visceral leishmaniasis, and 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania tropica</italic>, responsible for cutaneous leishmaniasis. In the Mediterranean area, 
 <italic class="italic">L. infantum</italic> is endemic, while 
 <italic class="italic">L. tropica</italic> arises periodically in Greece and neighbouring countries. The transmission of these two parasites is highly influenced by temperature.
