<p class="p">The altitudinal and latitudinal limits of 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> seem to be constrained by cold temperature (Ostfeld and Brunner 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), and a range expansion of ticks to higher altitudes and latitudes is projected. Under climate-change scenarios, warmer winter temperatures, longer growing seasons and earlier summers with elevated temperatures are projected to occur, which could also result in a shift in the distribution of deer host populations (Jaenson and Lindgren 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>).
