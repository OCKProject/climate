<p class="p">By 2040–2060, a 3.8% overall habitat enlargement for 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> is anticipated in Europe under one climate projection, with extension into higher altitudes and latitudes in some areas, especially in Scandinavian and Baltic countries. In contrast, a contraction is foreseen in the Alps, Pyrenees, north-western Poland and the interior of Italy (Boeckmann and Joyner 
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). This observation is consistent with other projections of climate change that predict an expansion of the 
 <italic class="italic">I. ricinus</italic> range (Estrada-Peña, Ayllón and de la Fuente
