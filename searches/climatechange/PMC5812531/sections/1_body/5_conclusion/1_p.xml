<p class="p">Climate change is projected to lead to a further shift of specific tick species to higher latitudes and altitudes and to continue to play a role in the expansion of geographical distribution of the

 <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, monitoring environmental and climatic precursors of vector-borne diseases can help to anticipate a potential upsurge of cases. For example, July temperatures anomalies can be considered a precursor for WNV transmission later on in the season. Forecasts and predictions can be developed by linking the monitoring of these environmental/climatic precursors to dedicated disease surveillance systems with integrated vector surveillance (Semenza
