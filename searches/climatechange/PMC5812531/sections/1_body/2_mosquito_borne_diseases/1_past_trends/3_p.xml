 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). Warm seasonal and annual temperatures and ample rainfall in Europe offer conducive climatic conditions for

The introduction and geographical expansion of the vector has coincided with favourable climatic conditions in France, the Balkans, the eastern coasts of Spain and the Adriatic Sea, and the Benelux countries and western Germany (Caminade
