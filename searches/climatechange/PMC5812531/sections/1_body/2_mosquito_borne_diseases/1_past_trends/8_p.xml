<p class="p">West Nile Virus (WNV) infections are transmitted through 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> sp. mosquito. Infections can be rather serious, mainly among the elderly, although over 60% of infections remain asymptomatic. Infections can also be acquired through contaminated substances of human origin (donated blood, transplants, etc.) and, while infrequent, such instances have been described (Petersen, Brault and Nasci
