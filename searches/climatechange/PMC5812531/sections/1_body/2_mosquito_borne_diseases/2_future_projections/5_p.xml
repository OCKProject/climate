<p class="p">Temperature anomalies due to climate change might influence WNV transmission in Europe by altering the geographic range of vectors, the aerial migration routes of avian WNV hosts and the pathogen life cycle. With July temperature projections for Europe under climate-change models for a medium emissions scenario (the A1B scenario of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios describes a world of rapid economic growth, a global population peaking by mid-21st Century and the rapid introduction of new and more efficient energy technologies (IPCC 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>)), the WNV risk was projected to 2025 and 2050, keeping other variables constant (e.g. bird migratory routes, water index and state of vegetation; Semenza
