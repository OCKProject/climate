<p class="p">Importation risk due to air travel and local transmission is increasing in European areas where the seasonal abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> matches the seasonality of chikungunya epidemics in countries outside of Europe, regardless if perpetuated by 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic> (Charrel, de Lamballerie and Raoult 
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Thus, with the rapid expansion of chikungunya worldwide, the risk for Europe may have increased. For example, models have generally projected that a moderate climatic suitability for chikungunya transmission is anticipated, notably across France, Spain, Germany and Italy (Nsoesie

 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). There are some regional variations, however, with increased suitability projected for large areas by the Rhine and Rhone rivers, while some areas by the Adriatic coast in Italy are projected to experience a decline in suitability due to the increased probability of summer droughts (Tjaden 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="bib70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). The latter finding also corresponds with previous work that has suggested that the risk of Chikungunya will diminish in the Mediterranean region despite remaining climatically suitable for chikungunya transmission (Fig.
