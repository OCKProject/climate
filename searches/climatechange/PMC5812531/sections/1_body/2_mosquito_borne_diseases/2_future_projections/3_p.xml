<p class="p">The risk for dengue in Europe could increase due to climate-related proliferation in the density or seasonal activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. albopictus</italic>. The risk could also potentially increase if variations in temperatures enable the re-establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>, but further modelling studies for continental Europe are needed to determine whether climate change would decrease or increase the climatic suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>.
