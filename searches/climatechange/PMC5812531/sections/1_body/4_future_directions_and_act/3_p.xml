<p class="p">Just as VectorNet collections information relevant for both animal and human health, progress in the field more generally requires greater collaboration between ecologists, virologists, microbiologists, entomologists and stakeholders from the food, animal and human health sectors. In addition, a fully integrated perspective on climate change and vector-borne disease must also develop a more holistic understanding of risk by accounting for vulnerabilities (Suk

A truly integrated understanding would also account for human vulnerabilities. For example, during the 2011 outbreak of Malaria in Greece, migrant agricultural workers played a role in introducing the disease and were also among the most vulnerable to infection, due to limited access to healthcare, poor living conditions close to mosquito breeding sites and suboptimal malaria awareness (Evlampidou
