<p class="p">One recent study identified the climate sensitivity of significant human and domestic animal pathogens in Europe, noting that 63% were climate sensitive (McIntyre

Despite these strong associations, there remain important gaps in studies that attempt to project the impact of climate change on future vector-borne disease transmission. As many other reviews have noted, main gaps include better parameterising the relationships between climatic variables and the key biological processes related to vector-borne disease transmission (e.g. Altizer

Downscaled climate-impact models focused on the European continent could, meanwhile, provide higher resolution on areas with projected changes in risk profiles. In addition, more detailed knowledge of the relationships between climatic drivers and vector-borne disease transmission could facilitate the development and deployment of early warning systems that integrate climatic and epidemiologic data (Lindgren
