<p class="p">The growing body of knowledge on local indigenous knowledge about climate change impacts on biophysical systems provides novel contributions towards our understanding of local climate change and people's responses [

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] in rural communities who are determined to develop sustainable environments [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Murphy et al. [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] contend that successful adaptation to climate change requires understanding processes of social and biophysical change and their interactions within socioecological systems. Thus, LEK can be used to understand community adaptive practices which promote resilience to environmental changes [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] that have negative effects on local livelihoods and sustainable development [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. LEK can therefore supplement scientific data by providing primary and comprehensive descriptions of the biophysical and socioeconomic components of the biosphere landscapes that are experiencing climate change stresses [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In addition, local community traditional daily practices such as weather forecasting can provide a myriad of benefits including making informed decisions to enhance agricultural food security [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. The objectives of this study were to (i) investigate local community perceptions on trends and causes of climate change, (ii) identify biophysical impacts of climate change at the local level, and (iii) explore the ecosystem-based adaptation strategies towards climate change on the MZBR, Zimbabwe.
