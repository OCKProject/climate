 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This calls for research to explore the role of local culture in identifying and responding to threats imposed by the changing climate. Adger et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] suggest that local communities could interpret and construct climate change trends and local indicators within a cultural setting. The United Nations (UN) recognizes the significant role played by indigenous knowledge, cultures, and traditional practices in promoting sustainable development, equity, and management of the environment [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Adger et al. [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] further argue that since culture is embedded in societal modes of production, consumption, lifestyles, and social organization, it should be recognized in understanding both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Understanding and building upon perceptions, experiences, and IK on climate change can contribute towards strengthening the resilience of poor societies who are characterized by weak infrastructure and economic well-being [
