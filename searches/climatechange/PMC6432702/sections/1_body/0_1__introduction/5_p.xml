 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Nyikahadzoi et al. [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] studied the factors influencing climate change adaptation among small-scale farmers in Hurungwe District, Zimbabwe. Ndebele-Murisa et al. [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] studied the effects of climate change and variability on fisheries-based livelihoods in Kariba, Zimbabwe. However, a few studies have focused on the role of local knowledge in understanding climate change trends, impacts, and adaptive strategies among agroecological-based livelihoods within the MZBR. This study uses two case studies to explore local ecological knowledge (LEK) held by local communities on climate change trends, impacts, and adaptation in the Middle Zambezi Biosphere Reserve (MZBR), Zimbabwe.
