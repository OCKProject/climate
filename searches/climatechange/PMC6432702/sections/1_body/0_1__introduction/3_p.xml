<p class="p">Local ecological knowledge (LEK) refers to knowledge, practices, and beliefs shared among local resource users regarding ecological interaction within ecosystems [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. LEK comprises people's lived experiences and their dialectical interaction with the natural environment [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Thus, local knowledge is a key component of integrated ecosystem and community-based adaptation strategies. The Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD) [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] defines ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) as the use of biodiversity and ecosystem services in an overall adaptation strategy. Reid et al. [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>] defines community-based adaptation as a community-led process, based on communities' priorities, needs, knowledge, and capacities, which should empower people to plan for and cope with the impacts of climate change. EbA includes approaches such as the sustainable management, conservation, and restoration of ecosystems to provide services that help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Approaches to ecosystem-based adaptation take into account the multiple social, economic, and cultural cobenefits for local communities as part of an overall adaptation strategy [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This study investigated LEK inclusive of seasonal ecological knowledge (SEK) on climate trends and responses to climate change impacts in the context of a biosphere reserve.
