<p class="p">The recruitment of plants has been constrained by low rainfall and temperature leading to low productivity [
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Low productivity of primary producers (plants) had severe cascading effects on both domestic and wildlife species along the food chain. Climate change has led to creation of strong tensions between humans and wildlife species due to shortage of resources (especially food and water). Occurrence of habitat patches and invasive species (which are inedible to animals) led to animals exceeding their home-ranges and encroaching human habitats, thereby causing damage to crops and property paving a way to human-wildlife conflict. Climate change has the potential to alter migratory routes (and timings) of species that use both seasonal wetlands (migratory birds) and track seasonal changes in vegetation (herbivores) [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. This increase conflicts between people and large mammals such as elephants, particularly in areas where rainfall is low. Change [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] states that wildlife-farming conflict was potentially exacerbated by climate change, in particular, drought, which encourages wildlife to forage on farmlands.
