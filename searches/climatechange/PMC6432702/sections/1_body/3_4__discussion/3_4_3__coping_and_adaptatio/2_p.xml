<p class="p">This study established that illegal harvesting of wildlife and harvesting and consumption of wild fruits and legumes can alleviate food shortages during drought. Similar findings have been observed by [

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] who noted that off-farm income derived from exploitation of wildlife resources is critical to livelihoods and overall adaptive capacity. In coping with risk due to excessive or low rainfall, drought, and crop failure, some traditional people in Ghana also supplement their food by hunting, fishing, and gathering wild food plants [

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] who reported that small holder farmers in northern Nigeria making use of biodiversity in cultivated crops and wild plants as one of the adaptation strategies. For example, Bruschi et al. [
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] found that some plant species like 
 <italic class="italic">Dioscorea cochleari apiculata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dioscorea dumetorum</italic> have been collected from a Miombo woodland and eaten as a means of averting food shortages during drought periods in a rural community of Muda-Serraçã, central Mozambique. Similarly, in this study, the same species provide alternative food during drought periods. In addition, both studies acknowledge that utilisation of the tubers requires one to be thoroughly acquainted with the skills and techniques for making some of the poisonous wild plants edible. Apart from southern Africa, the edible legumes are widely known as famine foods in East Africa and have also been reported as cultivated in some parts of West Africa [
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Key informants also emphasized that 
 <italic class="italic">Dioscorea cochleari apiculata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D. dumetorum</italic> may be eaten only after they have undergone appropriate preparation. Basically, the preparation procedure for the tubers involve the following: peeling the tuber, cutting it into thin slices, dry and wash several hours in a river, always changing the place, and then boil thoroughly for a prolonged period of time till they are cooked. Failure to do this may cause vomiting and even death as revealed by observations from East Africa [
