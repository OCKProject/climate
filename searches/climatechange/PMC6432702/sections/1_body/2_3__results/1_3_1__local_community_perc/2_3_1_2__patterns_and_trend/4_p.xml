<p class="p">A large proportion (94%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=302) of the household respondents had experienced drought. Respondents showed mixed perceptions on the frequency of occurrence of drought with 61.6% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=197) of the respondents perceiving an increase, 14% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=45) perceiving a decline, and 24.4% (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=78) perceiving that temperatures had remained the same (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=0.01). On the other hand, no significant differences were observed on perceptions on excessive heat and excessive cold (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>=0.07). Key informants and FGD participants mentioned that the area had experienced droughts during the following years: 1981/82; 91/92; 87/88; 2001/02; 2007/8; 2013/14. Approximately half of the household respondents (56%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=178) stated that they had experienced extreme cold winters since 2008. Trends in the occurrence of cold winters were also perceived to be on the increase (48/8%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=156), and the severity was moderate (43.4%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=139). FGD participants also stated that, during the 2012/13 and 2014/2015 rain season, the area had received unusual hailstorms associated with destructive winds. However, findings from the household survey show that floods (3.8%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=12) and tropical cyclones (10%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=32) are not a common event in the area. All the key informants and FGD participants concurred that generally, weather conditions had become drier and rainfall timing was becoming more unpredictable.
