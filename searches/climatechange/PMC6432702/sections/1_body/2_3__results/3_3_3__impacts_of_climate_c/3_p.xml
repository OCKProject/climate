<p class="p">Key informants and FGD participants identify wild fruits and forest products, which they used to sustain livelihoods during periods of drought. Respondents indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Piliostigma thonningii</italic> (Schumach) fruits were being harvested and pounded into powder to cook porridge, whilst 
 <italic class="italic">Diospyros mespiliformis</italic> (mushuma) and 
 <italic class="italic">Parinari Curatellifolia</italic> (muchakata) fruits are used as an alternative food source during drought. In addition, exotic tree species such as raw mangoes have also been harvested prematurely and cooked for consumption during the 1991/92 and 2007/8 drought period. During drought local communities also rely on indigenous shrubs and underground tubers such as air potato (manyanya) and “mupama”, although even these roots only do well when there is good rainfall. 
 <italic class="italic">Dioscorea praehensilis</italic> Benth (mupama) and the air potato 
 <italic class="italic">Dioscorea bulbifera</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">manyanya</italic>) are woody perennial plants, which both belong to the family Dioscoreaceae. The plants produce edible underground organs (tubers). The air potato (mupama) is one of the most widely consumed yam species. Mupama tree is also used during drought periods. For example, respondents mentioned the tree species provided food relief to most vulnerable and poor households during the most severe 1991/2 and 2007/8 drought period. Respondents stated that the yam plant produces potato like roots are edible. Unlike the ordinary potato and sweet potato tubers, the air potato tubers have to be thoroughly boiled to remove the bitter taste before consumption. Other key informants reported that if the tubers are underprepared, their consumption could lead to severe stomach ailments and eventually death.
