<p class="p">A large proportion of household respondents (78%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=250) cited declining rainfall (53%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=168) as the major factor contributing to water shortages whilst another proportion (43%; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=136) also indicated that disappearance of wetlands (68; 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>=218) was also mentioned to be succumbing to decreasing rainfall. Field observations revealed that some farmers cultivated in wetlands and valley bottoms, taking advantage of residual moisture in the soils. Personal field observations revealed boreholes, rivers, streams, and wells as the key water sources in the area. Key informants indicated that there have been substantial changes to the flow regime of streams such as Chitake, Chewore, Kabidza, Chitake, Mvurameshi, Mvuramachena, Samhofu, and Hodobe. For instance, key informants reported that Rukomechi river flow regime had changed from perennial to seasonal since 2015/2016 season. The study villages used to have several water sources, which would supply water throughout the year such as natural springs and wetlands, but most of them have dried up.
