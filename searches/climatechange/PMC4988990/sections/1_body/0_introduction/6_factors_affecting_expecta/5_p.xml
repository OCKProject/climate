<p class="p">So far, we have followed the traditional thinking that belief in anthropogenic climate change (and its corollary for practical implication, changing people’s belief in anthropogenic climate change) will be a panacea for changing the public expectations related to a corporation’s responsibility for dealing with climate change. But will this be enough? We propose that as well as beliefs about climate change, when we consider the social contract with corporations we also need to consider beliefs about the perceived broader role of organizations in society; in other words, we suggest that free market ideology is necessary to consider.</p>
