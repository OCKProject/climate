 </bold>, on the whole, the community members in our sample believed that companies were to be held responsible for climate change (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 5.41 on a seven-point scale). Only 26% of participants rated corporate environmental responsibility below the mid-way point on the scale. When comparing perceived corporateâ€™s responsibility to deal with climate change to other loci of responsibility we found that people thought that companies were more responsible for dealing with climate change than the international community (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.21, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), the State Government (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 5.64, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), individuals and families (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 17.61, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), local authorities (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 11.17, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and environmental groups (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 12.97, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) but there was no difference in perceived responsibility when compared with Federal Government (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = -0.34, 
 <italic class="italic">df</italic> = 1063, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.74). Thus, the Australian community believes that companies (together with National Governments) should address climate change.
