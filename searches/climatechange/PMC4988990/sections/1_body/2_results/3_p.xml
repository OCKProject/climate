<p class="p">We assessed Hypothesis 2 using Model 4 in 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayes</xref>â€™ (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) PROCESS Macro. Overall, there was support for our hypothesis. Belief in anthropogenic climate change was significantly related to the mediator, corporate responsibility to deal with climate change (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.002, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and the mediator was significantly related to company regulatory policy (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.26, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.02, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001) after controlling for gender and age. The hypothesized indirect effect of belief in anthropogenic climate change on regulatory policy via perceived corporate responsibility was significant at 0.008 (
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 0.001, 95% CI [0.006, 0.009]). However, there was also a significant direct effect (0.006, 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.004, 0.008]) indicating partial mediation. In total, the model accounted for 32.6% of the variance in regulatory policy, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(4,1043) = 126.26, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001. We tested the robustness of the model by also including education and political orientation as control variables but these were not significantly related to support for regulatory policy when gender and age were included and did not affect the hypothesized relationships.
