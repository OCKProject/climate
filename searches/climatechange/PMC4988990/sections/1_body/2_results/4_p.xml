<p class="p">To assess whether free market ideology affected this mediated relationship, we conducted a moderated mediated analysis using Model 8 of the PROCESS Macro (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayes, 2012</xref>), using centered variables and controlling for age and gender. The results shown in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </bold> indicate that although the perceived amount of human contribution was significantly related to perceived corporate responsibility to deal with climate change (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.03, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.002, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.02, 0.03]), this was moderated by free market ideology (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.01, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.002, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.003, 0.012]; 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>). Moreover, free market ideology had a strong direct effect on corporate responsibility to deal with climate change over and above the interaction (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = -0.53, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.07, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.68, -0.38]). This moderation was also shown to affect support for ‘policy regulating companies’ carbon emissions indirectly via corporate responsibility to deal with climate change (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.24, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.02, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [0.21, 0.27]), however, there was no direct effect of the moderation on support for company regulatory policy (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.86, 95% CI [-0.002, 0.003]). Instead, there was a further strong negative relationship between free market ideology and support for regulatory policy (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> = -0.27, 
 <italic class="italic">SE(B)</italic> = 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, 95% CI [-0.35, -0.18]). With regard to the conditional indirect effects, although indirect effects at high and low levels of free market ideology were significant and positive, the mediated indirect effect was strongest at high levels of free market ideology (0.008; 95% CI [0.006, 0.01]) and lowest at low levels of free market ideology (0.005, 95% CI [0.004, 0.007]), as expected.
