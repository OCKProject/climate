<p class="p">Simple slopes analysis showed that although the positive relationship between anthropogenic climate change and perceived responsibility for companies to deal with climate change was significant at both high (one standard deviation above the mean) and low (one standard deviation below the mean) levels of free market ideology, it was much stronger when free market ideology was high (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 4.09, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001; 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 2.22, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05; respectively). This is in line with our hypothesis that when free market ideology is strong, the mediated relationships should be stronger (because a weak belief in anthropogenic climate change will produce very low perceptions of corporate responsibility to deal with climate change and support for legal regulation) than when free market ideology is weak (because a weak belief in anthropogenic climate change wonâ€™t be as detrimental to belief in corporate responsibility to deal with climate change). An alternative way to interpret this interaction is to examine the simple slopes between free market ideology and perceived corporate responsibility to deal with climate change at different levels of anthropogenic climate change. This is statistically identical yet reveals additional understanding of the relationship. In this case, simple slopes analysis revealed that there was a significant negative relationship between free market ideology and corporate responsibility to deal with climate change at one standard deviation below the mean of anthropogenic climate change (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = -3.79, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001), but at the mean and at one standard deviation above the mean there was no significant relationship (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = -1.43, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.15; 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = -0.52, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.60; respectively). To determine the point at which the relationship between free market ideology and perceived corporate responsibility was completely attenuated, we varied the percentage of human contribution to climate change and found that a non-significant relationship occurred at 45%; in other words, those who believed that less than 45% of climate change was due to human causes had a significant relationship between free market ideology and the perception that corporations were responsible for dealing with climate change.
