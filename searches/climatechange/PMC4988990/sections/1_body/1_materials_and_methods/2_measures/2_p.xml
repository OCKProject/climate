<p class="p">Free market ideology was measured using the five-item measure developed by 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heath and Gifford (2006)</xref>. Participants were introduced to the concept of a free-market before the questions. The items are: “The free-market system is likely to promote unsustainable consumption” (R); “The free-market system may be efficient for resource allocation, but it is limited in its capacity to promote social justice” (R); The preservation of the free market system is more important than localized environmental concerns; Free and unregulated markets pose important threats to sustainable development and “An economic system based on free-markets, unrestrained by government interference, automatically works best to meet human needs” and participants responded on a five-point scale from “Strongly Disagree” to “Strongly Agree.” The internal reliability of the scale was adequate (α = 0.67).
