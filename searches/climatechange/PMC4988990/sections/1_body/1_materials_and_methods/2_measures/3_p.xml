<p class="p">We measured the different loci of responsibility to deal with climate change by asking participants, “Whose responsibility is it to address climate change?” for seven different groups: National government, industry/companies, the international community, state governments, individual/families, local authorities, and environmental groups. Corporate environmental responsibility was captured with the item “Industry/companies.” Participants responded on a seven-point scale from “Not at all” to “Completely” for each locus of responsibility.</p>
