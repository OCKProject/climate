<p class="p">For 
 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. haematobium</italic>, in both timeframes forecast, the potential transmission areas could retreat from the Saharan areas as the desert might encroach on this part of the continent due to diminishing or discontinued rainfall. The future transmission areas of 
 <italic class="italic">S. mansoni</italic> might shrink more than those of 
 <italic class="italic">S. haematobium</italic>, while schistosomiasis in Ethiopia and other highlands in Africa could reach higher with warmer temperatures.
