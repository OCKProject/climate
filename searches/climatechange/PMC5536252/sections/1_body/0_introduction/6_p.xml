 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knox et al. (2012)</xref>, using meta-analysis of large number of publications, reported 10% reduction in yield of millet across Africa with climate change by 2050. 
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sultan et al. (2013)</xref> assessed the impacts of climate change on millet and sorghum yields in the Sudanian and Sahelian savannas of West Africa. They created multiple possible climate scenarios (thirty five) by combining precipitation changes from − 20% to 20% and temperature changes from + 0 to + 6 °C. Out of 35 scenarios tested 31 scenarios showed a negative impact on yield, up to − 41% (+ 6 °C/− 20% rainfall). They also concluded that changes in rainfall cannot counter the negative impacts caused by temperature rise when warming exceeds 2 °C. The Sudanian region appears to be more vulnerable as the probability of yield reduction appeared to be greater than in the Sahelian region. Their simulations also showed that the traditional millet and sorghum varieties used by the local farmers which are photoperiod-sensitive were more resilient to future climate conditions than the high yield potential modern cultivars.
