 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fussell et al. (1980)</xref> reported that high temperatures (33/28 °C day/night) during vegetative, stem elongation and grain development phases decrease grain yield by reducing basal tillers, number of grains per inflorescence and single-grain weight. In the arid and semi-arid tropics the mean crop-season temperatures are already in the higher range for pearl millet production. Any further increase in temperature due to climate change will significantly reduce crop yields. However, increased CO
