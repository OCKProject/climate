<p class="p">Low and erratic rainfall, high temperatures, poor soil fertility among the abiotic stresses and downy mildew disease and widespread 
 <italic class="italic">striga</italic> infestation among biotic stresses, are the major constraints to the production of pearl millet. These constraints cause low and highly variable yields both in Asia and Africa. In addition to these constraints, the projected climate changes in the most arid and semiarid tropical regions will adversely impact the crop yields, thus challenging the food security in these regions (
