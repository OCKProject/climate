<p class="p">Changes were made in WR (relative root length density distribution with soil depth) and LL (lower limit of soil water availability) for each soil layer given in the soil file (*.SOL) to enhance drought tolerance of cultivars. The procedure for creating drought tolerant virtual cultivars has been described in detail by

 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al., 2014c</xref>. Heat tolerant pearl millet virtual cultivar was created by increasing the two upper threshold values of each RGFIL (relative grain filling rate with temperature) and RGSET (relative grain set rate with temperature) located in the species file (*.SPE) by 2 °C. In case of RGFIL the upper optimum temperature threshold (TOP2) value was increased from 27 to 29 °C and the damaging (failure) temperature threshold (TMAX) value increased from 60 to 62 °C. In case of RGSET the TOP2 was increased from 33 to 35 °C and the TMAX from 39 to 41 °C (see
