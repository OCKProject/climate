<p class="p">For each baseline cultivar three crop maturity durations were identified for developing virtual cultivars – baseline (no change in the GCs), 10% shorter and 10% longer maturity cultivars. The procedure for making changes in crop maturity duration has been described in 
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al. (2014c)</xref>. To increase the yield potential of cultivars, the coefficients G1, G4 and GT in the cultivar file and radiation use efficiency (RUE) in the ecotype file (*.ECO) were increased by 10% each. These procedures resulted in six virtual cultivars, namely, baseline, 10% short, 10% long, baseline + yield potential, 10% short + yield potential and 10% long + yield potential, to which the drought and heat tolerance traits were incorporated virtually.
