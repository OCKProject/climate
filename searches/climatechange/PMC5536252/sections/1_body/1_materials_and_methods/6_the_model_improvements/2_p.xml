<p class="p">The default version of the CSM-CERES-Pearl millet model had certain deficiencies that limited adequate simulation of the yield response to agronomic management and environmental factors, especially high temperatures. Certain changes in model code and parameters were necessary to improve the model and make it responsive to agronomic and environmental factors. The model underestimated grain yields when the crop was grown at low plant density or quite wide row-spacing. The power coefficient in the equation determining light interception by the canopy (LIFAC) was decreased from 0.1 to 0.04 to improve the model response to plant population/row-spacing. The model also underestimated the yield when drought stressed during reproductive period. To overcome this, the direct water stress effects were taken out from the equations in the model estimating panicle weight (PANWT), thus relying only on drought effects to reduce LAI and crop photosynthesis, and indirectly reducing panicle/grain growth. The model underestimated the leaf area of tillers as compared to the leaf area of main stem, thus minimizing their relative contribution to the overall yield of millet crop. A new genetic coefficient GT (tiller leaf size coefficient) was introduced in the cultivar file and code was added to enhance contribution of tillers to the total leaf area of the plant. Under extended day length the model over estimated grain yield and harvest index compared to the observed data because the extended day-length favored both the total biomass and panicle growth. The reduction in grain yield with delayed sowing was too strong in the model and also not consistent with the reduction in total biomass produced. This led to investigation on how grain numbers were being set in the model and required some changes in the code. The original code had 100% dependency of grain number and initial panicle mass on total biomass at the time of grain-set; the new code was modified to use 50:50 effect of crop growth rate during the ISTAGE4 phase (end of leaf growth to end of panicle growth) as well as total biomass at end of ISTAGE4 (end of panicle growth) when grain number and initial panicle mass were set. A new genetic coefficient G5 (potential grain size) was introduced in the cultivar file to set seed size, which also affected seed numbers set (see 
 <xref rid="s0105" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Appendix I</xref> for the explanation of GCs used in the modified version of the millet model). Some temperature-related response functions such as leaf area expansion (RGLAI) were hard-wired in the original model code; thus for the modified model these were externalized in the species file to allow correctly setting the upper limits of temperature thresholds for these processes. The temperature-related functions for photosynthesis (PRFTC) and grain growth rate (RGFIL), while already in the species file, were modified in their parameterization. Also the original model did not have any provision to affect seed number set by high temperatures (RGSET) and thus the effects of heat tolerance in pearl millet could not be evaluated. A new function (RGSET) was added to simulate high temperature effects on seed-set of pearl millet based on the work of
