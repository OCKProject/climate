<p class="p">Each year simulations were initiated on 1st January when the soil profile was assumed to be at lower limit of water availability (LL). Each year the sowing window was first week of July to end of August for Hisar, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner locations and third week of June to last week of August for the Aurangabad and Bijapur locations. The simulated crop was sown on the day within the sowing window when the soil moisture had reached at least 40% of the extractable water-holding capacity in the top 30-cm soil. For the drier locations (Hisar, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Bikaner) a plant population of 13 plants per m

As the study primarily focused on the climate change impacts, the P-module in the millet model was turned off and did not respond to any P application. The SLPF (soil-limited photosynthesis factor) values for the selected locations were the same as used for model calibration for each site (see 
 <xref rid="s0040" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.6</xref>). For each climate scenario (baseline and climate change) and for evaluating the genetic traits the simulations were carried out for 30 years each for Hisar, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Bikaner and Aurangabad; whereas for Bijapur, Sadore and Cinzana these were done for 25, 26 and 28 years, respectively. As the pearl millet model does not simulate the effects of biotic stresses, the crop was considered free from pests and diseases. All the simulated data were analyzed using GenStat software by following the analysis of variance (ANOVA) method (
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Payne et al., 2009</xref>). To compare the treatments, RBD (Randomised complete block design) was followed and the LSD at 5% level of probability was calculated to compare the treatments. Years were considered as replications (blocks), as the pearl millet yield of a given treatment in one year was not affected by the prior year (no carry-over effect of soil water from one year to another).
