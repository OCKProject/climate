<p class="p">The modified CSM-CERES-Pearl millet simulation model coupled with the seasonal analysis tool available in DSSAT v4.6.1.0 was used to simulate climate change impacts on pearl millet productivity. For each study location, we carried out simulations for both baseline and the projected climate change (Temperature + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + Rainfall) by 2030 and 2050. The atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration used were 380 ppm, 432 ppm and 571 ppm for the baseline, 2030 and 2050 climate projections, respectively (
