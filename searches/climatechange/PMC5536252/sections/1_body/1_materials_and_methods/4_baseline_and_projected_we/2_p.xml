<p class="p">Thirty-years (1980–2009) of observed daily weather data for the Indian locations were obtained from the India Meteorology Department, Pune, India, or downloaded from the NOAA site, except for the Bijapur site where only 25 years (1983–2007) data were available. Weather data for Sadore (1983–2008) and Cinzana (1983–2010) were obtained from the research stations of ICRISAT at Sadore (Niger) and Bamako (Mali), respectively. The baseline weather data of locations were checked for quality and the anomalous values, if found, were corrected using the bias-corrected AgMERRA data (

Future climate projections were created by utilizing “delta” approach, in which mean monthly climate changes from baseline under RCP 8.5 for near and mid-century period were applied to the daily baseline weather as per the mohc_hadgem2_es GCM model. Temperature changes were added to the baseline temperature, whereas precipitation change factors were multiplied to the precipitation data of the locations. The future time scale weather series and the corresponding projected CO
