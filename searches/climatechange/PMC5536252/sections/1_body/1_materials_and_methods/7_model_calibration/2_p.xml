<p class="p">ICMH 356 and Sharda were considered as the most suitable baseline cultivars for Indian locations. Depending upon location and season, ICMH 356 takes 75 to 82 days to reach maturity, whereas Sharda takes 78 to 86 days to maturity. In the All India Coordinated Pearl Millet Improvement Project (AICPMIP) trials, these cultivars were used as national checks in the multi-location trials in India. ICMH 356 was used as a check in the north-western states (Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat) and at some locations in the southern states (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu). Sharda was used as check in the central and southern states (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu) of India. To determine GCs of these baseline cultivars, the Advanced Hybrid Trials data (1995–2012) of AICPMIP were used (

The selected locations for ICMH 356 were Ludhiana, Delhi, Gwalior, Hisar, Bawal, Bikaner, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Anand and Anantapur. For Sharda the selected locations were Anantapur, Palem, Bijapur, Aurangabad, Buldana, Dhule, Mandore and Coimbatore. The available agronomic data included sowing date, harvest date, NPK applications and scheduling of irrigations to the crop. The observed data available from the variety trials were anthesis and maturity dates, seed size, and grain and fodder yields. For the drier locations in the north-western zone (Rajasthan and Haryana, rainfall &lt; 450 mm during the growing season), plant population was 13 plants m
 <sup class="sup">− 2</sup> with a row spacing of 60 cm. Across locations and seasons, nutrient management ranged from 40 to 80 kg N and 20 to 40 kg P ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>. All the P and half the N dose was applied at the time of sowing and the remaining N at 30 days after sowing. For the wetter locations in the north-western and south-central zones (rainfall &gt; 450 mm during the growing season) the plant population was 18 plants m
 <sup class="sup">− 2</sup> with a row spacing of 45 cm. Whenever the total N application in a season exceeded 80 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>, the extra amount was applied at 50 days after sowing. GCs of pearl millet comprise those of phenology (P1, P2O, P2R and P5) and growth coefficients (G1, G4 and GT). These coefficients were determined by several iterations of the model such that the simulated data on phenology and crop yields matched the observed data across locations for a given pearl millet cultivar. Since the phenology of pearl millet is similar to that of sorghum, the iteration process followed to determine its phenology coefficients was the same as for sorghum (
 <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Singh et al., 2014c</xref>). Crop growth coefficients affecting total biomass production and its partitioning to panicle and seeds and crop canopy leaf area expansion were set by adjusting the scales for relative leaf size on main stem (G1), partitioning of assimilates to the panicle (G4) and relative leaf size on tillers (GT). SLPF (soil limited photosynthesis factor as given in the SOIL.SOL file) was also set to match the simulated yields with the observed data recorded across seasons for a site. The SLPF values used were 0.69 for Delhi, 0.95 for Ludhiana, 0.80 for Hisar, 0.91 for Bawal, 0.92 for Anand, 0.70 for Jaipur, 0.70 for Jodhpur, 0.82 for Bikaner, 0.76 for Aurangabad, 0.81 for Bijapur, 0.80 for Buldana, 0.78 for Dhule, 0.84 for Mandore, 0.65 for Anantapur, 0.74 for Palem and 0.77 for Coimbatore. Since the soil and weather data used for simulation did not belong, in a spatially exact sense, to the trial locations and since the records of crop agronomy and observed crop data had certain deficiencies, we calibrated the GCs of cultivars such that the mean, maximum and minimum grain yields simulated by the model were mostly within 15% of the reported mean, maximum and minimum grain yields for the locations. Thus, the rain-fed potential yield and the minimum yield were primarily obtained under drought stress and the mean yield for each site was simulated accurately.
