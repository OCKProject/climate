<p class="p">For the West African locations the baseline cultivar used was CIVT. This cultivar is of medium duration and took about 105 to 112 days to mature at the selected target locations. All the growth, development and yield data used in this study for the CIVT cultivar were generated in field trials conducted at ICRISAT Research Centre at Sadore, Niamey, in Niger. The 1986 and 1987 seasons data (

 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akponikpe, 2008</xref>) were used for model calibration of GCs of the CIVT cultivar. These trials consisted of two to four sowing dates with some supplemental irrigation during the dry periods. Data were collected on 50% flowering, days to maturity, total biomass and grain yield. The model calibration procedure was the same as described above. The 1984, 1985, 1986 and 1987 seasons data (

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Akponikpe et al., 2008</xref>) were used for model evaluation. In these trials the crop was grown rainfed at different levels of N (0 to 60 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) and P (0 to 20 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) application in different years through chemical or organic sources. The crop in all these trials was grown in hills 1 m × 1 m apart and 3 plants per hill to give a plant population of 3 or 3.3 plants per m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. In the experiments where organic sources of nutrients were applied along with mineral fertilizers, the Century (Parton) method was used for the simulation of crop growth and yields; whereas where only mineral fertilizers were applied the CERES (Godwin) method was used. The SLPF values of the soils used for all the simulations were 0.55 each for Sadore and Cinzana, except for the experimental site during the 1995 season at Sadore when SLPF of 0.45 was used.
