<p class="p">We used DSSAT v4.6.10 (Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer, version 4.6.10) (
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoogenboom et al., 2014</xref>) as the starting point; however the existing CSM-CERES-pearl millet model (default version) was modified to assess the impact of climate change and plant traits on the productivity of pearl millet. The improvements made in the millet model are described in 
 <xref rid="s0035" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.5</xref>. This improved version of the model will be part of the next version of DSSAT. The model simulates crop growth and development (vegetative and reproductive) processes and dynamics of water, nitrogen and carbon in the soil. These processes have been described in detail by 
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ritchie et al. (1998)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ritchie (1998)</xref>. 
 <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jones et al. (2003)</xref> describe the minimum soil, weather, management and site data needed as input to the model to simulate a crop. The model also needs crop-specific parameters and cultivar-specific parameters or genetic coefficients (GCs) to simulate growth and yield of a pearl millet cultivar.
