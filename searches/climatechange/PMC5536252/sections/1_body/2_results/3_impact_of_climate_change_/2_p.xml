 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Climate change by 2030 significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the grain yield at Hisar by 34%, mostly because of increased rainfall at that location, but not at Jaipur. Overall effect of climate change factors (temp. + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + rain) by 2050 was 8% increase in yield at Hisar, which was statistically non-significant (p &lt; 0.05). At Jaipur, however, the yield significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased by 7% as compared to the baseline yield. The decrease in yield at Jaipur could be due increased crop water stress on the light textured shallow soil with the increase in temperature in spite of increase in rainfall at this site.
