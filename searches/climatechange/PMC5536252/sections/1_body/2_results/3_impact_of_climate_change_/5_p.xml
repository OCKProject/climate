These changes in yields at both of these locations were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to the baseline yields at the respective locations. Overall effect of climate change factors (temperature + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> + rainfall) by 2050 was significant (p &lt; 0.05) decrease in yield at Sadore (− 14%) and non-significant increase at Cinzana (4%). In spite of some reduction in rainfall during July at Cinzana, the increasing trend in yield at Cinzana could be attributed to overall better moisture regime with climate change at Cinzana than at Sadore.
