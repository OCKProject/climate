<p class="p">Climate change at most sites, except Jodhpur and Bikaner, decreased the standard deviation in yields associated with mean yields under climate change. This may be attributed to increase in rainfall at the sites in future due to climate change. Jodhpur and Bikaner are in more arid climate where climate change increased the standard deviation in yields, which is one of the measures of uncertainty in yields.</p>
