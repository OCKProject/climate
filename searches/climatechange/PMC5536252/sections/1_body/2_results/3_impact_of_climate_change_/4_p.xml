Climate change by 2050 decreased the yield by 14% and 4% at Aurangabad and Bijapur, respectively, which was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) at Aurangabad, but not at Bijapur. The larger decrease in yield at Aurangabad could be attributed to low water holding capacity of soil and the least increase in rainfall after July as compared to Bijapur and other selected locations in India.
