<p class="p">At Hisar the yield increased by 8% with drought tolerance under base climate and 9% under climate change (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Increase in yield due to heat tolerance was only 3% under baseline climate, which significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased up to 8% under climate change. Both drought and heat tolerance combined increased the yield by 11% under baseline climate and 17% under climate change. At Jaipur, drought tolerance increased the yield by 8% and 7% under baseline climate and climate change, respectively, which were significant (p &lt; 0.05) increases (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The benefit in yield due to heat tolerance at Jaipur was only 4% under baseline climate and 6% under climate change, however, the yield increases were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Both drought and heat tolerance combined gave 11% yield increase under baseline climate and 13% in climate change conditions.
