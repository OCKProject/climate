<p class="p">At Jodhpur drought tolerance trait increased the yield by 16% under base climate and 6% under climate change (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Heat tolerance increased the yield by 4% under baseline climate and 8% in climate change conditions. Drought and heat tolerance together gave a yield advantage of 20% and 14% under baseline climate and climate change, respectively. At Bikaner the yield gain due to drought tolerance was 19% under baseline climate and 22% under climate change, which were the highest gains in yields in percentage terms in the respective climates due to drought tolerance among the Indian locations (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). Bikaner was the warmest of the selected locations in India, thus the yield benefit due to heat tolerance in percentage terms was the highest, which was 12% and 17% under baseline climate and climate change, respectively. The combined benefit of drought and heat tolerance was also the highest at this site, which was 34% and 42%, respectively, for the two climates. At Jodhpur and Bikaner locations all the yield gains due to drought or heat tolerance were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) under both the baseline and climate change scenarios.
