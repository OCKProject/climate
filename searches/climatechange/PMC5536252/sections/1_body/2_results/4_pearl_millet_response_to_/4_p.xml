<p class="p">Jodhpur and Bikaner being warmer locations than Hisar and Jaipur, the baseline cultivar ICMH 356 matured a few days earlier than at Hisar and Jaipur and on average it produced 1357 kg ha

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> at Bikaner under baseline climate (
 <xref rid="t0025" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). At Jodhpur the grain yields of 10% shorter or 10% longer maturity cultivars were not significantly (p &lt; 0.05) different from the baseline cultivars yield under baseline climate. Yield potential traits increased the yield of virtual cultivars by 15% to 18% with maximum yield gain for the 10% short duration cultivar. Under climate change, the yield of shorter duration cultivar decreased by 16%; whereas, the yield of longer duration cultivar increased by 6%, which was a non-significant (p &lt; 0.05) increase in yield. Yield potential traits significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the yield of virtual cultivars by 18% to 24% under climate change. At Bikaner, the changes in grain yield due to crop maturity or yield potential traits were non-significant under both climate scenarios, except for the longer duration cultivar with yield potential traits that produced significantly higher yield under baseline climate (
