<p class="p">At Aurangabad the cultivar Sharda took 85 days to mature under baseline climate and on average produced 2241 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> of grain yield; whereas at Bijapur it took 84 days to mature and produced 1795 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> of grain yield (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Reducing crop maturity by 10% decreased crop yield by 42%, whereas increasing crop maturity by 10% increased yield by 47%. Yield potential traits increased yield by 25% to 40% (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). The highest increase in yield due to yield potential traits was with the 10% shorter duration cultivar and the lowest with the 10% longer duration cultivar. Under climate change, the yield of shorter duration cultivar decreased by 42% and that of longer duration increased by 46%. Yield potential traits increased the yield of virtual cultivars by 31% to 43%. As under baseline climate, the yield increase due to yield potential traits was the greatest with the shorter duration and the lowest with the longer duration cultivar. Under both climates, however, the maximum absolute yield was obtained for the longer maturity cultivar along with yield potential traits. At Bijapur, the crop maturity and yield potential traits increased the yield of virtual cultivars in way similar to the Aurangabad site under both the climates; however, the magnitude of absolute yields was different from those simulated for the Aurangabad site (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). At both Aurangabad and Bijapur locations under baseline and climate change scenarios, the changes in crop yields due to crop maturity or yield potential traits were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05). Drought tolerance increased the yields by was 6% and 7% at Aurangabad under baseline climate and climate change, respectively (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Aurangabad being the coolest of all the selected locations, heat tolerance did not enhance the yields under both the climates. For the Bijapur site, the yield gain due to drought tolerance was 15% under baseline climate and 13% under climate change (
 <xref rid="t0030" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>). Like Aurangabad site, heat tolerance at this site had no beneficial effect on pearl millet yields under both the climate scenarios. However, the yield gains due to drought tolerance at Aurangabad and Bijapur were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05) under both baseline climate and climate change.
