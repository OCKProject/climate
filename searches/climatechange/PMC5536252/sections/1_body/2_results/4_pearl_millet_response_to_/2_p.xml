 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>) was simulated for the 10% longer duration cultivar having yield potential traits incorporated. Under climate change, the pattern of yield response to crop maturity duration and yield potential traits was similar to that simulated for the baseline climate. Thus, the longer duration cultivar, with and without yield potential traits, gave the highest yield under both the baseline and climate change scenarios. At Jaipur, the same cultivar matured in 76 days and on average produced 1405 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> grain yield under baseline climate (
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Under both climate scenarios, the percent change in yield due to incorporation of yield potential and crop maturity traits followed the similar trend as for the Hisar site. However, the base + yield potential virtual cultivar had significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher yield compared to the baseline cultivar under both climates.
