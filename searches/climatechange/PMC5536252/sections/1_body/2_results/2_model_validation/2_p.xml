<p class="p">Simulated grain yields of baseline cultivars were significantly correlated with observed data of the three cultivars (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The d-value, an index of model predictability (
 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Willmott, 1982</xref>), was 0.97 for ICMH 356, 0.96 for Sharda and 0.97 for CIVT. These results confirm that the modified model can accurately simulate the growth and yield of pearl millet for the millet-growing regions of India and West Africa.
