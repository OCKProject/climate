<p class="p">At Sadore, cultivar CIVT took 105 days to mature and produced 1188 kg ha

 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup> of grain yield. Higher mean yield at Cinzana could be attributed to higher seasonal rainfall at Cinzana than at Sadore (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). At Sadore under baseline climate, the yield of 10% shorter and 10% longer maturity cultivars decreased by 3% and 15%, respectively. Incorporating yield potential traits increased the yield of virtual cultivars by 11% to 14%. Under climate change, the yield of both shorter and longer maturity cultivars decreased and the decrease was significant (p &lt; 0.05) for the shorter maturity cultivar (17%). Yield potential traits significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased the yield of virtual cultivars, which ranged from 12% to 21% with the greatest increase for the shorter maturity cultivar (
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). At Cinzana, the yield of shorter and longer duration cultivar decreased by 10% and 17%, respectively, under baseline climate. Yield potential traits increased the yield of virtual cultivars up to 10%, which was statistically non-significant (p &lt; 0.05). Under climate change the grain yield of shorter maturity cultivar significantly (p &lt; 0.05) decreased by 29% and that of longer maturity increased by 4%. Yield benefit of yield potential traits ranged from 10% to 21% across virtual cultivars. Under climate change the highest yield was simulated for the 10% longer maturity cultivar with yield potential traits (1582 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>), but did not differ significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from the baseline cultivar with yield potential traits (
