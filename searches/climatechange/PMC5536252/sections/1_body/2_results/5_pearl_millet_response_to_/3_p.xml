<p class="p">At Sadore, drought tolerance increased the yield by 30% under baseline climate and 17% under climate change. Whereas, at the Cinzana, the yield gains due to this trait were 12% under baseline climate and 8% under climate change (
 <xref rid="t0035" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>). Lesser benefit due to drought tolerance under climate change at Cinzana is attributed to better rainfall regime during the season under climate change than at Sadore. Sadore being the warmer site than Cinzana, the yield gain due to heat tolerance was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater at Sadore (5%) than at Cinzana (2%) under baseline climate. However, under climate change the yield benefit due to heat tolerance significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased at both locations (13% at Sadore and 6% at Cinzana). Both drought and heat tolerance combined had additive effects on yield under both baseline and climate change scenarios at the two locations in West Africa.
