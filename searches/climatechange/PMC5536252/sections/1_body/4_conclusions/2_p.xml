<p class="p">This study focused on the major crop productivity constraints associated with climate change in future in the millet growing environments in India and West Africa. The study revealed that under climate change conditions Hisar, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Bikaner, Sadore and Cinzana will need baseline or slightly longer duration cultivars along with drought and heat tolerance traits. However, Aurangabad and Bijapur will benefit from longer duration cultivars with only drought tolerance for higher yields in future climates. Yield potential traits will be useful at all the locations under climate change. As compared to the baseline climate, the relative contribution of drought tolerance traits to grain yield will be somewhat variable under climate change, depending on degree of rainfall change and soil water retention characteristics of locations. However, the relative contribution of heat tolerance to grain yield increased with climate change especially at the warmer locations. To enhance and sustain yields of pearl millet under climate change a different combinations of plant traits will be needed at different target locations. The modified CSM-CERES-Pearl Millet model and the virtual crop modeling approach were useful in evaluating such plant genetic traits.</p>
