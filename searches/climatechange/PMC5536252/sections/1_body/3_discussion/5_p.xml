<p class="p">In addition to drought, high temperatures during the cropping season also adversely affect grain yields in current climate at most locations and will be even more damaging under climate change with increasing temperatures. In current climate, the benefit of incorporating up to 2 °C greater heat tolerance had maximum yield advantage at Bikaner (12%) followed by Sadore, Jodhpur, Jaipur, Hisar and Cinzana. Because of current low temperatures at Aurangabad and Bijapur, heat tolerance trait had no effect on grain yield there. However, under climate change the benefit of incorporating heat tolerance further increased at all the locations, except at Aurangabad and Bijapur. The maximum benefit of heat tolerance in terms of yield increase was 17% at Bikaner, followed by 13% at Sadore, 8% each at Jodhpur and Hisar and 6% each at Jaipur and Cinzana. Heat tolerance exists among pearl millet genotypes and this has been amply demonstrated by 
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gupta et al. (2015)</xref> in field trials conducted during spring-summer season (March to May) in India. Thus heat tolerant germplasm could be used to breed new varieties to enhance heat tolerance in pearl millet under future climate change conditions. Combining drought tolerance with heat tolerance in a virtual cultivar further enhanced the yields and the effects were mostly additive in both current and future climates.
