<p class="p">The simulation study investigated the role of genetic improvement of pearl millet for adapting to climate change in future. Because the climate changes are projected to be small in the near-future, short-term agronomic adjustments (such as changing the sowing date, fertilizer management, water management etc.) may be more readily useful than genetic options for adapting to climate change (

Under more adverse climate change, a combination of both improved agronomic and genetic options will be needed for adapting to climate. For each target site these options would need to be prioritized, in terms of yield or economic advantage, for greater adoption by the farmers under climate change. This study focused on the major plant traits that are believed to be most useful in adapting pearl millet to climate change in the arid and semi-arid tropical environments in India and West Africa. There may be some other site-specific plant traits, such as resistance to insect pests and plant diseases, useful for adapting to climate change that have not been considered here. Additionally, adaptation to extreme weather events beyond drought and heat (such as water-logging and wind) were not considered here. Overall, this study has broad application for adapting pearl millet to climate change.
