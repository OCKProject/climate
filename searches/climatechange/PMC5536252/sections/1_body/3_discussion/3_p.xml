<p class="p">In addition to increase or decrease in crop duration, altering yield potential-controlling genetic traits (RUE, G1, G4 and GT) were also tried as adaptation options across locations in India and Africa. Incorporating yield potential traits in the longer maturity cultivar increased the yield up to 25% at Hisar, 13% at Jaipur, 18% at Jodhpur, 20% at Bikaner, 31% at Aurangabad and 33% at Bijapur under climate change. However, the yield improvements for the baseline and shorter maturity cultivars with yield potential traits were even larger. At Sadore under climate change, the yield of the baseline cultivar was the highest (1018 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">− 1</sup>), which further increased by 14% by incorporating yield potential traits (

Yield gains associated with changing yield potential traits virtually were mainly due to changes in sources and sink size.

 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ong and Monteith (1985)</xref> identified several genotypes in pearl millet having different source and sink sizes. Based on our study it was clearly evident that genotypes having higher RUE (source) and G1, G4 and GT (sink size) will produce higher yields under climate change conditions.
