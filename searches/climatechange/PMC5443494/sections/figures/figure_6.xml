  <title class="title">Temporal trends in monthly precipitations (A) and glacier and snow-covered surfaces (B) over the period (1984â€“2011) in the Cordillera Real, Bolivia.</title>
  <p class="p">Monthly Precipitation data were obtained from the Zongo valley. Glacier and snow-covered surfaces were measured using LANDSAT images during the dry period (between May and August). Panels C and D give the relationships between wetland cover and precipitation (monthly values over three months prior to the satellite image) and glacier and snow-covered surfaces.</p>
