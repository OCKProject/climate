<p class="p">Beyond the specific focus of our study, this work supports the recent view that satellite-based monitoring of ecosystem sentinels can help filling the lack of information on current and changing environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], a common and crucial problem issue in climate change research, particularly in less-developed countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. This opens a promising line of research to better evaluate the conservation status of entire ecosystems, in particular in remote areas. Additional information on the social dynamics associated with these changes are urgently needed as the interaction between the ongoing climate-forced physical changes in land-cover and socio-economic forces affecting land-use has the potential to initiate a destructive positive feedback loop. In the high tropical Andes, grazing, mining, and peat extraction will probably become more intense on the remaining optimal sites as more and more sites become degraded, dooming many of these unique ecosystems and their ability to support livelihoods.
