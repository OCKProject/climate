<p class="p">Despite the correlative nature of our results, wetland cover variations appeared to finely respond to increases in both precipitation extreme events and glacier melting over the 1984â€“2011 period in the Bolivian Cordillera Real. The observed increase in wetland cover is probably momentary in view of the predicted future decrease in both total precipitations [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] in the region for the coming decades. Moreover, the increase in wetland surface area and number was mostly due to the apparition of temporary wet grasslands, while more perennial and complex wetlands experienced strong drying processes resulting from alternating drier and wetter years. This type of wetland is at great risk as the presence of rapidly disappearing glaciers in their catchments buffer against drying. High Andean wetlands can therefore be considered as ecosystem sentinel for climate change as they seem sensitive to changes in both extreme rainfall events and glacier melt water supply.
