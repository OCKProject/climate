<p class="p">Several methodological issues need to be discussed to appreciate potential limitations of our results. For example, the entities outlined in this work, and identified as wetlands, are defined on the basis of a threshold applied on reflectance values of a 900-m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> area (surface area of one pixel of a LANDSAT image). This reflectance value characterizes vegetation intensity on that area. It is worth emphasizing that mixed pixels,

 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. containing both vegetation and bare soil can be missed, as well as entities smaller than 900 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. However, we are confident that our methodology gave a robust estimation of annual changes in the number and surface area of wetlands because 1) all used images have the same spatial resolution, 2) all images were converted from digital number to reflectance values, and 3) the same NDVI threshold was applied to all images. In addition, we already mentioned the relevance of the NDVI to delineate wetlands on LANDSAT images based on the comparison with the high spatial resolution PLEIADES images that allowed a manual delineation of wetlands with a high degree of confidence. Regarding the monitoring of individual wetlands changes, it is worth emphasizing that this monitoring is relative to the initial state of the wetlands,
