<p class="p">Our work revealed an increase in high-elevation wetland total area over the 1984–2011 period in the Cordillera Real of Bolivia. Changes in wetland cover were positively correlated to precipitation intensities but showed high inter-annual variability. Because precipitation time series did not display any significant trend over the (1984–2011) period it is likely that part of the observed increase in wetland area could be related to an increase frequency in extreme precipitation events over the last decades, a reality that is predicted to accentuate in the future [

While we found no relationship between ENSO indices and wetland area or precipitation intensity (results not shown) our data showed longer duration and more intense precipitations events during some negative ENSO years, like 1999–2000 and 2010–2011, in agreement with previous reports in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Such intense events coincided with an increased number of LANDSAT cells with high NDVI index, supporting the importance of extreme climatic events in shaping arid and semi-arid ecosystems [

In addition to changes in melt water supplies (see below), inter-annual precipitations are likely to play a significant role in wetland cover dynamics but further studies are needed to better understand the underlying mechanism in play. Indeed, changes in wetland cover depend not only on the distribution and intensity of precipitation but also on the land surface properties that control how precipitation is partitioned among evaporation, storage at the surface and at depth, and runoff [
