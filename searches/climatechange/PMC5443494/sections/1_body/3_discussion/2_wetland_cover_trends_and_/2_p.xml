<p class="p">Contrastingly to precipitation time series, the time series of glacier and snow-covered surface revealed a significant reduction of about 35 % over the (1984–2011) period. This estimation is in the range of those reported by several, detailed glacier-balance studies performed in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Glacier reduction coincided with wetland increase over the study period, and our multiple regression model revealed that the “glacier term” improved the predictive power of the model made by precipitations alone. While correlation does not imply causation, the widely observed increase in ice melt rates in the tropical Andes is expected to a short-term increase in water availability at high elevation [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Existing glacier retreat scenarios in the Andes suggest that the increase in water availability will not last and that the observed positive trend in wetland cover is likely to be reversed in a near future [e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Indeed, the current increase in glacier runoff is expected to slow until it reaches its maximum and then start a pronounced decline until the glacier has no more influence on outflows [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. The probability of this sequence to occur is very high in significantly glacierized watersheds, which is the case for most wetlands in our study area. Also, higher temperatures and excess in water from nearby glacier melt may induce a rapid vegetation growth, a phenomenon that has been evidenced in several landscapes worldwide undergoing an important glacier shrinkage over recent years/decades, e.g., in Chile [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. In the Cordillera Real, smaller 
 <italic class="italic">Distichia</italic> peat areas are found in slopes or plateaus with high runoff or seepage and their formation could be favored during prolonged periods of high runoff (FA and OD, pers. obs.). However, the importance of glacial contribution to runoff is complex as it depends on the magnitude of other components of the hydrological cycle, and is thus regionally highly variable [
