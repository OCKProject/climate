<p class="p">Interestingly, our results suggest that the drying process of wetland habitat can be partly buffered by glacier cover in the wetlands’ catchment, as the drying rate was negatively correlated with percentage of glacier cover in the catchment. This is an important finding in the context of climate change (temperatures are predicted to increase by 5°C over the next 90 years in the Andes, [

While glaciers seem to play a significant role in the future of wetland conservation in the Cordillera Real, intrinsic factors such as wetland area and shape index are by far the most reliable variables to predict whether they will be prone to drying or not. This may have strong consequences for biodiversity [
