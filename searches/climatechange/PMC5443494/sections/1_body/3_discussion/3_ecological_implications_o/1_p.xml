<p class="p">While we found an overall increase in wetland cover over the (1984–2011) period, this trend was not associated with larger areas of individual wetlands but rather to an increase in the total number of wetlands (

 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. appearance of new, more or less temporary wetlands). As mentioned earlier, our definition of “wetlands” ranges from wet grasslands to peat bogs and it is likely that the documented increase in wetland cover mainly concerned the “wet grassland” category. In contrast with the dominant, cushion-forming species of high Andean wetlands, which require several decades to colonize new habitats in a changing environment [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], species of the Poaceae family have the capacity to perform rapid colonization in alpine systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. In our systems, heavy precipitations and accumulation of water into small depression are expected to rapidly trigger the growth of Poaceae. While these plant assemblages can be consumed by livestock and serve as foraging grounds to wild fauna, they are far from presenting the same economical value than more perennial and complex wetlands like peat bogs, which develop up to 10 m-depth organic soils with exceptionally high water retention and forage for livestock during dry seasons [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. From a conservation perspective, Poaceae-dominated wetlands have been shown to shelter more generalist species, which are also observed outside wetlands, thus not providing a long-term habitats for the specific biodiversity of cushion-dominated wetlands [

Moreover, the monitoring of individual perennial wetland dynamics over the study period clearly demonstrated that they were subject to frequent drying events. These wetlands provide important wildlife habitat in the tropical Andes and the functional connectivity of those habitat patches is crucial for the persistence and resilience of spatially structured wild populations [
