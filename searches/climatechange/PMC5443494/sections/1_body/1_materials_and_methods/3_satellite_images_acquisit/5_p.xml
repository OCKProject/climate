To automate the image processing, a classification algorithm was generated; divided into three steps: 1) images corrections, 2) classification, and 3) topological control for the final categorization of objects. The algorithm allowed obtaining for each LANDSAT image used in the study a vector layer of the extent of the glacier/snow and wetlands present in the images. These layers can be overlaid to illustrate the spatio-temporal changes in the study variables. We then calculated the total area and number of wetlands, and the area of glaciers and snow-covered surfaces directly from each annual layer.
