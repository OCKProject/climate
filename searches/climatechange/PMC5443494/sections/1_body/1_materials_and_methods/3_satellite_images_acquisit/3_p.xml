<p class="p">All images were corrected and digitally processed in the same way. Before generating indexes and classification (see 3.3) the following operations were performed: 1) co-registration of images, 2) atmospheric correction, and 3) conversion of digital numbers to reflectance values. Co-registration was performed with the tool 
 <italic class="italic">AutoSync</italic> of ERDAS IMAGINE v.2011 software. This tool algebraically recognizes the coordinates of common points between two satellite images and co-register them automatically using stereo-correlation between the two images. To carry out this process, a reference image is chosen to which all other images are geometrically corrected. In our case the LANDSAT 7 ETM+ from July 11, 2002 Band 8 was chosen as the reference image. The atmospheric correction process was performed with the tool 
 <italic class="italic">ATCOR3</italic> (Atmospheric correction v.3 GEOSYSTEMS GmbH company) of ERDAS IMAGINE software. For this processing, the program requires using a DEM from which different topographic variables are calculated: the slope, the aspect, elevation and sky-view factor. In addition, the tool also considers the exact time of the image acquisition, which provides information about the zenith and azimuthal positions of the sun, and therefore the incidence angles during the image acquisition. The transformation of the satellite image pixels digital numbers to reflectance values was performed using the 
 <italic class="italic">LANDSAT Reflectance</italic> tool of ERDAS IMAGINE software. To carry out this process, we used the radiometric sensor calibration parameters available in the metadata files for each satellite image. This process allows taking into account the inclination of the sun at the time of the image capture.
