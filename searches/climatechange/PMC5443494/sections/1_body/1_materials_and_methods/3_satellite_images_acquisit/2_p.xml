 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175814.s003" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> presents the list of the used LANDSAT images covering the period 1984â€“2011 and the PLEIADES images from 2013. All the images were recorded during the dry season (between May and August) to ensure minimal snow-cover and cloud-cover. This period is also the most relevant for conservation and development issues as native fauna and livestock strongly depend upon wetland pastures during the dry season. Landsat images were selected for their radiometric characteristics and spatial resolution (15 m in panchromatic and 30 m in multispectral); such images are widely used for multi-temporal analysis of wetlands [

The LANDSAT 7 ETM+ images after May 31, 2003 were dismissed as, from this date, these images present systematic stripes, due to a malfunction of the sensor (SLC-off). PLEIADES images were acquired for their high resolution (0.5 m) allowing complementary information to be accessible. The ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model version 2 (GDEM,
