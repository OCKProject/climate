<p class="p">All images were classified by normalized difference indexes for vegetation and snow (NDVI, NDSI) that allows automatically identifying on satellite images different types of objects from changes in their own spectral characteristics in different bands [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. To determine the threshold of vegetation, we used the high spatial resolution PLEIADES images. Indeed, wetlands are easily recognizable at a 50-cm resolution. The comparison of the real-color image and a combination bands involving the near-infrared band allowed us to distinguish and then to manually delineate the wetlands outline on the PLEIADES images using a GIS (

For the LANDSAT images, to determine the NDVI threshold allowing us accessing to the most accurate delineation of a wetland, we relied on the fact that the area of the entity extracted by using a NDVI threshold value is a function of the threshold value (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175814.s003" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). So there is a relationship between the surface areas determined for any entity on the LANDSAT image using a NDVI threshold and the surface area of the same entity delineated on the PLEIADES image. This allowed us defining the most accurate threshold that maximizes the correlation of the two surface areas. We used 33 wetlands and compared their surface area computed on the PLEIADES image and a LANDSAT images with different NDVI thresholds to obtain the used value of 0.468 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175814.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). The overall uncertainty on the wetlands surface area was computed as the horizontal uncertainty of the position of the margin of the polygon representing a wetland. This horizontal uncertainty was quantified by varying the NDVI threshold from 0.448 to 0.488. These values match an interval of +/- 0.02 on the used NDVI threshold value of 0.468 and allow conserving a low RMSE value when comparing the wetland delineation between the PLEIADES and LANDSAT images for 2011 (see Supp. Mat.). This uncertainty varies from one year to another from few km
