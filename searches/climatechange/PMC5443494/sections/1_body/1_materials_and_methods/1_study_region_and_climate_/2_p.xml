<p class="p">The climate of this tropical cordillera is characterized by a low annual temperature range (&lt; 5°C) with a slight peak in summer (December–February) when solar radiation and air moisture are at their maximum. Incident solar radiation is strong all year round and not seasonally contrasted due to the low latitude and because at its maximum (in summer) it is attenuated by pronounced cloudiness. On the other hand, when incident solar radiation is minimum (May–August) the atmosphere is dry and cloudiness is not a limiting factor. In contrast, seasonality of humidity and precipitation is strong. Humid and precipitation fluxes come from the northeast via the Amazonian basin and precipitation can reach 800–1000 mm yr

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. As a consequence, the eastern side of the Cordillera is more humid than the western side. The October–December period is characterized by a progressive increase in moisture and precipitation. Accumulation rates reach maximum between January and April (2/3 of the total amounts). The period between May and September is characterized by a dry atmosphere, strong westerly winds at high elevations, low cloudiness, and cooler temperatures. The seasonal pattern displays significant modifications due to climatic variability that is mainly controlled by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases at the multiannual time scale [

However, precipitation regimes in the southern region of the tropical Andean are moderately correlated with sea surface temperature anomalies with a ENSO–rainfall signal highly variable depending on latitude, elevation and the side of the Andes [
