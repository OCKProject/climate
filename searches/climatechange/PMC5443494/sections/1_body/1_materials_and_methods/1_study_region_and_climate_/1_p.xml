<p class="p">The Cordillera Real (15°45’– 16°45’ South, 67°40’– 68°40’ West) is part of the Bolivian Eastern Cordillera between the Altiplano plateau in the west and the Amazon basin in the east. The Cordillera Real stretches from south-south-east to north-north-west over 130 km with an approximate width of 15–20 km (
