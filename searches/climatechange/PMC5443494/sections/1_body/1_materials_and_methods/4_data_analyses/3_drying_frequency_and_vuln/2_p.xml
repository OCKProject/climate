<p class="p">Individual wetland monitoring cannot be automated in GIS and has to be performed manually. For this reason, of the 705 wetlands identified in 1984 in the study region, we randomly selected a sub-sample of 423 entities for this analysis. Drying events resulted in the division of wetlands in a certain number of fragments. For each year (between 1984 and 2011), a value was assigned for each fragment of one wetland entity thereby allowing counting the number of fragments resulting from drying since 1984. We recognize that using the mean of several years as a reference "wetland state" may have been more robust than a single year to perform our trend analyses, but it was technically impossible to run the "individual wetland monitoring" by using several years as a baseline. However, we consider that 1984 was an appropriate reference year, as it presented baseline values of wetland cover and number over the three decades (similar values were found in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1990, 1992, 1995, and 1998; see
