<p class="p">We then used Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) to test the effects on wetland drying frequency of five variables used in the ANCOVA analysis (elevation, slope, wetland area, wetland watershed area, glacier cover in the watershed) and their interactions. A term ‘‘valley” was included to allow within-site comparisons, while controlling variations resulting from unmeasured valley-specific variables (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. hydrology, local climatic conditions). Valley was treated as a fixed effect, but we obtained similar results by means of the generalized linear mixed model function (glmmPQL; MASS library for R), with valley as random effect. To this list of seven factors we added another variable commonly used in habitat conservation studies: the shape of the wetland (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] for a recent review). The shape of a wetland may have significant influences on its functioning and response to climate change as highly convoluted shapes may be more susceptible to disturbances (e.g. drought): a proportionately greater amount of area is exposed to the dry matrix surrounding wetlands [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], we calculated a shape index (SI) of wetland units by dividing the unit perimeter by that of an equal-sized circle as follows:
