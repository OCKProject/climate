<p class="p">Based on these analyses, we calculated the drying frequency of each individual wetland, 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. the number of years over the 1984â€“2011 period for which several fragments were detected on the location of the reference wetland (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0175814.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). We also calculated the drying intensity, 
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. the average number of fragments resulting from drying, but as the two indices were highly correlated (&gt; 0.67) we decided to present only the drying frequency.
