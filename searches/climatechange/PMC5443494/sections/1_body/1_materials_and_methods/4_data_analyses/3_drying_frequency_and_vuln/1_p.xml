<p class="p">As each wetland presents highly diverse features that may affect its response to environmental alteration, individual wetland monitoring is essential to understand spatio-temporal dynamics and define factors that drive these changes. In particular, we observed on the satellite images that many individual wetlands were prone to dry out partially. The appearance of dry patches resulted in a reduction of the overall surface of available high-quality habitat for flora and fauna and of the connectivity among irrigated patches. Wetland patch drying can occur at different spatial scales with a potentially strong impact on a spatially structured plant and animal populations, especially for small organisms with limited mobility. These constitute the bulk of alpine wetland biodiversity. Even limited drying of tenths of meters can have significant impacts on population dispersal patterns living in alpine ecosystems, as shown for amphibians [
