<p class="p">To assess whether changes in wetland area was related to change in precipitations, we used precipitation data obtained over the (1984–2011) period from a meteorological station located in the Zongo valley (16°15’ S, 68°10’ W,

 <italic class="italic">e</italic>. within the study area). It is noteworthy that this station is the only one within our study area covering the entire study period. We tested the cross-correlation between the wetland area at time t, and the monthly precipitation over 1 to 12 months before time t, using the correlation function estimation in R. The best correlation was obtained for a period of three months prior to image acquisition. Wetland areas were then plotted against monthly precipitation and glacier and snow-covered surfaces measured over the study period. The R-value and the p-value of each slope coefficient were also calculated. We then combined the two predictive variables into a single multiple linear regression.
