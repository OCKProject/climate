<p class="p">We selected six ecologically relevant factors for which we tested their significance in influencing the overall wetland area trend: 1) elevation (m a.s.l.), 2) orientation (west/east), 3) slope (degrees from horizontal), 4) initial wetland size (

The glacier outlines and watershed contours shape files were merged using ArcGIS 10.0. This enabled computing the percentage of the glacier cover in the watersheds, a commonly used index to estimate the potential influence of a glacier on an aquatic system (e.g., [
