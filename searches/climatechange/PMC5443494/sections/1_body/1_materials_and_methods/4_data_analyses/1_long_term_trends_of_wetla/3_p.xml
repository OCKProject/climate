<p class="p">We then used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to determine if statistically significant differences in wetland area temporal trends depended on these six factors: orientation (west 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. east), elevation, slope, glacier cover in the catchment, initial wetland size and watershed area. For the five latter variables we compared the first and the last quartiles of each wetland variable distribution (e.g., 25% largest 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. 25% smallest wetlands, 25% steepest 
 <italic class="italic">vs</italic>. 25% flattest wetlands and so on).
