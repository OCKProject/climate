<p class="p">We estimated the regional long-term trends in wetland surface area by fitting linear models allowing different slopes and intercepts to be computed (ordinary least squares). The R-value and the p-value of each slope coefficient were also calculated. Due to the unknown correlated structure of the model, these statistics aim to provide information of the fitted linear trend of each time series, rather than testing a hypothesis.</p>
