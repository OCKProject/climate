<p class="p">Three environmental variables significantly affected the observed temporal increase in wetland surface area over the last 30 years: orientation, watershed surface area and initial wetland size in 1984 (

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Surface area expansion was stronger for large wetlands draining large watersheds and located on the western side of the Cordillera. Elevation, slope and the percent of glacier cover in the catchment (% GCC) had no significant effect on the temporal trend in wetland area increase. We found no significant effect on the interaction between time and environmental variables on wetlands surface area trends.
