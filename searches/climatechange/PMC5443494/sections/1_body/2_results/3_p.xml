<p class="p">While monthly precipitations showed no significant trends over the (1984â€“2011) period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g006" class="xref">Fig 6A</xref>), we found a significant decrease in the area of glaciers and snow-covered surfaces over the same period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g006" class="xref">Fig 6C</xref>, p &lt; 0.001). Total wetland area was significantly positively correlated with the monthly precipitation values over the three months preceding the LANDSAT image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g006" class="xref">Fig 6B</xref>, p = 0.004). Glacier and snow-covered surface areas also correlated negatively with total wetland area but the relationship was barely significant (p = 0.04). By combining the two predictors (glacier and snow-covered surfaces, GSC and precipitation, PP) into a multiple regression model, changes in wetland area (W) were predicted by the following equation: W = -0.064 GSC + 1.10 PP + 66.12. The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> value of the two-variable model increased by 0.17 (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.42) compared to the R
