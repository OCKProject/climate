We also found a strong inter-annual variability in both wetland surface area and number, and a strong positive correlation between these two variables (slope = 3.0, R

While the total surface area of wetlands significantly increased over the last 30 years, the distribution of individual wetland size showed no detectable temporal trend in mean and median values. However, we observed a barely significant increase in the top-quartile values of individual wetland surface area over time (slope = 0.8, R
