<p class="p">By following individually a subsample of 423 wetlands, we analyzed wetland-drying frequency as an indicator of wetland vulnerability over the last 30 years. Among the eight variables included in our GLM analysis, %GCC (Likelihood ratio test = 4.7, p = 0.02;

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g007" class="xref">Fig 7C</xref>) were the only single variables that significantly affected wetland drying rate over the last 30 years: round wetlands and those located in highly glacierized catchments were less prone to drying. While the ‘initial area of wetland’ was not significant in the GLM (see

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g007" class="xref">Fig 7B</xref>), its interaction with SI was by far the most significant term affecting wetland drying over the last 30 years (LRT = 48.4, p &lt; 0.0001;
