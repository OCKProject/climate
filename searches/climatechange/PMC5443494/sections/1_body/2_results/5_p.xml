 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g007" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>, we built a predictive map of the drying vulnerability for the 1689 wetlands recorded in 2011 the Cordillera Real (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). Our vulnerability index was calculated as follows: wetland with small area (first quartile of the entire population) and large SI (fourth quartile of the entire population) were considered as highly sensitive to drying and therefore highly vulnerable in the future (red dots, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). Wetlands with large area (fourth quartile) and low SI (first quartile) had a low vulnerability status (green dots) while the rest of wetlands had an intermediate vulnerability status (orange dots). Of the 1689 wetlands a majority (85.3 %) showed an intermediate vulnerability, 8.5 % showed a high vulnerability and 6.2 % showed a low vulnerability.
