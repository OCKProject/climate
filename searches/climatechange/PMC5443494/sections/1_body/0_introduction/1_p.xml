 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. One promising approach to study the integrated effects of climate change on biodiversity and on ecosystem services involves monitoring the responses of entire ecosystems, as they may represent sensitive indicators of both drivers and responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. As the overall distribution of ecosystems largely reflects current climate conditions, it is likely that changes in temperature, precipitation, and carbon dioxide levels, together with additional environmental changes (e.g., grazing intensity, glacier melting, invasive species) would significantly alter the geographical distribution of ecosystems [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Furthermore, rapid and widespread modifications in the geographical distribution of entire ecosystems may deeply impact biogeochemical cycles (e.g., water and carbon) at both local and regional levels [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Climate change is also expected to alter significantly the quality and the quantity of natural resources to human societies [
