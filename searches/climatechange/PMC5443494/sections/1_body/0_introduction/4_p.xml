<p class="p">In this study, we used a combination of high-resolution satellite images (PLEIADES) and the LANDSAT archive to map the location and extent of wetlands across the Cordillera Real of Bolivia, and to quantify changes in their surface area over the last 30 years. As high-altitude wetlands in the Bolivian Andes are almost entirely covered by vegetation (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), our satellite image analyses mainly documented changes in vegetation cover and dynamics over time. Vegetation dynamics finely responds to changes in water and soil conditions, in turn influenced by climate change. The two specific objectives of this study were 1) to identify environmental factors (e.g., glacier cover in the catchment, wetland size, and watershed size) that affect wetland long-term surface changes at both regional and individual scales, and 2) to identify the characteristics of individual wetlands (e.g., shape, size, and location in the catchment) that control their propensity to dry (as a result of changes in abiotic conditions). This latter objective intends to allow developing a vulnerability map of high altitude wetlands to guide conservation plan.
