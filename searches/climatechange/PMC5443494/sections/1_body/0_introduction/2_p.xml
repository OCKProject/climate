<p class="p">Ecosystem sentinels for global changes have already been identified for several biomes throughout the world such as savannas [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. However, in most cases, it remains difficult to disentangle climate change effects from anthropogenic pressures. Ideally, ecosystem sentinels should present both a high sensitivity to climate change and a low one to human perturbation so that it is possible to identify early signals of climate change and variability while minimizing the number of confounding factors potentially masking its detection [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. While these ecosystems have been identified since the late 1990’s as ideal candidates to set up environmental observatories of the ecological effects of climate change (e.g., The Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine environments—[
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]), the lack of historical data in such remote and understudied regions has not allowed to obtain information on how entire natural communities and ecosystems have responded to recent patterns in climate change [
