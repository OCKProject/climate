<p class="p">In the cordilleras of the tropical Andes, high-elevation wetlands (over 4500 m above sea level, a.s.l.) are located in environments of relatively low annual precipitation and soil moisture deficits within a region also known as 
 <italic class="italic">puna</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. These wetlands can be described as areas of swamp, marsh, meadow, fen or peatlands, perennial or temporary, with water that is stagnant or flowing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). These ecosystems may represent ideal ecosystem sentinels of the effects of recent climate change for several reasons (see also [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]). First, most of these wetlands are located in topographical depressions either downstream from glaciers that are rapidly receding ([

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0175814.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>) or within small watersheds presenting a strong coupling between atmospheric forcing (precipitation patterns) and water flows [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. The contribution of glaciers to water input may account for as much as 27% during the dry season [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], explaining why their recession/disappearance may affect adjacent wetlands. Second, high-elevation wetlands in the Andes provide important biogeochemical functions such as water flow regulation and organic matter accumulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Their functioning can be easily affected by the change of climatic conditions as a simultaneous increase in temperature and decrease in water level may favor soil oxygenation, organic matter decomposition and, in turn, the release of large amounts of CO

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. There is experimental evidence that persistently high temperatures can reduce carbon accumulation in peatlands by up to 30% owing to the decline of plant productivity and the rise of microbial decomposition of organic matter [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In the high Andes, a 3°C increase in temperature could result in a theoretical 600-m upward movement of plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], with potential impacts on wetland flora composition. All this can have potentially significant consequences for carbon storage/release dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] and wetland productivity that maintains an extensive camelid pastoralism supporting over 700,000 rural Andean households in the region [

 <xref rid="pone.0175814.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Third, being “wetlands in drylands”, Andean high-elevation wetlands can be easily detected and delimited using satellite images. Indeed, optical satellite data (e.g., LANDSAT) provide quite large time series (30 years) with an access to near infrared bands, which is effective to assess vegetation density [
