Model results were consistent with predictions 39% of the time (13/31 datasets). The direction of even well-supported effects sometimes differed among sites. For example, cold temperature (H8) was in the top model for 11/31 data sets but the direction of the effect at 7/11 sites was contrary to our prediction of decreased recruitment with increased freezing events. Other covariates appeared in top models but results were split evenly between the direction of the effect supporting or countering our predictions. Parameter estimates (model-averaged across all sites) indicated the most support for models that included drought (H6, β = 0.001, SE = 3.60E-05) and early winter (H9, β = 0.001, SE = 4.60E-05) (

The covariates in the top models for recruitment were poor predictors of the hypothesized effect (i.e., they had weak estimated effect and high uncertainty) in all zones, although half of the top models in the montane zone followed our predictions.
