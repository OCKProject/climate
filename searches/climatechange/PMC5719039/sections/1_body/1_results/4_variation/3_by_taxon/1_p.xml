<p id="Par14" class="p">In top models for survival, where the effect was in the predicted direction, hypotheses explained 10–69% of the variation for survival in frogs (ranids and treefrogs), 11–46% of the variation for survival in toads, and 10–44% of the variation in newts (S6B). In top recruitment models where the effect was in the predicted direction, the amount of variation explained was 6–53% for frogs (ranids and treefrogs), 8–46% for toads, and 19–41% for newts (
