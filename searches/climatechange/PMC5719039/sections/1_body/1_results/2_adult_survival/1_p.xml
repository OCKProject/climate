While most of the sites in the Mediterranean zone (8/9) followed predictions for the hypothesized direction of the effect, only about half of the maritime (4/7) and montane (7/15) sites followed our predictions. For most sites (23/31), top models for survival included winter-related covariates (H3, H4, H5). QAICc weights and r

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) indicated that models that included the length of winter (H3) and winter severity (H4) were often best supported. Covariates in top models more often followed the predicted direction for frogs (13/17 populations) and salamanders and newts (3/5 populations) than for toads (3/9 populations). The direction of the effect of the covariate in the top model was more often as predicted for aquatic hibernators (11/15) than for terrestrial hibernators (8/16).
