<p id="Par9" class="p">We analyzed data from 11 species and 31 populations where individuals were captured annually from 10 to 28 years (average = 15.3 yrs). We found evidence for an influence of climate on demography (Akaike weight &gt;0.40, 18/31 datasets), although the magnitude and direction of responses to climate drivers was highly variable. Capture probabilities ranged from &lt;0.01–0.74, mean 0.16 (

Survival and recruitment estimates were within published norms for all species, taxa were not evenly distributed among climate zones (5 species in maritime, 2 in Mediterranean, and 5 in montane) and population sizes varied. For example, in the Mediterranean zone, 8 of 9 datasets were from small populations of ranid frogs in California.
