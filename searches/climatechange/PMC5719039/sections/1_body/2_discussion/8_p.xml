<p id="Par23" class="p">Our analysis convincingly illustrates a pattern of local responses to similar climate-related stressors and fails to support an overarching effect of climate change on amphibian demographics. The variability we observed in demographic response, within and among species and populations, emphasizes the potential for species to adapt to local conditions and persist in changing environments, and is concomitant to the variability found among regions (i.e., different stressors in different regions, sensu

 </sup>). These data provide population-level evidence to support a local, rather than a centralized, approach to conservation and illustrate the critical conservation need to maintain variability at every taxonomic level.
