<p id="Par20" class="p">Three boreal toad populations in the Rocky Mountains occur in similar habitats, yet there was little uniformity in the survival model best supported by the data, and demographic response to covariates was often contrary to predictions. Models including the recurrence of warm events during winter (H5) had the most support, but affected survival as predicted (negatively) in only one population (at the highest elevation). High snowpack provides insulation during winter and lack of insulation can precipitate inappropriate rousing and waste of energy

 </sup>. The criticality of this insulation, and thus the response in survival rate, likely depends on the elevation and physiogeography of local sites.
