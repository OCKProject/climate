<p id="Par17" class="p">Our analyses of 31 long-term demographic datasets revealed variable demographic responses to climate variables both within and across species, and within and across climatic zones. In 18 of 31 datasets, the top candidate models were strongly supported with AIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> wts of &gt;0.40; in nine of those 18, AIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> wts were &gt;0.90. We considered this to be strong support because 0.4 is 10 times greater than the AIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> wt one would expect if all models were equally supported (i.e., for each dataset we developed 30 models for survival and 25 for recruitment. If all models had equal support, we would expect an AIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> wt of 0.04 (1/25) or 0.03 (1/30) respectively. Thus, our analysis provides empirical support for the effect of climate variables on demographic processes across multiple amphibian taxa and across multiple localities. The influence of the covariates was also supported by the amount of variation explained by the hypotheses. In a majority of datasets, â‰¥25% of the variation was explained for both survival and recruitment, further highlighting the importance of climate.
