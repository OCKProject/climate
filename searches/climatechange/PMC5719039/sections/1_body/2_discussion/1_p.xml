<p id="Par16" class="p">We provide empirical evidence for the idea that climate is one of the overarching drivers for change in amphibian demographics and that demographic parameters are influenced by climate-related covariates for amphibian populations in multiple temperate climates. Although there are numerous single species (or single locale) studies that examine how amphibians respond to their environment
