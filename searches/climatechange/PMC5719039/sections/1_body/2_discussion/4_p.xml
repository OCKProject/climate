<p id="Par19" class="p">We hypothesized that we would see similar demographic responses to climate-related covariates across climatic zones and species, and that such uniformity might suggest that local responses to specific local conditions were being over-ridden. Contrary to our hypothesis, we identified a variety of responses both within and among amphibian species, suggesting that response to climate is highly context-dependent and that conservation planning will require a local approach despite the expected magnitude of climate change and potential for climate forcing. For example, there is a need to better determine how context-dependency can mediate the effect of climate on local populations and promote their resilience. Local contexts may include geographic, biotic and abiotic factors that differ in importance (e.g., climate forcing
