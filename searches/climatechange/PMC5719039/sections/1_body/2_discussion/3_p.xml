<p id="Par18" class="p">While no single covariate emerged as a main driver of demographic variation, in the majority of datasets, winter-related covariates were in the top models for both survival and recruitment, and 65% and 46% of these top models indicated that the effect was negative (decreased survival and decreased recruitment respectively). Although we might expect winter covariates to occur in top models 60% of the time by chance alone, a range of previous work highlights the importance of winter covariates. For example a synthesis of organismal responses to winter climate change reports that community composition, ecological interactions, and individual performance are affected by winter
