 </sup> performed in several steps, 1) select the best covariate structure for capture probability, keeping a full-time varying structure for survival and recruitment, 2) select the best covariate structure, regarding sex effects for survival and recruitment probabilities, and 3) assess the relative support for each hypothesis for each dataset. Models were selected using AIC corrected for small sample size (AIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>) and overdispersion (QAIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub>) by a variance inflation factor (ĉ). For each dataset, ĉ was calculated (program RELEASE global test: TEST 2 + TEST 3; 51). A value of ĉ = 1 was assumed when the calculated ĉ was&lt;1. QAIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> weights were also used to assess the degree of support for each model. First, we assessed three hypotheses for capture probability: 1) 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> constant [p(.)]; 2) 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> as a linear function of capture occasion within each year; and 3) 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> as a quadratic function of capture occasion within each year. We tested for differences in detection probability between sexes when data were available. We selected the model with the most support for 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> and used that parameterization in all subsequent models. Next, we assessed the effect of sex on survival and recruitment for datasets with that information. If an effect of sex was supported, it was included in subsequent models. We then assessed the support for each hypotheses to quantifying the influence of each covariate on demographic parameters. Survival and recruitment are estimated simultaneously in Pradel models, thus, for each dataset, we assessed all possible combinations of 6 hypotheses for survival (H0-H5) and 5 hypotheses for recruitment (H0, H6-H9): 30 competing models (6 × 5 = 30 combinations). Hypothesis 4 was not relevant for 15 datasets (25 competing models (5 × 5 combinations). Parameter estimates from top models, and cumulative QAIC
 <sub class="sub">c</sub> weights were used to quantify the degree of support for each hypothesis. We then compared the magnitude and the direction of influence of each covariate relative to 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> predictions.
