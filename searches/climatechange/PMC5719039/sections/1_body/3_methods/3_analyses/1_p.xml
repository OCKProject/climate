 </sup>. Apparent survival is defined as the probability of an adult individual surviving and not permanently emigrating from the study site between sampling occasions t and t + 1 and recruitment is defined as the ratio of new adults entering the focal population between year t and year t + 1 to the number of adults that were already present in the population (and exposed to capture) in sampling season t

 </sup>. Recruitment encompasses two sources of new adults entering the focal population: 1) juveniles from the local population becoming adults and 2) immigration of adults from nearby populations. We assume that the majority of recruitment originated from local juvenile-to-adult transitions such that our measures of recruitment are representative of the local breeding process, although we acknowledge that this assumption may not hold for species with high dispersal rates

 </sup>. Capture probability is the probability that a marked individual is available for detection (i.e., present at the site) and is detected during a sampling period. We used the robust design version of the Pradel model for all datasets except 7 and 8, where there was only a single visit per season, for those datasets we used the non-robust design version of the Pradel model
