This strategy ensured that while we addressed consistent ecological hypotheses that might influence population dynamics, we allowed for the specific form of the influence to reflect local conditions. Because our interest was the mechanisms relating population fluctuations to relevant climate variables, this distinction, and focus on local conditions, is more appropriate than selecting a single consistent (large-scale) variable, and ensures that any deviation from expectation does not result from an inappropriate large-scale variable.
