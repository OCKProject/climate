<p id="Par27" class="p">We developed a set of 9 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> hypotheses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) to investigate the potential influence of environmental covariates with input from all the data providers. Hypotheses related environmental factors (water availability and temperature) to probabilities of survival (ϕ) and recruitment (f). Hypotheses were based on the reliance of our study species on standing water bodies and on our interpretation of the likely response (physiological or physical) of amphibians to extremes in temperatures. We developed five hypotheses for survival and four for recruitment.
