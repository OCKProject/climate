<p id="Par32" class="p">We ran full-time varying models for survival (Φ
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>) and recruitment (f
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>) to provide annual estimates of these parameters, for each site. We plotted annual estimates and predicted annual values from the best supported covariate model (S3). We subsequently derived inter-annual values of population growth λ
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>, as λ
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> = Φ
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> + f
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> for each and plotted annual estimates to illustrate the trajectory for each population (S7).
