 </sup> (S6). This test relies on an F-statistic based on the deviances, and the corresponding degrees of freedom, of models assuming full-time variation (F
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>), constancy (F
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) and covariate-driven variation (F
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>, our nine covariates) for the parameter of interest (e.g., survival), and assuming the best supported parameterization for the other model parameters (i.e., capture probability and recruitment). Using ratios of deviances from these models, we calculated the proportion of variation (r²) explained by each covariate (r² = Dev(F
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) − Dev(F
 <sub class="sub">H</sub>)/Dev(F
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) − Dev(F
 <sub class="sub">t</sub>)). We assessed the amount of variation explained by grouping data sets by taxonomy; life history (i.e., hibernation site – aquatic vs terrestrial); and by environment (maritime, Mediterranean, or montane) (S6A, B).
