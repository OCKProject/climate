  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>: landscape, where over-arching processes produce similarity in demographic rates (e.g., alignment across populations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>, and local, where over-arching processes manifest differently and produce differences in demographic rates (e.g., increased local variation). Directional changes in climate, such as long-term shifts in mean precipitation and timing, can act at a landscape scale and influence populations across a large area
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>, whereas outcomes of such shifts (e.g., amount of snowpack or hydroperiod length) can act at local scales and affect only individual populations because the shifts are mediated by other factors that vary locally (e.g., soil type). For example, a broad scale effect is illustrated by the link between climate change and the collapse of population cycles

 </sup>, and a local effect is illustrated by the influence of snow depth as a consequence of the weather on the synchrony in population growth rates
