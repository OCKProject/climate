 </sup>. Typically, local conditions, unrelated to weather, buffer against climatic fluctuations. However, the current magnitude and rate of climate change suggest that forcing of regional water availability (i.e., drought) and temperature has the potential to over-ride local variation in these characteristics, leading to an alignment in among-population demographic rates. For example, many temperate amphibian species exist as metapopulations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, but demography in populations fluctuates in response to local conditions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
