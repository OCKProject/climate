<p id="Par7" class="p">Current knowledge about the response of amphibian populations to climate is based largely on analyses of single-population datasets. Furthermore, when large-scale drivers are filtered through local site and population characteristics

 </sup>, it is difficult to identify common factors driving demographic trends. The identification of common population responses to changes in climate can be improved by articulating and testing hypotheses about responses of demographic rates to environmental covariates using long-term data from multiple species within single taxa. This information will improve understanding of the relative contribution of regional and local drivers which are critical for estimating adaptive capacity and choosing conservation actions.
