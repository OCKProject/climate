<p id="Par4" class="p">While large-scale climate conditions can synchronize population dynamics, local environmental conditions often mediate the effects of regional drivers, such that local populations vary asynchronously and are thus more resilient to large-scale climate variation (e.g.,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>). Conversely, if demographic rates of populations are synchronized by large-scale environmental forcing, then adverse change in regional conditions may lead to large-scale population declines. Synchronous responses to climate drivers have been identified for populations of different species over large regions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that the potential exists for a single dominant driver to force synchrony in population dynamics by affecting one or more demographic rates. Furthermore, there is evidence that climatic fluctuations contribute to shifts in demographic processes of populations

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup> occur. The geographic extent of amphibian decline contributes to the appeal of this phenomenon as a model system to understand the effects of climate on populations and persistence, and widespread declines in amphibian populations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
