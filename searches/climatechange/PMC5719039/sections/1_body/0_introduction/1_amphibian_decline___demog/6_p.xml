 </sup>, we quantified survival and recruitment in relation to locally derived climate variables to gain a mechanistic understanding of amphibian demographic responses across a range of species and locations. We used long-term (≥10 or more consecutive years), individual-based, information from 31 populations of amphibians from four countries in Europe and North America representing three climatic “zones”: montane, Mediterranean, and maritime (Canada [n = 1], France [n = 5], Germany [n = 2], and USA [n = 23]) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) with which to estimate the effect of climate forcing on demography. Capture-mark-recapture data are uniquely rich and provide the most detailed information on free-ranging populations. Our depth of data allows consideration of hypotheses that relate demographic parameters to broad-scale climate, as represented by specific local climate variables. We selected covariates representing local environmental conditions that are driven by broad-scale climatic changes in temperature and water availability. We predicted demographic responses in a suite of 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> hypotheses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) iteratively developed by expert amphibian researchers with specific knowledge of local populations and habitats – collectively representing &gt;300 years of field expertise. We expected that the demography of species with similar life histories (i.e., terrestrial vs aquatic hibernation), and those inhabiting similar environments (i.e., maritime, Mediterranean, and montane zones) would have similar associations with climate drivers. We also expected that survival, recruitment (i.e., the per capita number of individuals recruited into the breeding populations per year) and population growth rate (i.e., survival + recruitment) might each be influenced in a common manner across populations of amphibian species when they experience similar changes in abiotic conditions. While the magnitude of effect is not expected to be identical among all species and populations, we expected that the direction of the effect would be consistent. Although commonalities among demographic rates or characteristics can exist without synchrony in environmental conditions, synchronous relationships may be an early indicator of population collapse as the buffering that diversity provides is weakened.
