  <p class="p">Hypotheses supported by models (based on the covariate [log-odds] coefficient parameter) are indicated by an arrow. The predicted effect for hypotheses H1 – H8 was negative, but the predicted effect for H9 was positive. Direction of arrow indicates direction of support (H1-H8: down = as predicted, up = contrary to prediction; H9: up = as predicted, and down = contrary to prediction). Data sets are ordered from low to high elevation. See

   <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> for hypotheses. Zone: MAR – maritime, MED – Mediterranean, MON – montane.
