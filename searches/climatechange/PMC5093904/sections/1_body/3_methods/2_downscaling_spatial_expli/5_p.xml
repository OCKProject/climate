<p class="p">Finally, climatological mean annual precipitation (mm) and temperature (°C) maps for each 10 year time step (from 1990–2000) were created by calculating an average temperature and precipitation value for each grid cell from a time window of 25 years previous to the considered time step. This strategy was chosen in order to account as best as possible for the inertia of SOC upon altered climate conditions (note that the turn-over time of SOC in temperate mineral soils is typically in the order of magnitude of a few decades).</p>
