<p class="p">This method satisfactorily describes the regional climate variability at a daily to inter-annual time basis, as shown for instance by the distributions of precipitation. Under the assumption that the model errors are stationary, it allows to account for the changes in climate variability in addition to mean climate change, and thus tackles the evolution of precipitation and temperature extremes.</p>
