<p class="p">The statistical downscaling method is based on weather typing, and is called dsclim. The large-scale circulation, here defined by the mean sea-level pressure and the temperature averaged over Western Europe (predictors), is hereby statistically linked to local-scale climate variables (predictants). The statistical model is established over a learning period (1981â€“2005), whereby the predictors are extracted from the daily NCEP reanalysis, while the predictants are taken from the SAFRAN analysis. The downscaling consists of conditional resampling, by matching the day of the large-scale climate scenario to the day of the SAFRAN analysis with the same weather type and the closest mean sea level pressure and Western Europe averaged temperature. The four standard seasons are processed separately, as different large-scale weather types characterize them.</p>
