<p class="p">Although this model approach allows incorporating all significant interactions between SOC-driving factors at the national scale, it is important to note that these interaction factors are static and therefore do not allow to account for feedbacks between the warming climate and the land surface/soil system in a dynamic context. Hence, embedding models that have the ability to incorporate these feedbacks mechanisms, such as process based models, linking the rate of change of SOC to a wide set of environmental factors (e.g. Roth C, Century)
