<p class="p">This model has been calibrated using input data from various resources covering entire France. SOC measurements from 2,158 sites, following a regular 16 × 16 km grid gathered by the French National Institute for Agriculture Research (INRA) between 2000 and 2009 and recorded in the Réseau de Mesures de la Qualité des Sols (RMQS) soil survey
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67" class="xref">67</xref>, were used. This regular grid sampling design ensured an excellent distribution of data amongst a wide range of soil types, land use and climate combinations. The great heterogeneity of soil types in France is reflected in this database, including sandy soils in the South-West (Podsols), fertile loess soils (Luvisols) in the North as well as various shallow soils (Leptosols) developed from calcareous rocks and dystric Cambisols developed from the weathering of different sorts of parent material
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref>, resulting in a large variability in silt and clay contents
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Climatological data for the model was obtained from the Meteo-France 0.125° × 0.125° climatic grid covering the period 1993–2004, with average yearly temperatures varying between ca. 0 °C and ca. 18 °C and total precipitation amount varying between ca. 500 mm and ca. 2500 mm
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. Manure application and animal excrement production statistics at departmental level were used as main agro-management input data resource
