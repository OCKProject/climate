<p class="p">When performing the logistic regression, a calibration procedure was modeled in R, using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref> and the requirement to have all significant parameters (p &lt; 0.05) as model selection criteria in order to obtain the best model by applying an adapted version of the traditional stepwise regression procedure. The latter deals with the issue when the model, following a traditional stepwise regression procedure, ends-up in a local minimum (i.e. no lower AICc have been obtained when adding or removing 1 variable, but which isn’t the ultimate best model with respect to the given set of variables), by adding or removing more than 1 variable a time. This way the opportunity has been offered to go a few steps back or further at once in order to move out the local minimum, and hence, potentially find a better model (i.e. lower AICc).
