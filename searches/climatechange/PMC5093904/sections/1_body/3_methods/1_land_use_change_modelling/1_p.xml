<p class="p">We conducted future land use change predictions for each of the 22 main administrative areas in France separately, covering the period 1990–2100 following a temporal grid of 10 years. Input data were derived from CORINE land cover maps of 1990 and 2000 with a resolution of 250 m
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>. These 2 land use maps were reclassified in 5 general land use classes in accordance with the requirements of the SOC model
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref> used in this study, i.e. cropland, grassland, forest, vineyard – orchard and urban. Land use change trends observed in the period 1990–2000 were extrapolated in time up to 2100 assuming a
