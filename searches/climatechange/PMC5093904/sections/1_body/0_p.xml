<p class="p">Over the last two decades, there has been a notable growth of interest in monitoring soil organic carbon (SOC) because of the increased awareness of its key role in delivering many ecosystem services

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. In particular, the potential of the soil to act as an important regulator of climate change at the global scale through its active carbon exchange with the atmosphere is highly valued. Given turnover times in the range of years to decades, and a storage capacity higher than the atmosphere and biosphere together, any large scale change in SOC can significantly alter the overall atmospheric CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Furthermore, SOC is known to have an important positive effect on (i) crop yields, maintaining food productivity; (ii) soil aggregate stability and water retention potential, reducing soil erosion and flood risks; and, (iii) pesticide sorption capacity and microbial degradation of nitrates, reducing groundwater contamination

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. As maintaining healthy levels of SOC are crucial to face future climate change and its related food- and water security problems, many studies have focused in detail on how land use, climate, soil type and agro-management alter soil carbon storage. Associated improved process-based understanding of SOC dynamics has resulted in multiple models (e.g. Roth C, Century, DNDC and ICBM), which have been applied across a wide range of scales

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref> as well as international treaties, such as the Kyoto Protocol

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>, underline the clear need for more accurate spatial and temporal explicit estimates of this pool in order to establish appropriate policy measures to combat climate change, land degradation and soil fertility decline threats. Although a significant attempt has been made to produce detailed maps of SOC at the national level, these studies mainly focused on current

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> and the potential influence of climate change on past SOC trends remains debatable

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Since many scenarios clearly suggest that the contribution and amplitude of climate change will become increasingly stronger over the next decades, there exists a clear need to estimate the impact of these rapidly changing conditions on large scale SOC budgets. This will be crucial for mapping associated feedbacks on climate and environmental threats. A few studies investigated the potential SOC stock response during the 21

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>. In these studies, land use change has been claimed to be a critical component explaining future SOC changes. However, the lack of the inclusion of interaction factors between variables that have an important influence on SOC variability at small spatial resolutions (e.g. soil type, climate, land use and agro-management) and/or the integration of rather progressive assumptions of increased net primary production (NPP) (e.g. as a consequence of agro-technological advancement and fertilisation effects due to increased atmospheric CO
