<p class="p">The implication of this study is that only radical land use change coupled with enhanced C-sequestration in productive agricultural land uses (principally cropland) has the potential to mitigate climate change. In contrast, business-as-usual land use change driven by local land use decision-making is likely to lead to significant SOC loss due to the impact of climate change on SOC stocks. Consequently, these results indicate that despite the fact that land use management may be a valid alternative to mitigate climate change on the short-term, this seems to be less effective on the long-term. The positive feedback mechanism between soil C emissions and climate change has been shown to be the main driver of declining SOC levels, which therefore will be the primary factor endangering the functioning of soil’s vital ecosystem services such as food security, aquifer quality, soil erosion protection and flood regulation. In addition and in contrast to previous studies

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> the present research delivers SOC stock change maps at a much finer resolution (250 m) that reflects important interactions at small spatial scales. Maps at this scale are needed by policy makers when conducting targeted management strategies for combating soil fertility decline and to protect associated ecosystem services
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. More specifically, there is scope for counteracting the predicted changes, by using these detailed maps to focus actions on areas characterized by large future SOC stock losses, such as the sandy soils or regions prone to future drying. By promoting or enforcing environment specific land and/or agro-management techniques, such as green manuring, reduced tillage, erosion prevention, smart irrigation, agroforestry and crop rotations

Nevertheless, it will be essential to consider the agroecosystem environment specific settings (i.e. soil type, climate, topography, land use &amp; management history) in each area. Recent studies have highlighted that the effectiveness of conservation tillage practices largely depends on soil type, climate and topographical conditions as well as on crop rotation and the land use management history of the plot

The potential of erosion management related measures in order to enhance soil C sequestration across larger scales on the long term is therefore unsure. Nevertheless, recent research indicates that more promising and widely applicable soil C sequestration management measures include cover crop green manuring
