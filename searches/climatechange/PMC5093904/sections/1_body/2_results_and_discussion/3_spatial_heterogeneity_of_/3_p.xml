<p class="p">Furthermore, urban expansion is causing remarkably large SOC decreases near the edges of almost all existing cities (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>e–j). As urbanization causes SOC to reduce significantly over time, a decline to 0 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> is assumed. Consequently, these SOC stock changes are similar for each SRES climate change scenario and as large as −4.74 ± 1.65 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, −7.46 ± 2.42 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, −7.83 ± 1.80 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and −2.44 ± 1.60 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for conversions from cropland, grassland, forest and vineyard into urban land use (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). This corresponds with a total SOC stock change at the national scale under SRES scenario A1B of −45.77 Mton C, −19.47 Mton C, −15.52 Mton C and −1.71 Mton C, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Despite the fact that comparable SOC stock gains can be made with de-urbanisation, these are uncommon land use changes under the business-as-usual land use change scenario, and hence associate total SOC stock gains at the national scale are rather low, i.e. varying between +3.14Mton C for urban to forest conversions and +0.04 Mton C for urban to Vineyard/Orchard conversions under SRES A1B scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Although land use change on the urban periphery is the most common and the most significant contributor to land use change related SOC change; national SOC stock change is dominated by changes in SOC stocks in areas unaffected by land use change. These SOC stock changes per unit area range from ca. −1 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for unchanged vineyard/orchard, ca. −1.5 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for unchanged cropland to ca. −2 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> for unchanged grassland and forest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), which corresponds to relative net changes of ca. −40% for vineyards and orchards, of ca. −30% for cropland and ca. −25% for grassland and forest. Associated net contribution to the total SOC stock loss at the national scale is very large due to the vast area they occupy. Using SRES A1B scenario as an example, unchanged cropland, grassland and forest are predicted to lose 357, 222, 336 Mton C, respectively; even unchanged vineyard/orchard are predicted to lose 14 Mton C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). Cumulatively, these represent 86% of the predicted national total SOC stock loss due to land use and climate change, indicating that future SOC stock changes are foremost affected by climate change.
