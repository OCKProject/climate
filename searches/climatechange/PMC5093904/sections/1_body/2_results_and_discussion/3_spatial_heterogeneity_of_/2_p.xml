<p class="p">The future SOC maps (based on ARPEGE model) for 2100, show that SOC stocks across the entire French territory, are remarkably lower as compared to the baseline SOC map of 1990 (

 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3e</xref>). These losses become gradually higher under the A1B and A2 scenarios, with in most areas SOC losses exceeding 2 kg C m

 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> and 2.21 ± 1.51 kg C m

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>f,g). Nevertheless, note that there is a very large spatial heterogeneity on these nationwide SOC trends. Absolute differences are generally highest in the more wet regions (i.e. in the west and southwest of France as well in Mountainous regions in the east and south of France). Declining SOC stocks in these environments will most probably be the result of the combined effect of significantly (i) higher temperatures (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>. Despite the fact that on the other hand drier conditions may results as well in a lower degree of microbial activity and thus a lower degree of decomposition, it is most probable that the decreased C input will be the dominant factor resulting in an overall reduction of SOC. This can also be observed nowadays in most Mediterranean dryland regions which are commonly characterized by very low SOC concentrations
