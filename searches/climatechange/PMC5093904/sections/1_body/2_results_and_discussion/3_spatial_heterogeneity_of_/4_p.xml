<p class="p">Amongst non-urban land use changes, most change combinations will results in net SOC stock losses. Largest losses are recorded for conversions from grassland and forest into cropland, estimated under SRES scenario A1B at 44 Mton C (or 4.4 ± 1.6 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) and 10 Mton C (or 5.4 ± 1.4 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5</xref>). Most other land use change conversions are characterized by relatively small SOC changes with limited total stock losses (&lt;2 Mton C). The only land use changes that result in a net gain in total SOC stock are those associated with conversions of cropland or vineyard/orchard into forest or grassland. Under the SRES A1B scenario, cropland to grassland conversion results in a net SOC stock gain of 3.4 Mton C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>), which corresponds to a mean SOC gain of 0.7 ± 1.6 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that not all areas subject to this particular land use conversion demonstrate a net gain. The SOC change maps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>e–j) indicate that cropland to grassland conversion is most effective in storing C in the valleys in the central and northwest of France. These regions are characterized by relative low temperatures and have soils with relatively high clay contents (e.g. valley of the Seine river, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>e–j). This illustrates the important interaction between soil type and climate change in determining C sequestration potential at the national scale.
