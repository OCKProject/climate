<p class="p">In general, sandy regions (e.g. Vosges, Landes and Sologne) are typically characterized by rather high SOC losses. The important influence of soil type on the spatial heterogeneity in SOC changes becomes also very clear in the cropland dominated region in the south of France (i.e. north of the most central part of the Pyrenees) where high SOC losses occur in soils with low clay contents and low SOC losses are predicted for soils with high clay contents. Furthermore, areas with limited SOC stock gains are stony forested soils in the Mediterranean region (
