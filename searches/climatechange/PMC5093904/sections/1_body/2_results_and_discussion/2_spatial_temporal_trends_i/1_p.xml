<p class="p">The land use and ARPEGE-model derived climate variable distributions used for the SOC predictions are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> (a,b,c–j, respectively) for 1990 (baseline) and 2100. This shows that the urban sprawl will be the most important land use change process (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>a,b). The ARPEGE-model predicted temperature maps for 1990 shows that most areas have annual average temperatures below 11 °C while by 2100 most areas will have annual average temperatures above 11 °C under the SRES B1 scenario, above 12 °C under the SRES A1B scenario and above 13 °C for A2 scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>c–f). Annual precipitation maps indicate a general trend of drying with most areas witnessing a reduction of 100 mm year
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under SRES scenarios B1 and almost 200 mm y
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> under SRES scenarios A1B and A2. The predicted precipitation changes are much more pronounced in the mountainous regions than elsewhere, with absolute difference in rainfall up to 500 mm y
