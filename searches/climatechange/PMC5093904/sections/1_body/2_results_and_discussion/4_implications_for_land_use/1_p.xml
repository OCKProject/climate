<p class="p">Previous research has suggested that land use change within Europe could make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation by creating an important net SOC sink

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. Nevertheless, the latter studies have explored the effect of widespread land use change unconstrained by local decision-making. Here we model high-resolution business-as-usual land use change based on local decisions made in the recent past and, under these conditions, we observe contrasting results. We find that the land use change conversions result in a small net soil C loss, while climate change results in a large C loss and hence will have a dominant effect on SOC stock dynamics in mineral, mid-latitude soils in the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Although the conversion of urban areas into other land uses seems to be the most effective strategy to sequester C in the soil (i.e. resulting in net SOC stock gains between 3 and 8 kg C m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>) it is not expected that there is much scope for large soil C storage here, in particular because this study shows that under a business-as-usual land use scenario urban sprawl will be the most frequent land use change during the 21st century. Moreover, as a consequence of the lack of organic matter, nutrients and stable aggregates or the potential to be polluted, it most likely will take a rather long period before soils subject to de-urbanisation will act as sustainable sinks of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Besides de-urbanisation, only the conversions of cropland or vineyards into forest or grassland are predicted to result in a net soil C stock gain. Their potential to act as important soil C sinks is, however, strongly limited due to the small net SOC stock gains per unit area and/or the restricted land surface area that can be subject to these land use conversions.
