<p class="p">Due to the small SOC stock gain per unit area when converting cropland to grassland or forest (i.e. only 0.5–1 kg C m

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of cropland into grassland or forest would be required to offset 10% of the climate change induced loss of SOC from areas of unchanged land use. This is unrealistic as the total area of cropland in France in 1990 was only 228,000 km

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>)), but the net total SOC stock storage potential at the national scale is small due to the restricted land surface area of vineyard/orchards. So even converting all the existing vineyards/orchards into forest, will only lead to a net sequestration of 50 Mton C, which is only 5% of the total estimated SOC stock loss. Such a change is even less probable, given the economic and cultural importance of the vineyards in France.
