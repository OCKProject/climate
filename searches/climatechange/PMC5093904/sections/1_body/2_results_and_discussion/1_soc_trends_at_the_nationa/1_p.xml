<p class="p">Our high-resolution simulation of land use and climate change impacts on SOC stocks indicates that France will lose between 774 and 1221 Mton of SOC by 2100 (i.e. 20–30% of 1990 stock or from ca. 4,000 to 3,000 Mton C) (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). More precisely, the mean SOC decrease is 1,036 ± 164 Mton C or 25.7 ± 3.9%, which corresponds with an annual decrease of circa 10 Mton C y

The most important finding of this study is that future climate change will contribute approximately 10 times more to this total SOC decrease than land use change, i.e. 966 ± 168 Mton C or 23.9 ± 4.0% for climate change versus 97.4 ± 3.7 Mton C or 2.4 ± 0.1% for land use change, respectively. We will focus in this paper on outputs of the ARPEGE model SRES scenarios B1, A1B and A2, characterized by relative SOC losses of 19.6%, 26.8% and 30.1% between 1990 and 2100 (indicated in colour in

If the latter factor seems to act nevertheless as a significant negative feedback mechanism on SOC storage losses, the 21th century’s SOC losses across France may be smaller than the figures predicted in this study.
