<p class="p">In order to capture the potential interacting effects of future climate and land use change on SOC it is necessary to simulate these changes at a spatial resolution that captures physiographically-determined variation in soil properties. This demands high-resolution simulation of both climate and land use change. Hence, in the present study spatially detailed predictions of future evolution of SOC stocks driven by climate and land use change for France up to the year 2100 were produced by combining (i) an existing model, predicting SOC in the top 30 cm as a function of soil type, climate, land use and management
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>, with (ii) a business-as-usual land use change scenario and (iii) eight different spatially explicit climate change scenarios. In the business-as-usual land use change scenario, land use change trends between urban, cropland, grassland, forest and vineyard/orchard, observed by comparing 1990 and 2000 CORINE databases at a resolution of 250 meters, were extrapolated in time-steps of 10 years up to 2100. For these 5 land uses, probability maps were made by running logistic regressions considering a large set of physical and socio-economic factors and calibrated for each of the 22 administrative regions in France individually. The probability land use maps were used as input maps by applying a multi-objective land allocation (MOLA) procedure. The 8 spatially detailed climate change scenarios used in this study were obtained after applying a weather-type based statistical downscaling of large scale climate models considering three “Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Emissions Scenarios” (SRES) scenarios. More methodological details and/or results regarding the land use and climate input data produced in the context of this study can be found in the methods section.
