Our sub-sample comprised 6674 respondents (mean age 52.48 years, s.d. 14.45) who completed a module on climate change. Participants included 3705 (55.51%) women and 2799 (41.94%) men; 170 (2.55%) did not specify a gender. Most people (58%) were living in regional towns or cities, significantly more women (65%) than men (48%); the rest were living mainly on rural properties (30% women and 49% men). Consistent with the rural focus of the dataset, only 3% (197 respondents) were living in capital cities.
