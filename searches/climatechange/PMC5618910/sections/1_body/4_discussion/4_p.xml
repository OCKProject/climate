<p class="p">The expansion of services to help the minority of people who have psychiatric disorders and vulnerabilities ‘overcome stress, worry, and despair’ in relation to climate change (Swim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) may be a consideration, but this is not a priority for population mental health policy. Frightening people, especially those who are affected by disorders, would be irresponsible and unhelpful. The mental health workforce and those who train it have moral and practical responsibilities in advocacy for ill and vulnerable individuals and their foreseeable service needs (Maughan 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). But it is essential to differentiate between rational, manageable concern about climate change and pathological anxiety (Swim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). The present findings provide preliminary empirical corroboration that the two are not the same. Violent storms destroying houses may traumatise people and prolonged drought may cause widespread distress, but respectful, calm, considered public debate about how to respond to climate change will not.
