<p class="p">While cross-sectional studies cannot address causality, it is unlikely that worrying about climate change would substantially cause people to become poorly educated, married or resident on farms. Conversely, it makes sense to propose that believing human activity is causing (potentially disastrous) global warming would engender worry; and that certain predisposing factors might influence, in complex ways (Doherty &amp; Clayton, 
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>), the likelihood of believing this. This view is consistent with emerging evidence that climate change attitudes reflect social (rather than individual) context, such as politics, economics (Capstick 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), norms, social identity and general public uncertainty about the science itself; and that these constrain adaptation options. We must therefore look to relevant theories to explain these beliefs. There is thus value, as a starting point, in thinking systemically about societyâ€™s major relevant social and technological processes (Doherty &amp; Clayton, 
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) and about barriers to climate change adaptation (Swim 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>, 
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) to guide realistic mental health strategies relating to climate change.
