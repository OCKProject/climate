<p class="p">Most of the citrus germplasm results from interspecific hybridization and is highly heterozygous (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Curk et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, genetic mapping studies and QTL analysis are mainly based in a two-way pseudo-test cross-mapping strategy, from controlled hybridization between two heterozygous parents, and producing genetic maps for each parent (
