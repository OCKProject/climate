<p class="p">Recent advances in genomics are expected to greatly improve the efficiency of plant breeding for the intensification of agriculture under environmental constraints, thus increasing resilience of crops to climate change (

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brozynska et al., 2016</xref>). For the three woody crop species included in this review: grapevine, citrus and olive, rich germplasm collections exist, including commercial varieties and wild relatives (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arroyo-Garcia et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krueger and Navarro, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B232" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sebastiani and Busconi, 2017</xref>). Moreover, these three species have already been sequenced, further expanding the possibilities for the identification of candidate tolerance genes and contributing to bridge genotype and phenotype for adaptation traits.
