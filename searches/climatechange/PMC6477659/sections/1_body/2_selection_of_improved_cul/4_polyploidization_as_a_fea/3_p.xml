<p class="p">Spontaneous doubled-diploid genotypes (chromosome set duplication) occur in seedlings of apomictic citrus (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Aleza et al., 2011</xref>). They show several interesting features that can be exploited in plant breeding for abiotic stress tolerance. For instance, when subjected to drought, they show better acclimation traits than the respective diploid linked to a more limited transpiration and the maintenance of higher leaf water content (
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Oliveira et al., 2017</xref>), while a specific root architecture with reduced ramification, shorter root diameter with higher specific length at the morphological level has been linked to increased radial hydraulic conductivities (Lp
 <sub class="sub">r</sub>). This influences whole plant water status as well as plant growth and development, contributing to the enhanced tolerance to water deprivation (
