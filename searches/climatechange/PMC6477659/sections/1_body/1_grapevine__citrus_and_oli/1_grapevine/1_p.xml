<p class="p">The grapevine (
 <italic class="italic">Vitis vinifera</italic>) belongs to the family Vitaceae. The 
 <italic class="italic">Vitis</italic> genus includes about 60 species distributed in Europe, North America, and Asia under temperate Mediterranean and subtropical climatic conditions. 
 <italic class="italic">Vitis</italic> is separated in two subgenera, 
 <italic class="italic">Euvitis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Muscadinia</italic> characterized by different chromosome number (2
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 38 and 2
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 40, respectively). Sexual compatibility is wide within each subgenus but most of the inter-sub-generic hybrids are sterile. Nearly all grape cultivars produced for fruit, juice and wine are classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Vitis vinifera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">vinifera</italic> (or 
 <italic class="italic">sativa</italic>) or are hybrids of 
 <italic class="italic">V. vinifera</italic>. Current knowledge points toward its domestication from the wild relative of the same species: 
 <italic class="italic">Vitis vinifera</italic> L. subsp. 
 <italic class="italic">sylvestris</italic> (Gmelin) Hegi (

 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mihaljević et al., 2013</xref>). Other 
 <italic class="italic">Euvitis</italic> species such as 
 <italic class="italic">V. rupestris</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">V. riparia</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">V. berlandieri</italic> exhibit significant resistance to Phylloxera, Oidium, and mildews and are used primarily for rootstock breeding. It is believed that the domestication of grapevine originated in a region located between Black Sea and Iran 6,000–9,000 years ago (
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Myles et al., 2011</xref>). From this spot, it spread toward Middle East and Central Europe which are nowadays considered secondary domestication centers resulting from gene flow between wild and cultivated gene pools (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bouby et al., 2013</xref>). In the Mediterranean Basin, grape spread gradually westwards (
 <xref rid="B247" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Terral et al., 2010</xref>), with the most ancient evidence of viticulture found in Greece and Crete (fifth millennium BC), then in Italy (ninth century BC) and Spain (early within the last millennium BC). The French viticulture appears to be more recent (600 years BC).
