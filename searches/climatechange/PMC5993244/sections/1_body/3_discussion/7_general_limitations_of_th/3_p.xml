<p class="p">There are also limits concerning the bio‐physical models' ability to represent extreme weather events. Increased frequency and intensity of extreme heat, drought or heavy rains will doubtlessly undermine future yield production. For example, heat can cause water stress by increased atmospheric water demand and depletion of soil water as well as it can directly damage plant tissues, impair flowering, trigger oxidative stress or lower net photosynthesis rates (Schauberger et al.,

 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) projected a robust increase in heavy precipitation events everywhere except Southern Europe in summer, with amplitudes in the range 0%–20%. However, EPIC, as other crop models, fails to capture the negative impacts of heavy rain and extremely wet conditions. Long‐term impacts presented in this study should be less sensitive to such models' deficiencies with respect to the extreme weather events though.
