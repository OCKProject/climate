<p class="p">Irrigation availability will doubtlessly determine future yields in dry zones of Southern and Pannonian Europe (Section 3.5). Expansion of irrigation on rainfed cropland under scenario P2 and intensification of the existing irrigation systems under scenario P1 bracket large projection uncertainties in these regions (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). However, even when targeting at 80% of the potential productivity, the net irrigation requirement would about double on currently irrigated cropland compared to today, and approximately the same quantity would be needed on vast areas of currently rainfed cropland in case of irrigation expansion (Figure S8b in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Out of the options evaluated here, water availability will therefore be the key factor for future intensification. Probably due to concerns about future water scarcity (Elliott et al.,

 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) large irrigation expansion for food crops is not expected by farmers in very dry zones (Olesen et al.,
