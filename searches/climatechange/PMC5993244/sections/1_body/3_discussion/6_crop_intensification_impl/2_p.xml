<p class="p">Large yield potentials (scenario P1 and P2, Section 3.5) suggest that possible future intensification of fertilization and irrigation may represent a substantial uncertainty for projected calorie yields at +2°C (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). Looking back, we learn that crop intensification was undoubtedly among main drivers of yield increase in the past. For example, wheat yields in Europe have nearly tripled since 1960 because of intensification and improved crop management (Ewert et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). However, regardless of the untapped future potential, major changes toward more intensive fertilization are foreseen only by farmers in the northernmost regions and, to a lesser extent, in continental and Pannonia zones (Olesen et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In fact, more intensive fertilization is not a policy option for Central and Western European croplands because of serious pollution of ground and surface waters in many watersheds and aquifers. Besides, assuming that a maximum approximately 80% of the yield potential can be utilized by farmers (Lobell et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; van Ittersum et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), the BAU fertilization already provides sufficient supply to capitalize from +2°C in most of Western and Northern Europe, except for the Baltics. Improved fertilizer use efficiency in particular of organic fertilizers together with other technological developments and breeding are likely options in those high‐intensity regions in order to comply with the EU environmental policies (Levers et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In Eastern and South‐Eastern Europe, though, increased fertilizer application is likely required to take the advantage of the +2°C warming. Increasing trends in fertilizer application rates are already reality in some countries, such as Czechia or Poland (Levers et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Sutton, 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Future development will strongly depend on economic and political boundary conditions, including agricultural and environmental policies in the EU.
