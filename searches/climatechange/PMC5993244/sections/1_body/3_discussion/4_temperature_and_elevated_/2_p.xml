<p class="p">Our simulations suggest that direct fertilization effect of rising CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has the potential to overcompensate negative effects of increased temperature in irrigated and high‐rainfall systems as well as in some water‐limited systems in EU (Section 3.2). The overcompensation is sufficiently robust across the whole range of UA for high‐input systems in Western Europe (Belgium), but it can be undermined by synergic interactions of soil degradation and insufficient fertilization (e.g., Lithuania in Section 3.4). The reliability of our projections thus critically depends on EPIC's ability to simulate crop yields response to increased temperature and elevated CO

 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) raised concern that biophysical models including EPIC may overestimate (by ∼50%) the direct CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects, which was later disputed (Ewert et al.,

 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref> demonstrates, in a generic way, how the most important crops (C

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> maize) respond to temperature increase and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in our pan‐EU EPIC, allowing comparison to published outcomes. In summary, our results agree fairly well with temperature and elevated CO
