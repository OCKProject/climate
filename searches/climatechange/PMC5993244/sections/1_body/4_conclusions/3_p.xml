<p class="p">The positive impact is mostly stimulated by (1) CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect and (2) improved growing season temperatures for summer crops in Northern Europe and in higher altitudes. The projections suggest that 100–200 ppm more CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the atmosphere under +2°C compared to the baseline will overcompensate otherwise mostly negative, or only a slightly positive, effects of warming in temperature limited (high‐rainfall and irrigated) systems as well as in some water‐limited environments in Europe (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). There are some caveats concerning the fertilization effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. For example, the impacts on temperature‐limited systems would be considerably smaller, but still mostly positive, when only approximately 50% efficiency of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization is considered (roughly halfway between the circles in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a): about 10% or less in most countries of Western, Northern, and Eastern Europe. The impacts on water‐limited systems of Southern and South‐Eastern Europe will be even more uncertain, varying between slightly negative and positive. A possible overestimation in maize response to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in EPIC may contribute to lessening out the negative effects of warming, especially in Southern Europe.
