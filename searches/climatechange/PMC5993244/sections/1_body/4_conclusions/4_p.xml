<p class="p">Soil degradation in terms of SOM decrease could be a serious threat for European agriculture under +2Â°C warming. Potential yield losses of more than 20% in some Eastern European and Baltic regions may undermine the positive impact of elevated CO

At a country level, soil erosion contributed only little to the calorie yield vulnerability since severe erosion affected only a small fraction of cropland area. Nutrient status is more undermined by organic matter mineralization, nutrient leaching and loss from nitrogen export through harvested products. Agricultural systems with currently insufficient fertilization are especially vulnerable since they do not have the capacity to (1) overcompensate for losses due to nutrient depletion and (2) benefit from rising CO

 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>), the vulnerability analysis is burdened by a considerable uncertainty due to modeling of soil processes and crop management practices as quantified in Section 3.4. Nevertheless, this study is a pioneering attempt to address yield vulnerability to future soil degradation.
