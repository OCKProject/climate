 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, a robustly positive calorie yield change of 5%–20% under future +2°C scenarios was simulated for the EU except for some NUTS2 regions in Bulgaria, Romania, Portugal, Spain, Greece, and Italy (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Owing to inherent uncertainty in EURO‐CORDEX projections, the impact results are largely uncertain in these regions (form −10% up to 30% at 5th to 95th percentiles), and they are well below the acceptable threshold for robustness.
