<p class="p">We carried out a detailed analysis to quantify the contribution of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and projected seasonal temperature and precipitation patterns to the regional calorie yield changes summarized in Section 3.1. Irrigated BAU simulations were used to address irrigated and high‐rainfall cropland, while rainfed simulations from the areas dominated by water stress (water stress in &gt;50% days of the growing period) were used to disentangle the impacts of precipitation on water limited production (Figure
