<p class="p">Owing to an increase in seasonal temperature by approximately 13%, the irrigated and high‐rainfall calorie yields would increase by 1%–3% and 19%–23% with fixed and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, respectively, in Western Europe, but only by 13% in the latter case in France. Importantly, water‐limited yields in southern France decreased by 5% when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect is not considered. Yet, elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has the potential to offset the negative effects, leading to an overall increase by 4% (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). In general, maize and other summer crops would benefit from alleviated low temperature limitations in the wetter and cooler parts of Western Europe, while winter crops and tubers will benefit from elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Winter cereals would be affected negatively without elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (Text S2, also Figure S2 and S10 in
