<p class="p">Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and seasonal temperature are two dominant climatic factors determining yield changes in Northern Europe. A robust increase in seasonal temperature sum (10%–40%) resulted in calorie yield changes ranging from −8% in Lithuania to +7% in Ireland when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was fixed at 360 ppm, while a consistently positive calorie yield change of +13% to +25% was simulated with elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (circles in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). The positive impact is composed of (1) a strong fertilization effect of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on winter crops, which would be affected rather negatively if CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> remained constant (Text S2, also Figure S2 and S10 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>) and (2) more favorable temperature conditions for summer and root crops, allowing them to be more viable on cropland farther north. For example, the mean sunflower yield achieved in Europe around the year 2000 (about 2 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) would be exceeded on more than 50% of existing cropland, except for the far north areas of Finland (data not shown). Changes in precipitation alone do not affect our yield projections since crops are not critically limited by water deficit. However, &gt;10% increase in rainfall during the long growing seasons affected the yields negatively via reduced solar radiation, leading to the weak response of yields to increased temperature in the north (
