 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). A approximately 13% temperature increase in the growing period, together with elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> of up to 470–580 ppm at +2°C, stimulated the calorie yields by about 17%–21% in Czechia, Poland, and Slovakia, and by 9%–12% in Hungary, Bulgaria, and Romania. The impact is much weaker at fixed CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels though: from −1% to +4% on the country average, while a positive yield response is in most cases visible only at higher warming rates simulated for the montane climate (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). In general, the yield change is dominated by higher productivity of summer crops and tubers under elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Figure S2 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). A benefit from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization could more or less offset the losses in winter cereal yields expected due to shortening of the growing period (Text S2 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Water‐limited calories production in the driest Pannonian lowlands of Hungary, Bulgaria, and especially Romania, is sensitive to the altered precipitation patterns (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). For example, in Romania, a 10% increase in growing season precipitation may lead to 8% gain in crop calories productivity despite the increase in daily rainfall amounts (Figure S12 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Dryland areas would also significantly benefit from elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, potentially offsetting the yield losses corresponding to a precipitation decrease by approximately 5% in Bulgaria and Romania dryland. Projected changes in seasonal temperature and precipitation alone resulted in calories change from −6% to +1%, but from +4% to +13% when combined with elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b).
