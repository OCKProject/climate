<p class="p">In Southern Europe, calories from well‐watered crops demonstrate a significant linear relationship with changes in seasonal temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). A 10%–15% temperature raise stimulated calorie yields by 5%–14% when supplemented by an additional 100–200 ppm of atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> compared to the baseline, while the impact was negative to slightly positive (−4% to +2%) under the present‐day CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Water‐limited calorie yields are significantly sensitive to precipitation changes together with elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Portugal (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>‐test 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001 for all regressions). In dryland areas, calorie yields would be impacted mostly negatively at the present‐day CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels. Yet, elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may offset these losses due to fertilization effect on C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> crops, and increased crop water use efficiency (Figure S2, also Text S2 and Figure S10 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). The estimates in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b indicate that elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may potentially offset calorie losses corresponding to a precipitation decrease by approximately 10% in the Mediterranean dryland.
