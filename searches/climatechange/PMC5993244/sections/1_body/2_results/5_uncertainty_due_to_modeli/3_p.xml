<p class="p">A decrease in crop calories simulated for Lithuania in Section 3.3 is robust across the whole range of UA‐
 <italic class="italic">dyn</italic>. The mean country‐level yield declined between −30 and −65 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> relative to the historic period. This is mainly due to decreasing root and winter crop productivity under the degradation 
 <italic class="italic">dyn</italic> scenario, while summer crops were positively impacted (Figure S7 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). A similar though more uncertain effect of +10 to −60 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was estimated for Slovakia, owing to very heterogeneous terrain and soils. Uncertainty in soil degradation vulnerability, which is the difference between UA‐
 <italic class="italic">con</italic> and UA‐
 <italic class="italic">dyn</italic> in the +2°C period relative to the respective historic period, is substantial for all analyzed countries, but the UA‐mean values are in a good agreement with the BAU projections used in Section 3.3 (green and blue lines in Figure
