<p class="p">Importantly, at the scale of our study, avoiding conservation practices from the soil degradation scenario used in the vulnerability analysis (Section 3.3) does not undermine conclusions driven for the +2°C period as the differences between BAU‐
 <italic class="italic">dyn</italic> and conservation UA‐
 <italic class="italic">dyn</italic> scenarios are marginal there (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, “Till effect” panel). In general, historical yields under emulated conservation practices are on average 85%–95% of conventional yields, and in Belgium it remains similar also in the future. The relative loss is higher in cooler regions of Lithuania and parts of Slovakia, while almost equal though less variable calorie yields are estimated in Portugal. Yields in the conventional scenario (blue line) decline faster compared to the conservation scenario (purple line) in Slovakia and Lithuania, suggesting that soil conservation slows down the decline in yields by mitigating soil degradation effects.
