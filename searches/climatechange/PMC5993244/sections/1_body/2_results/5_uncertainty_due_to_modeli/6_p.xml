<p class="p">In summary, elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> overcompensated the negative impacts of local +2°C warming across the whole range of UA in Lithuania and to a lesser extent in other analyzed countries under the no‐degradation scenario (C + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> versus C–CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c). Soil degradation (D + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) robustly decreased the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐induced yield gain in Belgium, or even reverse the impact sign in most cases in Lithuania, Slovakia, and Portugal. Unlike in Belgium, the contribution of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is only marginal under the degradation scenario in Lithuania, Slovakia, and Portugal where yields are dominated by nutrient limitations, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> cannot compensate for the combined effect of warming and degradation (D + CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and D–CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c). In the degradation scenario, conservation practices (Dc in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>c) reduced the country‐mean yield losses, especially in Lithuania, and reduced UA ranges in all analyzed countries under both CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenarios.
