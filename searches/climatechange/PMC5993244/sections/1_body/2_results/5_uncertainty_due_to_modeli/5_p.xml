 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Belgium, where crops largely benefit from direct CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect due to ample fertilization and high precipitation. This is not the case in Slovakia, Portugal, and Lithuania though, where simulated yields are to a great extent limited by nutrient or water deficiency, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>‐induced yield gain is lower (∼20 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) under no degradation, and there is no effect in the degradation scenario (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a, “CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect” panel). With atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fixed at 360 ppm, rising temperature would have a negative effect on simulated mean calorie yield in all analyzed countries except for a small stimulus of mild warming up to 1.5°C in Slovakia (dashed boxes in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). The temperature‐related impact uncertainty is considerably large due to site heterogeneity, particularly in Portugal and Slovakia: from −80 to +50 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and −45 to +35 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively, when +2°C of regional warming is considered. Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (490–605 ppm in the +2°C period) significantly increased calorie yields in all countries and warming intervals (Δ
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>) compared to constant CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> scenario (paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>‐test 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001). Importantly, the growth increment due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> elevated by approximately 200 ppm offset temperature increase of +2°C in Belgium, Lithuania, and Portugal, and even a higher warming in Slovakia (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). The cooler regions in higher altitudes demonstrate larger yield increases along the temperature gradient (data not shown), contributing largely to the overall yield uncertainty in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b.
