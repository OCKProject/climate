<p class="p">At the national level, an increase by 17–38 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was estimated for Western European countries, that is, countries which currently belong to the most productive in Europe. The lowest but still robustly estimated positive impact was approximately 6% as projected for south‐western France (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). There is a large yield impact range projected in France, ranging from −2% to +40% in the south‐western regions. In general, the ranges in yield projections are larger in regions with cooler montane climate. Maize and other summer crop yields except for sugar beet would increase the most, especially in higher altitudes. Owing to its long growing season, sugar beet tends to be negatively though not robustly affected in various parts of Western Europe (Figure S1 and Table S2 in
