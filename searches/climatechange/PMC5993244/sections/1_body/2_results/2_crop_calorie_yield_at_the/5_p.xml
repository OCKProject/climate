<p class="p">In the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, at the national average, a small overall increase of 6–13 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was calculated, while for the other Eastern European countries a moderate gain of 17–27 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was estimated. The climate change impacts are largely uncertain across EURO‐CORDEX scenarios and the yield change projections are therefore insufficiently robust in many NUTS2 regions in Romania and Bulgaria (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The projected yields range from −10% to +25%, and from −5% to +20% in regions of Bulgaria and Romania, respectively. Despite the positive overall impact demonstrated in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, all crops experienced a decrease in yields in at least some simulated climate change scenarios in these regions (Figure S1 in
