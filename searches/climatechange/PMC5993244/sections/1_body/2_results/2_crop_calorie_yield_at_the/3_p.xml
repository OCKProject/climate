<p class="p">The most positive relative impact with robustness above 90% was simulated over Northern Europe, with a lower impact magnitude in the Baltic countries. The aggregated calorie yield is expected to increase by more than 17% (20–34 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in Denmark, Ireland, United Kingdom and Finland, and by 12% (15 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in the Baltics. The climate projection‐related yield impact uncertainty ranges from +6% to +20% in regions of the Baltic countries, and from +7% to +30% in other regions in the north (Figure
