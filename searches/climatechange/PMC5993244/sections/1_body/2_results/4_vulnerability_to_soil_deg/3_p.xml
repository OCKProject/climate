<p class="p">Due to low level of fertilization, yield vulnerability at +2°C is largely driven by decreasing soil organic matter in the Baltic states and Eastern Europe (Figure S5 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). For example, simulated carbon stock decreased by 15%–20% in the Baltics and by 8%–14% in eastern countries when KNMI projection is considered. Country‐level median erosion rates calculated from all cropland were below 1 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in all EU states, except for Ireland, Slovenia, and Luxembourg, leading to an annual carbon loss ranging between 6 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Denmark and 120 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Slovenia (Table S6 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). Losses of more than 100 t ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in extreme years were simulated especially in the Mediterranean countries (see 99th percentiles in Table S6 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). However, erosion contributed only little to the national yield vulnerability under +2°C. As demonstrated in Figure S6 in
