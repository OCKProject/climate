<p class="p">Eastern and some Northern EU countries will be especially vulnerable if crops continued to be managed with BAU input intensity, since the current inputs do not provide the capacity to overcompensate for future degradation‐induced nutrient losses. In Eastern Europe apart from Czechia, the vulnerability ranged between 21 and 32 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Romania and Hungary (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), respectively, while the highest relative loss (&gt;20%) was estimated in parts of Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, and Slovakia (Figure S4 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). The uncertainty range across individual climate projection is presented in Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. With current fertilization at 40%–50% of the intensity needed for crops growing without nutrient stress (Figure S3a in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>), nutrient inputs would not sufficiently compensate for weakening soil fertility under +2°C. An even higher vulnerability of above 40 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> was simulated for the Baltic states with soil carbon loss due to warmer climate (Figure S5 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>) amplifying insufficient nutrient supply under the BAU scenario (fertilization &lt;40% of the intensity under P1). The fraction of calories in Eastern European and the Baltic countries vulnerable to losses due to soil degradation is in most cases higher than the calorie yield gain due to climate change (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Moreover, in Bulgaria and Romania, caloric yield vulnerability is over 40% higher when irrigated systems alone are considered (Figure 
 <xref rid="eft2292-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Therefore, soil degradation may negatively outweigh positive impacts of +2°C when not prevented by adaptation measures. Western European states are generally less vulnerable as they have more capacity to overcompensate soil degradation effects via sufficient fertilizer supply. Current N‐fertilization intensities are at 60% to 140% of the quantity required for unstressed plant growth, offsetting harmful effects of nutrient losses on degraded soils. Consequently yield vulnerability only seldom exceeded 10% (Figure S4 in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). In Southern Europe, rainfed systems would be little to moderately susceptible to soil degradation since the yield would be predominantly controlled by water deficit during the growing season (e.g., most of Spain and Greece).
