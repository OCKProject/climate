Particularly large ranges were estimated in France due to irrigation intensification (P1) and expansion (P2) adaptations: almost 60% in the latter scenario. However, compensation for water stress in order to approach the P1 productivity on currently irrigated cropland would require about 100 mm (10–200 mm) of net irrigation annually when averaged across all winter and spring crops (except for rice), which is about two times more than water demand simulated for the present days under BAU management (Figure S8b in
