<p class="p">A considerable uncertainty along the crop intensification gradient is estimated also in Eastern Europe: 47–78 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 70–182 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for scenarios P1 and P2, respectively. Approaching the P1 and P2 yields would require a substantial increase in fertilizer inputs particularly in Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary compared to today (Figure S8a in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>). In addition, future irrigation capacity contributes significantly to the overall uncertainty in the Pannonian basin. A much smaller yield difference between BAU and P1 (60–80 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) compared to P2 (130–180 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) points to a large uncertainty due to possible expansion of irrigated cropland. However, high net annual irrigation water requirement of 140–200 mm crop
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> on average, and more than 250 mm crop
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in some regions (Figure S8b in 
 <xref rid="eft2292-supitem-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">Supporting Information S1</xref>) would render irrigation expansion challenging.
