<p class="p">Extrapolation of BAU crop fertilization and irrigation management toward the time period of the +2°C threshold represents a considerable source of uncertainty. In this analysis, we used the calorie yields theoretically achievable in high‐input agricultural systems under scenarios P1 and P2 to bracket this uncertainty. Mean ranges between the BAU projections and the respective high‐input system yields are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>. In general, the yield differences between high‐input scenario P1 and BAU are about 2 (e.g., Belgium and Netherlands) to 50 (Portugal) times higher than the projected climate impacts presented in Section 3.1, indicating that crop intensification has the potential to greatly boost the benefits from climate change in most of Europe as well as outweigh possible negative effect in the south (not taking into account resource constraints).
