<p class="p">Possible expansion and intensification of irrigated cropland represents a large projection uncertainty also in Southern Europe, mainly in Spain, Greece, Portugal, and Italy. Many regions demonstrate only a limited response to management intensification if currently irrigated cropland is not expanded under P1: 60 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Spain and Greece, and about 80–100 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in Italy, Portugal, and Slovenia. With expansion of irrigated cropland under P2 though, the calorie production under +2°C may exceed 300 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, corresponding to a substantial production uncertainty of more than 200 Gcal ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in many regions (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). However, approaching this hypothetical productivity would mean a net annual irrigation requirement of more than 250 mm crop
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (160 mm in Italy and 60 mm in Slovenia) on almost all available cropland (Figure S8b in
