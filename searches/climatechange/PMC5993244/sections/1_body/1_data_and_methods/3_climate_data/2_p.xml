<p class="p">A regional ensemble of bias‐corrected EURO‐CORDEX climate change simulations (Jacob et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) developed in the Quantifying Projected Impacts Under 2°C Warming project (IMPACT2C,

In our study, the projections meet the +2°C threshold when their driving global climate models reach the +2°C threshold globally. This threshold is reached when the 30‐year running mean temperature calculated from the base period 1971–2000, plus the observed preindustrial warming before this period, exceeds the +2°C threshold (Vautard et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Accordingly, 30‐year periods around the year when the +2°C warming was reached and the base period of 1971–2000 were evaluated throughout the paper. A total of five moderate emission RCP 4.5 projections were used (Table 
 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) since most of the low emission RCP2.6 simulations in EURO‐CORDEX do not reach +2°C at all and the high emission RCP 8.5 scenarios are not compatible with the +2°C mitigation target. Given the selected RCP 4.5 projections and periods when the +2°C threshold is reached, atmospheric CO
