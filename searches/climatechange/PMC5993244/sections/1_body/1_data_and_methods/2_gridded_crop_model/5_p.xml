<p class="p">Ten major European crops, namely winter wheat, winter rye, spring barley, grain maize, rice, winter rapeseed, soy bean, sunflower, sugar beet and potatoes, were simulated for 25 Member States of the EU. We excluded Malta, Cyprus, and Croatia from the analysis due to lack of input data. Regional differences in crop varieties characterized by different growth period lengths follow the climatic stratification in the EU as described by Balkovič et al. (
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Planting and harvesting dates were scheduled automatically based on heat unit accumulation, while potential heat unit requirements (PHU) were constant during the course of the simulation. Automatic harvest was scheduled at 110% (cereals and potatoes) and 115% (grain maize, rapeseed, sunflower and soy bean) of the PHU to enable flexible harvesting and to take postmaturity drying of crops on the field into account. All crops were simulated in mono‐crop rotations on all the available cropland. Crop rotations and present‐day harvested areas were not included since this information is generally lacking at the target resolution and this pattern may change in the future. Rice was simulated only in Bulgaria, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Romania, and Spain. Although EPIC's ability to simulate historical yields was extensively validated for some crops by Balkovič et al. (
