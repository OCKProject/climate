The potential daily increase is adjusted to an actual biomass increase if the potential demand for water or nutrients exceeded actually available supply, or the temperature goes beyond the optimal range. The root growth is constrained by soil strength or aluminum toxicity. Plant phenological development, including leaf growth, plant nutrients concentration, partitioning of biomass among roots and shoots as well as yield formation are defined by heat units (in °C) accumulated over the growing season. Since soils are storing, cycling and providing nutrients and water for crops in EPIC, dynamic soil processes ranging from soil hydrology to organic matter and nutrient cycles are simulated (Izaurralde et al.,

EPIC allows simulations with a static soil profile, when all soil properties except for plant‐available nutrients and water are reinitialized at the beginning of each year, or with a dynamic soil profile when soil properties are continuously simulated over time. EPIC's processes relevant for assessment of climate change impact on crops were summarized in the supplementary information of Folberth et al. (
