<p class="p">Crop management scenarios with ample nutrient and water supply (P1 and P2) were evaluated relative to the BAU scenario to bracket projected yield uncertainties related to the range of future intensification levels. The uncertainty range is expressed as a yield difference between the baseline BAU projection and the respective high‐input scenarios under +2°C. Crop intensification options other than more intensive irrigation and fertilization are not accounted for herein.</p>
