 <xref rid="eft2292-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) was used for the UA, being close to the ensemble median in terms of temperature change rate. All simulations described above were performed with constant (360 ppm) and transient atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (from 325 ppm in 1971 up to 700 ppm in 2100). The impact of temperature was analyzed by grouping all yield data simulated for the +2°C period into Δ

 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">T</styled-content> is relative to the mean annual temperature from 1971 to 2000. A more generic modeling experiment was carried out to provide an extended insight into the uncertainty due to incrementally increasing temperature and CO
