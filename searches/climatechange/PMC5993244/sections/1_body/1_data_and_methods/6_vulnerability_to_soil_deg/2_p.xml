<p class="p">Soil degradation is the decline in soil quality caused by degradation processes such as water and wind erosion, loss of soil organic matter, salinization, acidification, contamination, sealing, or compaction. In this study we address impacts of water erosion and adverse changes in soil organic matter and nutrient dynamics, including soil organic matter mineralization, nutrient leaching, and loss from export through harvested products, while other degradation processes are not accounted for.

Yield vulnerability (Vs) is quantified as a fraction of projected calorie yield that may be lost due to harmful effects of soil degradation. BAU fertilization and irrigation determine the capacity to stabilize yields on degraded soils.
