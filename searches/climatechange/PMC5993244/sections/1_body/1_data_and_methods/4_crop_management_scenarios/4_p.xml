<p class="p">All simulations were carried out assuming conventional tillage, consisting of two cultivation operations and moldboard plowing prior to sowing and an offset disking after harvesting of cereals. Two row cultivations during the growing season were assumed for maize and one ridging operation for potatoes. We assume that 20% of crop residues are removed in case of cereals (excluding maize), while no residues are harvested for other crops (Köble,
