<p class="p">All crop management scenarios were simulated with constant soil profiles (
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">con</styled-content>), where all soil variables other than readily available nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and soil water content were reinitialized each year and soil erosion was not considered. These simulations allow the assessment of climate change impacts independently from soil degradation. Besides simulations with constant soil profiles, dynamic soil profiles (
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">dyn</styled-content>) together with the BAU crop management scenario were used to account for future vulnerability to soil degradation (see Section 2.5). The
