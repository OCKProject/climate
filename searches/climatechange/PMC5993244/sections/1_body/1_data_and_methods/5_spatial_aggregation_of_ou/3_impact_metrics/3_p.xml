<p class="p">The impact robustness (
 <styled-content style="italic-in-any-context" class="styled-content">R</styled-content>) across climate projections was assessed as a fraction of EPIC realizations with a positive change in calorie yield with respect to the total number of realizations calculated for NUTS2 regions. Therefore, the robustness accounts for SimU‐level agreement in climate projections aggregated at NUTS2 level. In this study we assume that the impact is highly robust when
