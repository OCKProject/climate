<p class="p">First, we estimate, at a regional scale, the ranges and robustness of biophysical impacts on the combined crop‐derived calorie yield. Second, we disentangle the vulnerability to soil degradation in terms of soil loss, depletion of plant nutrients, and soil organic carbon since these are among the major threats to crop production, especially in regions with less‐developed agricultural systems. Finally, we bracket projected calorie yield uncertainties related to (1) future crop intensification possibilities, (2) increased temperature and elevated CO
