<p class="p">In this study we quantify biophysical impact of global warming as high as +2°C on calorie supply from 10 major crops and its vulnerability to soil degradation in the European Union (EU) Member States. To our knowledge, such large‐scale analysis is still lacking despite a growing number of impact studies in the agricultural sector. An ensemble of the most recent regionally downscaled climate change projections from the European branch of the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO‐CORDEX) is used, together with the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) crop model, to capture inherent uncertainties due to climate simulation. The uncertainties due to EPIC crop modeling are quantified via an uncertainty analysis (UA) with varying model assumptions and parameters.</p>
