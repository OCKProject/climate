<p class="p">Climate change and soil degradation are among the major threats to agriculture and food security (Lal et al.,

 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Following the Paris climate agreement, 193 nations have committed to keep the global average warming well below 2째C relative to preindustrial temperatures and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5째C. Recent climate projections indicate that Europe will warm at a faster rate than the global average, and a +2째C of global warming will bring a significantly changed climate to Europe (Vautard et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, Northern and Eastern Europe in winter and Southern Europe in summer will likely experience warming up to +3째C, with an increase in winter precipitation in Central Europe and an overall increase of precipitation over Northern Europe. The trends and amplified weather variability characterizing this future climate will bring challenges to Europe, one of the largest producers of agricultural goods.
