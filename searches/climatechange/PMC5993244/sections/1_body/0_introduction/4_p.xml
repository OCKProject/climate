<p class="p">An increasing number of studies describe climate change impacts on crops, but the impacts of soil degradation have received much less attention, even though combatting continuing degradation is of utmost importance (Bindraban et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Montanarella, 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Soil with a lowered capability to store and release water and nutrients can provide only little relief to crops coping with impacts from climate change. Indeed, healthy soils can help crops to cope better with increased climate variability (Tubiello et al., 
 <xref rid="eft2292-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Continuous cropping can deplete soil fertility due to inadequate replacement of nutrients harvested with produce or lost through leaching, erosion, and atmospheric emissions. Most of the processes responsible for soil degradation, including soil organic matter mineralization and erosion, are enhanced by higher temperature and more intense precipitation. It has been estimated that almost 40% of the total agricultural land in Europe is prone to soil degradation at a moderate or higher level of severity (Lal,
