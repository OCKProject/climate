   <p class="p">Histograms indicating comparisons of ten climatic variables among LIG, LGM and Present. The means of each variable was calculated based on 1506 occurrence records after spatial filtration at 5 km of all the combination records of 11 birds. The temperature data are in centigrade (°C) and precipitation is in millimeters (mm). The asterisk (*) indicates 
    <italic class="italic">P</italic> ≤ 0.001 calculated with a paired-samples T test. The results show larger seasonal climatic variability at the LIG than the LGM or the present, being warmer in summers (Bio_5), colder in winters (Bio_11), drier in dry seasons (Bio_14) and wetter in wet seasons (Bio_16).
