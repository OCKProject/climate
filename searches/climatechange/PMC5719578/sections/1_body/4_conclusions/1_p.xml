 </sub> at the LIG and then bounced back to a larger LGM range similar to the current one. The asynchronous range dynamics among organisms in different ecozones might have led to variable evolutionary consequences. For example, at the LGM temperate species might have retreated to isolated refugia facilitating population divergence and speciation [

Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of regional differences is critical to test historical biogeographic hypotheses globally.
