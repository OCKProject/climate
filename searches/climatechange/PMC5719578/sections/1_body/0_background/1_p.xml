<p id="Par11" class="p">Recent glacial cycles have been well recognized as one of the major forces shaping patterns of global biodiversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. It is widely perceived that species responded to the cyclical climatic changes in the Pleistocene by the repeated “expansion-contraction” of their ranges during the alternating glacial and interglacial periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. For example, advancing ice sheets in the Pleistocene drove the contraction of temperate biota to refugia and the expansion of polar biota in glaciated regions such as Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>], North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>] and Antarctica [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Conversely, in unglaciated regions increasing aridity due to global cooling during glacial maxima led to range contraction in mesic-adapted species and range expansion in arid-adapted species, as reported in South America and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] and Sundaland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. It has been argued that the alternative warmer and wetter climate during interglacial periods caused the range changes in these regions into the reverse [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. However, whether climate oscillations during the Pleistocene lead to cyclical range changes in the biota of East Asia, a biodiversity hotspot [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>], has not been comprehensively assessed.
