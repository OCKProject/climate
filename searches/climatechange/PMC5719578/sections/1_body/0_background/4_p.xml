 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], we first used ENM analyses to examine whether the birds’ habitats were subject to regular glacial contraction and interglacial expansion during the last glacial cycle (i.e. the LIG, LGM and present day). Range dynamics (expansion or contraction) resulting from climate change are expected to have had pronounced genetic consequences in populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. So we further performed coalescent analyses based on 25–30 nuclear loci for each species to examine whether the last glaciation cycle had impacted population genetic variation and demographic dynamics of the 11 East Asian birds.
