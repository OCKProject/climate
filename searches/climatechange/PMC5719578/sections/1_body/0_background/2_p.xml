<p id="Par12" class="p">East Asia was not covered by ice sheets during the entire Pleistocene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Palynological data indicate a southward contraction of subtropical vegetation at the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; 19–26 thousand years ago, Ka) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Despite confirmation by several ecological niche modeling (ENM) studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], other recent studies failed to find any significant impact of the LGM on the distributions of several plant and animal species in East Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]; rather, some studies observed substantial range contraction during the warmer Last Interglacial period (LIG, ~112–132 Ka) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Given that severe range retraction can cause dramatic reductions in population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], one might expect small effective population sizes (

 </sub>) in East Asian species because of either LGM or LIG contraction. By contrast, several genetic analyses found confounding effects, e.g. with demographic growth under a range contraction scenario [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] or with constant population size through Pleistocene glaciations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. Thus, it was hypothesized that Pleistocene glaciations might have had a minor impact on East Asian organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. However, such discrepancies may have been caused by limitations in study design, for example, with low power to detect population decline (e.g. bottleneck) based on limited number of loci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>], such as a single maternally inherited locus (e.g. mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>] or few, if any, nuclear genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. In addition, previous studies only focused on one or few species precluding a comprehensive understanding of community level dynamics. Therefore, analyses based on multiple species and multiple loci are required to robustly test for demographic dynamics of biota in this region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>].
