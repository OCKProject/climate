<p id="Par27" class="p">The response pattern suggested by our present study stands in contrast to the prevailing view of cyclical range shifts for temperate species, which postulates glacial contraction and post-glacial expansion. These results also contradict the palynological analysis suggesting an LGM contraction in East Asia. The power of palynological reconstructions might be compromised by the scarcity of pollen-fossil data, a problem prevalent in unglaciated regions in the Pleistocene [
