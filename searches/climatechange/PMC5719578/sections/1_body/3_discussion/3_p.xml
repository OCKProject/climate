<p id="Par28" class="p">The LIG has long been recognized as a climatic optimum for most mesic-adapted species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>], and fossil records suggest similar avifaunas between the LIG and the current interglacial period in temperate regions of Europe and North America [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. However, our analyses revealed species’ range and demographic contraction at this time, suggesting that the East Asian climate at the LIG had some significant evolutionary consequences. Climate summary statistics showed larger seasonal climatic variability at the LIG than the LGM or present (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a and b</xref>), which increased with latitude in this region at the LIG (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>: Figure S3). This climatic scenario is consistent with results from recent simulation studies of LIG climate based on orbit parameters, which also showed that the larger temperature seasonality over East Asia during LIG might have resulted from seasonal fluctuations in incoming solar radiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. Given the nature of the limited tolerance of subtropical species to climatic variations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>], the increased LIG climate seasonality at higher latitudes in East Asia might have caused the predicted southern contraction and declines in the study species’ population during the LIG.
