 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>: Figure S4) might illustrate a difference in speciesâ€™ responses to habitat availability during the transition from the LIG into the last glacial period, reflecting the possibility that their specific climatic and environmental tolerances were associated with the breadth of their ecological niches [

For example, precipitation in the warmest quarter (Bio_18) is the most influential bioclimatic variable in present-day ENM prediction for all five of the species with early population growth, but makes a secondary contribution for the other species with late growth (Additional file
