<p id="Par26" class="p">In the present study, both our range and demographic analyses imply the contraction of the East Asian subtropical birdsâ€™ populations at the LIG and a subsequent expansion through the LGM to the present. The results suggest that the glacial maximum might only have a minor impact on the demography of East Asian organisms in contrast to the potential severe effect of the last interglacial climate. The concordant patterns of change in the multiple species allow us to make a more general picture about late Pleistocene range shifts in East Asian avifauna, which was alluded to by previous studies based on one or a few species [
