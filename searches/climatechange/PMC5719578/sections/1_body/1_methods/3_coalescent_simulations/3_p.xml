<p id="Par20" class="p">Bayesian coalescent inference of demographic history was conducted using BEAST 1.8.2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] with model selection. For each species, five demographic models were considered, including four parametric models (constant, expansion, exponential and logistic growth) and the flexible Bayesian Skygrid model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. The margin likelihoods of each model were estimated using both stepping-stone and path sampling methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] based on three replicates of 500 million MCMC generations with the HKY substitution model and strict molecular clocks, and compared by 
 <italic class="italic">log Bayes factor</italic> with values larger than three indicating a strong preference of one model against others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Recent mounting evidence has suggested time-dependent rates of molecular evolution with faster rates over shorter time frames than what are calibrated by phylogenetic divergences, in some cases by half [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>] to an order of magnitude [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]. In present study, the BEAST analyses were first conducted with a fixing mean substitution rate across genes of 3.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup> substitutions per site per year (s/s/y) for Passeriformes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>], and then rescaled using 5-fold (i.e. 1.65 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−8</sup> s/s/y) and 10-fold (3.3 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−9</sup> s/s/y) faster rates, respectively, to test the sensitivity of the prior settings. Convergence for each run was visually inspected and diagnosed with an effective sample size &gt;200 in Tracer 1.6 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. Final plotting of the best-fit demographic model for each species was generated based on the combined MCMC generations after discarding the first 10% as burn-in.
