<p id="Par21" class="p">In addition, we tested population expansions using a Bayesian algorithm implemented in LAMARC 2.1.8 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>] by inferring exponential population growth rates. Positive growth rates would indicate a growing population, while negative values suggest population shrinkage. We performed one short MCMC run (1000 samples, 100 steps as interval and 10,000 samples as burn-in) followed by a longer one (10,000 samples, 100 steps as interval and 10,000 samples as burn-in) for each species with default model priors. To improve search performance, a heating scheme was used with one cold and three heated chains with default temperature settings. Convergence on the parameter estimates was visually inspected in Tracer 1.6 with an effective sample size &gt;200.
