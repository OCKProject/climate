<p id="Par25" class="p">The favored models of multi-locus coalescent analyses using BEAST (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) supported an overall post-LIG population growth leading to a ~3–32-fold increase in their effective population sizes up to the present day (see details in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>: Figure S4). Employment of different molecular rate levels resulted in distinct time spans for the observed population growths but with a consistent pattern of demographic growth from LIG to LGM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM8" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>: Figure S4). This history of population expansion was further supported by large positive exponential population growth rates (254–873; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) estimated using LAMARC. Across the 11 birds, continuous population growth started in two distinct phases. For example, with 5-fold faster molecular rates, elevational generalists except 
 <italic class="italic">C. fortipes</italic> and one lowland specialist (
 <italic class="italic">A. morrisonia</italic>) underwent population growth around 98–116 Ka, right after the LIG; whereas the other six species (the four highland and one lowland specialist and one generalist) grew around 40–64 Ka, at the middle of the last glacial period (~12–112 Ka).
