 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2) were conservatively excluded from subsequent analyses, despite the difficulty in distinguishing between demographic change and natural selection as the cause for the observed non-neutrality. Finally, a final dataset of 25–30 evolutionarily independent and neutral loci were employed for each bird species (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2). All sequences generated in the current study were deposited in GenBank (accession numbers: KY434671-KY435354, KY437041-KY437069, KY597864-KY604704) and also provided in Additional file
