<p id="Par22" class="p">After data filtering and spatial rarefication, 77–532 occurrence records for each bird were used in ENM reconstructions (see details in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3). The resulted ENM for each species well encompassed historical distribution dynamics, indicating the reasonability of study area setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. With high AUC scores (0.924–0.975, see details in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3), the ENM analyses for all species clearly showed that the hindcasted area of suitable habitats for the 11 birds at the LGM were similar to those of the present day, whereas each species contracted its range southward to low-latitude areas at the LIG but with three different patterns (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>: Figure S1). That is, (1) the highland specialists contracted to the southern Heng-Duan Mountains in southwest China, (2) the lowland specialists retreated to coastal regions of southeast China and (3) the elevational generalists tended to survive at both of the two regions. Generalists had larger distribution ranges than specialists throughout the last glaciation cycle.
