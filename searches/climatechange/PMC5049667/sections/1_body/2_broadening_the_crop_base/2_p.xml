<p class="p">Diversification of agriculture, both in terms of crops grown and the agricultural system itself (e.g. intercropping), could significantly improve agricultural resilience, but the application of genomics to a far broader range of crops is also required to harness the full potential of many of these species, as well as for the staple crops which will continue to represent the main focus of breeding research. Knowledge‐intensive crop breeding approaches and translational genomics will contribute to develop climate‐proof, genetically enhanced seed‐embedded technology – which in synergy with sustainable agro‐ecosystem management, eco‐efficient crop husbandry and sound postharvest handling will assist feeding the world in this century of climate change.</p>
