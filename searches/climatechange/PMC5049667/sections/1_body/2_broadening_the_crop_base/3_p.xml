<p class="p">Future genomic‚Äêbased crop improvement might be generalized as advancing the productivity frontier, continuing and strengthening efforts to improve crop productivity and quality under generally favourable conditions, as well as intrinsic defences against pests, maximizing the amount and quality of food that can be produced from limited arable land. Particularly, large incremental returns on investment may be realized in crops that have received relatively limited prior attention, but which may be of great importance in parts of the world where development challenges are the greatest and market failure is most acute. In widely grown crops with long histories of improvement, large investments may be required to realize small incremental gains, but such gains will be leveraged quickly across large production areas.</p>
