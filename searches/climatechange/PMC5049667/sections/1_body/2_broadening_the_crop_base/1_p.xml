<p class="p">The current economic models for plant breeding have resulted in major investment and subsequent advances for a limited number of major crops, with little if any benefit for minor or orphan crops. The increased application of genomics coupled with the need to diversify the sources of our food supply will likely see this situation change. Substantial investment is now required for relatively minor gains in major crops. In contrast, our increased knowledge of crop genomics, together with reducing costs, is expected to facilitate the rapid improvement of minor crops and even the adaptation of nontraditional crop species for human consumption. A greater understanding of both the genomics and physiology of diverse plant species will be required if we are to increase diversity of both major and minor crops. The integration of new frontiers in crop modelling, genome biology and phenotyping technologies increases the potential for narrowing the genotype–phenotype divide and will contribute towards crop improvement through ‘plant breeding by design’ (Fridman and Zamir,
