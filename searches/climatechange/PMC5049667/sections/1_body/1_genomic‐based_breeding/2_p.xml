<p class="p">Understanding genetic diversity in a species at the DNA sequence level permits the identification of agronomically valuable genes and associated molecular genetic markers while providing a means to select for these genes in breeding programs. The main driver of the current genomic revolution is the advance of next‐generation DNA sequencing (NGS) technology, which has recently broken the boundary of the $1000 human genome. This technology is revolutionizing crop breeding as fast as it has revolutionized medicine. It not only enables the sequencing of diverse crop genomes but also facilitates the association of genomic diversity with agronomic traits, providing the foundation for genomic‐assisted breeding. Sequencing technology continues to advance and it is likely that within a few years, all major crops will have benefitted from sequence‐based genomic improvement.</p>
