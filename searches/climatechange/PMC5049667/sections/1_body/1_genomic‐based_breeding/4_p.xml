<p class="p">Over millions of years, new genes have evolved and been shuffled and selected in a wide range of environments to produce the diversity we see in wild species. In contrast, the selection and domestication of crops by humans is relatively recent, having occurred over the last 10 000 years or less. Currently, breeders of most major crops are reshuffling relatively few alleles to produce enhanced combinations that provide increased yield and other attractive agronomic characteristics (Gepts, 
 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Genomics offers the potential to greatly increase the diversity of alleles available to breeders through the mining of allied gene pools and the genomes of crop wild relatives. Scientists have recently issued a strong call for action and major investments into better characterizing the wealth of genetic resources that lies conserved in the world's genebanks (McCouch, 
 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The Diversity Seek initiative consortium aims to facilitate access to diverse germplasm and associated data. This germplasm, together with genomics tools, enables the rapid identification and selection of the rare novel beneficial alleles and their controlled incorporation into crop germplasm. As we enter the age of genomic‐based crop improvement, this technology will be used to help safeguard our future through increased food security.
