<p class="p">An understanding of gene networks and the identification of the sequence or epigenetic variation that underlies agricultural traits conferring environmental resilience would revolutionize our ability to truly breed for new ideotypes. These could be suited to particular environments and include the appropriate combination of stress‐tolerance genes for desirable traits, even for performance under environmental volatility itself. Genomics, in association with phenotypic information, can provide breeders with the knowledge they need to make more rapid selections and apply advanced breeding strategies to produce climate‐resilient crops. Genetic mapping and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis, association genetics (AG) studies and genomic selection (GS) approaches have recently had an impact on the development of new crop varieties. AG and GS were previously hampered by the lack of very high marker density coverage of the genome. However, the development of massively parallel NGS methods has made the characterization of very large numbers of markers possible (Edwards
