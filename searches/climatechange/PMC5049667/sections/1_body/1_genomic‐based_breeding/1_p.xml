<p class="p">A genomic‐based breeding strategy for new cultivars should start by defining the stress(es) that are expected to more severely affect crop production and productivity under a certain climate change scenario. As the impact of climate change will be different for diverse crops and environments, tailored solutions may need to be applied. Data from multi‐environment testing provide an opportunity for modelling stress impacts on crops and target populations. Plant breeders, crop physiologists and genebank curators will search for morphological and physiological traits in available germplasm that could enhance crop adaptation under such climatic variability. In this regard, crop physiology may help define ideotypes to be pursued for enhancing such adaptation. In the future, crops need to be more heat tolerant, with greater water and nutrient use efficiency, both to counter the effects of climate change and to mitigate the impact of crop production on the causes of climate change.</p>
