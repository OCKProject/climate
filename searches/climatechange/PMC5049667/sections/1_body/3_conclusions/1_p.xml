<p class="p">A second Green Revolution, driven largely by eliminating production constraints, may integrate activities towards advancing the productivity frontier and transforming production systems. Genomic tools provide an infrastructure to lay bare the secrets of the genetic potential of plants to respond to a range of environments. Much foundational work remains to be done – and translating this information into climate resilient crops will require additional large investments. As agricultural initiatives can take 15–30 years to yield maximal returns (Alston,
