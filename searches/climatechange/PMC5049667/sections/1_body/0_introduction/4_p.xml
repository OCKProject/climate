<p class="p">The requirement to increase food production under new climatic and agronomic constraints presents three potential challenges: (i) to modify our selection criteria to focus on efficiency or adaptation/tolerance to stress(es) in addition to total yield, (ii) to determine whether such efficiency/stress‚Äêtolerance alleles are still present and exploitable in our elite material and wider breeding germplasm and (iii) to develop new and to expand the use of current minor crops, particularly where they offer better nutrition, environmental sustainability and/or resilience while requiring lower inputs than current major crop species. The altered agricultural paradigm away from high inputs towards stability and environmental resilience of yields, alongside decreasing inputs, is a daunting challenge. However, this challenge can be addressed through the accelerated application of genomic tools.</p>
