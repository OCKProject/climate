<p class="p">The failure to maintain global food production in line with population growth is evidenced by increasing food prices and greater global food insecurity (FAO, 
 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Continued failure to maintain increases in food production will lead to further increases in food prices in developed countries, as well as social unrest and famine in developing countries. Predicting future food shortages is a challenge due to the variable nature of the climate. Fisher

 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Global climate change will make it difficult to achieve these yield increases in some regions. In addition, Hisas predicted that there will be a global deficit of major crops by 2020 (Hisas, 
 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The main causes of yield loss include extreme temperatures; altered rainfall patterns, which lead to droughts and floods; and other extreme weather events, the frequency of which are expected to increase due to the changing climate. Crop pathogens and pests may also change their geographical distribution, with predicted increases in severity due to changes in rainfall, increasing temperatures and CO
