<p class="p">Crop breeding has largely been driven by selection for yield and adaptation to specific agro‐climatic regions. However, selection under such ‘ideal’, high‐input environments is likely to have led to the loss of some genes for efficiency or adaptation to stress; particularly, if such genes have minor deleterious effects when present in nonstressed or high‐input environments. Moreover, not all agroecological practices are compatible with the Green Revolution cultivars – for example, most modern semi‐dwarf (
 <italic class="italic">sd1</italic>) rice cultivars perform poorly under the rain‐fed ecosystems of Asia and Africa that occupy ~30% of world rice lands, where drought, submergence, low soil fertility and other abiotic stresses are commonplace (Paterson and Li,
