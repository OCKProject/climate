<p class="p">The three key steps in agricultural history – domestication, displacement of native crops by major commercial crops together with genetically limited introductions of non‐native species and the intensification of agricultural production during and since the Green Revolution – each represent potential bottlenecks which have reduced crop genetic and trait diversity. Domestication has often been a haphazard affair with some regions, such as Europe, domesticating relatively few species, while other regions have been responsible for many of the major crops now grown (Meyer

Host plant disease resistance and dwarfing genes were introduced during the Green Revolution, together with an increased use of irrigation and artificial nitrogen fertilizer, further genetic improvement to utilize the increased resources, and highly tailored management of biotic and abiotic stresses (Khush,

 <xref rid="pbi12467-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). These advances have led to significant increases in production of the major staples over the last century across most of the world (Fischer
