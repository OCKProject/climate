  <p class="p">Results of the jackknife test of variable importance. The environmental variable with highest gain when used in isolation is Mean Temperature of Warmest Quarter (Bio10), which therefore appears to provide the most useful information by itself. The environmental variable that decreases the gain the most when omitted is land cover, which appears to have the most information that isn't present in the other variables</p>
