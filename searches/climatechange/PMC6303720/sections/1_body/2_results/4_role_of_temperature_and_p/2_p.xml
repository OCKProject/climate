<p class="p">Our model showed that brown bear distribution was attributed to bioclimatic variables associated with climate change: annual temperature (BIO1) and precipitation (BIO12; Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The spatially averaged current mean annual temperature of brown bear habitat was −1.2°C (maximum 17.1, minimum −13.7°C) and is predicted to increase to 1.6°C (maximum 19.9°C and minimum −11.2°C) by 2,050. Similarly, current annual mean precipitation of brown bear habitat is predicted to increase by 13%, from 406 mm to 459 mm by 2,050.
