<p class="p">Our results showed that the current suitable habitat will be reduced by 11% (378,861 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) across Central Asia by 2,050 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) due to climate change. The most suitable habitat is predicted to be lost in India (26% loss), Pakistan (17%), and Nepal (13%). In China, 290,200 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (13%) of suitable habitat is predicted to be lost by 2,050 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). However, a small increase in suitable habitat for brown bear is predicted in Uzbekistan relative to the entire study area (10,271 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), but a relatively large gain within the country (51%; Table
