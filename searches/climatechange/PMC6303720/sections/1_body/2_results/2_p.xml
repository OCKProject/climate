<p class="p">After removing highly correlated variables (&gt;

 </xref>). Overall, annual and seasonal temperature and precipitation were the main bioclimatic factors contributing to brown bear habitat suitability, which together contributed more than 90% to the species distribution model (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Annual Mean Temperature (BIO1) contributed the most (43.9%), followed by Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (BIO8; 27.1%), Precipitation of Driest Month (BIO14; 5.2%), Minimum Temperature of Coldest Month (BIO11; 4.4%), and Annual Precipitation (BIO12; 4.3%) to the model. Aspect, slope, and land cover contributed &lt;3% to our model (Table
