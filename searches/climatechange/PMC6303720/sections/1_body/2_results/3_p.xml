<p class="p">The result of the jackknife test of variable importance showed that highest gain was in annual mean temperature and elevation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The environmental variable, which decreased the gain the most when it was omitted, was the land cover (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Our model was well represented because the omission rate was close to the predicted omission as a function of the cumulative threshold and both were calculated based on the training presence records (Figure

 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Our model and environmental variables described the current distribution of brown bear very well in the study area (AUC = 0.90; Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Response curves showed each environmental variable affected the prediction of brown bear distribution, which keeps all other environmental variables at their average sample value and showed how the logistic prediction changes as each environmental variable is varied (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34645-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
