<p class="p">Around the world, climate change has had significant direct and indirect impacts on terrestrial species, by being a major cause of speciation and species extirpation (Pound &amp; Salzmann, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Many studies have recently focused on the ecological (Etterson &amp; Mazer, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Wikelski &amp; Tertitski, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), ethological (Munoz, Marquez, &amp; Real, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and biological changes (Torres‐Diaz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Hulme, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) in relation to climatic change. For example, various ecosystems are vulnerable to climate change which may induce a broad array of adverse effects such as disturbances of phenological events, food web disruptions, pathogens and disease spread and ultimately, in worst case scenarios, may include extinction risks (Wu, Lu, Zhou, Chen, &amp; Xu, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, climate change has impacted species distributions by reducing and fragmenting of the area of animal habitats (Chen, Hill, Ohlemuller, Roy, &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Loarie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Lord &amp; Whitlatch, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lundhede et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Su, Aryal, Nan, &amp; Ji, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Wu, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, to tackle the challenge of the changing climatic conditions, species have adopted different mechanisms to counteract the magnitude and speed of climate change either individually or within a population (Hill, Griffiths, &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). For example, natural populations may react to climate change either collectively by shifting their geographical habitats (Hoffmann &amp; Sgro, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), or individually by adjusting their behavioral activities through modifications of their diet, activity and energy budget and reproductive tactics (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although these tactical responses have proven to have a short‐term efficiency (Crane, Roncoli, &amp; Hoogenboom, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) to withstand climatic changes, some studies showed that up to 42% of species in certain geographical areas are at risk of extinction in the long term due to deforestation and habitat fragmentation solely (Sodhi, Koh, Brook, &amp; Ng, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>).
