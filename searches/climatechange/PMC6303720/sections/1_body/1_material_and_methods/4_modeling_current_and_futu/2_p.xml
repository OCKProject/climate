<p class="p">We used maximum entropy (MaxEnt) species distribution modeling (SDM; Phillips Steven and Dudík, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) to map the current and predicted future distribution of brown bear in the study area. MaxEnt is a widely used tool for modeling species distributions using presence data of species and various environmental parameters (Kramer‐Schadt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). There are limitations in MaxEnt modeling (Boria, Olson, Goodman, &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Radosavljevic &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We minimized these limitations by using validated presence data (from field surveys, past studies, and IUCN distributions map). Finally, we evaluated and selected the best model projection of current and future scenarios. Since our data were based on field surveys and areas with existing brown bear presence in protected areas, there may be some biases due to auto‐correlation of localities and variables (Boria et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>); therefore, we validated the model using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve to correct for biased samples and variables (Pearce et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Roura‐Pascual, Brotons, Peterson, &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). We prepared suitable habitat of brown bear based on equal training sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and removed the area below &lt;0.39 of equal training sensitivity and specificity logistic threshold (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34645-tbl-0002" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
