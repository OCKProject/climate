<p class="p">Any loss of suitable habitat within protected areas is of concern for brown bear conservation in Central Asia, because it may result in bears moving out of protected area due to climate‐induced range shift (Upward and northward). Such movement may increase encounters with humans and a subsequent increase in human–bear conflicts and increased bear mortalities. However, more research is necessary to determine the impact of climate change on food resources (bottom‐up regulation) and nutrition of bears. As well, the addition of mortality risk to bear models will help to understand top‐down factors that may affect populations (Nielsen, McDermid, Stenhouse, &amp; Boyce, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The data necessary to resolve such nutritional and mortality‐related factors are to our knowledge not available across the entirety of our immense study areas but should be a focus of future research. In addition to upwards migration, future climate change may cause some mammal species to move northward (Francl et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The range shift from southern areas such as India, Nepal, and China to northern regions such as Mongolia would be unlikely due to habitat fragmentation and loss (Inkley et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Rosenzweig et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Such a situation might contribute to local extirpation of brown bear and low genetic diversity (Guralnick, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Hadly et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). To prevent this, brown bear movement between suitable habitats should be facilitated through the development of corridors which connect habitat between protected areas in different countries (Ramiadantsoa, Ovaskainen, Rybicki, &amp; Hanski, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Such a conservation effort would, of course, be challenging, and require the participation and collaboration of different countries.
