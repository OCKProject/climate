<p class="p">Habitat use by organisms reflects the environmental characteristics that augment their fitness (Fretwell, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1969</xref>). Generally, it is supposed that a species distribution or individuals within a population is a good indicator of habitat structure and particularly manifests their preference toward the habitat qualities. Predictive modeling has become a valuable tool for successful conservation planning or wildlife management through identification and prediction of habitat appropriateness for given species (Schadt et al.,
