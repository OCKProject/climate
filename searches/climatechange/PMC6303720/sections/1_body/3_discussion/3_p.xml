<p class="p">Across Central Asia, suitable habitats of the brown bear are widely distributed in higher elevation regions and are predicted to moderately decrease by 2,050 due to climate change; however, the extent of the change is not felt equally in the countries. In China, where most of the current suitable habitat for brown bears is found, a loss of 13% of suitable habitat is likely to have a significant impact on the distribution of bears in the country, but much of this change will occur outside the protected areas with a minor change in the habitats inside protected areas. For countries which have small suitable areas for brown bears, loss of suitable habitat may have more profound effects. India for example, which offers a relatively small amount of suitable habitat for brown bears, is likely to experience the greatest impact on brown bear distribution given the significant loss of predicted habitats inside protected areas. A similar situation was observed in Pakistan and Nepal. Therefore, the establishment of future protected areas may be necessary to ensure that the extirpation of bears does not occur in these areas such as India, Pakistan, and Nepal. While suitable habitat is predicted to increase in Uzbekistan and Bhutan, such an increase is unlikely to offset the total loss of habitat to brown bears in Central Asia as those countries have very little suitable brown bear habitat (Aryal et al.,
