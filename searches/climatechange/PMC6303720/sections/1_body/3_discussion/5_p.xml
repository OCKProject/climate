<p class="p">Our results also highlighted the influence of predicted temperature increase from −1.2°C to 1.6°C by 2,050 on brown bear. The global change in temperature will inevitably lead to challenging impacts not only on brown bear distribution patterns but also on their ethological repertoire and cyclic and seasonal changes of biological activities. Generally, mammals can cope with escalating thermal stress by adopting some thermoregulatory behavioral responses (Sawaya, Ramsey, &amp; Ramsey, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) including shifting to more nocturnal activities, as a least‐cost thermoregulation strategy, to reduce the costs associated with autonomic temperature regulation (Maloney, Moss, Cartmell, &amp; Mitchell, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Bears are largely diurnal (MacHutchon, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) but become less active at daytime and more nocturnal when temperature rises (McLellan &amp; McLellan, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Similarly, failure or inadequacy of the behavioral thermoregulatory measures will inevitably lead to costlier physiological adaptations to climate changes. For instance, increased temperatures have been strongly linked to shorter periods of denning in bears (Inouye, Barr, Armitage, &amp; Inouye, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Shorter durations of hibernations could lead to altered energy budgets, reduced cub survival and fitness and higher incidents of human–bear conflicts (Pigeon, Stenhouse, &amp; Côté, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Finally, an examination of regional studies over a 50‐year period showed that carnivore body sizes have generally increased over the past half‐century. This may be a result from the increases in the length of warm season associated with climate change (Yom‐Tov, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Following this trend, brown bears may also increase in their body size that mandates extra‐energy demands which could threat the predator–prey relationship through magnifying predation effects and reduce the probability of prey coexistence (Thakur, Kunne, Griffin, &amp; Eisenhauer, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). An example could also clarify the effect of climate change on predator–prey dynamics in the region (Aryal et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Brown bears can prey heavily on small mammals such as pika (
 <italic class="italic">Ochotona</italic> spp.) and marmot (
 <italic class="italic">Marmota</italic> spp.) at high altitudes which are sensitive to temperature and precipitation changes (Francl, Hayhoe, Saunders, &amp; Maurer, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>); therefore, future climate change may alter their distribution and population dynamics. Pika and marmot, which effectively inhabit high‐elevation “islands,” may have to migrate upwards in elevation in order to live under preferred climate conditions. If climate changes cause reductions in wild prey populations or availability, there may be an increased risk of brown bears switching their feeding strategy to kill more livestock in the region (Aryal et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34645-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref> ), thereby exacerbating human–bear conflict.
