<p class="p">The effects of climatic factors on plants differ according to the various growth and development stages of plants. For example, climate conditions influence germination so that the germinating of seeds of different species and in various regions differs substantially. The seeds of plants that grow in temperate latitudes require low temperatures or fluctuating temperature conditions that last for a certain amount of time to break dormancy (Hsieh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2004</xref>). However, numerous studies have shown that some temperate plant species can break seed dormancy through exposure to high temperatures and long photoperiod days (Isikawa 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">1954</xref>; Johnson and Irgens-Moller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">1964</xref>; Stearns and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">1958</xref>). Some temperate species can break dormancy and sprout only after exposure to a period of low temperature following exposure to high temperature, such as

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">1995</xref>) and peony seeds. The germination of seeds from numerous species also varies with environmental conditions, such as those for 
 <italic class="italic">Tsuga canadensis</italic> L. The seeds of 
 <italic class="italic">Tsuga canadensis</italic> L. break dormancy and germinate after exposure to 10 weeks of low temperature. However, the temperature required for germination of seeds that have not been exposed to low-temperature stratification increases with the length of photoperiod. For a general photoperiod of 8–12 h, the optimal germination temperature ranges from 17 to 22 °C, Whereas if the length of the photoperiod is 16 h, the optimal germination temperature increases to 27 °C (Stearns and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120" class="xref">1958</xref>). However, 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic> (Mirb.) Franco seeds that have not undergone low-temperature stratification can successfully germinate after a short-photoperiod below 25 °C (Johnson and Irgens-Moller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">1964</xref>). The climate requirements and resistance may differ even among the various organs of a plant species. A survey exploring the freeze injuries of 
 <italic class="italic">Pyrus koehnei</italic> C.K. Schneid. showed that 90 % of 6-year-old plants were frozen to death under −14 °C and 50 % of suckers were frozen to death under −12 °C, whereas only 28 % of stem surfaces exhibited freeze injury. The median lethal temperature of the different tissues ranged from −10 to −15 °C (Nee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">1995</xref>).
