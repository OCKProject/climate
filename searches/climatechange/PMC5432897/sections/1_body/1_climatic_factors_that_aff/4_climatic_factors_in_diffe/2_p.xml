<p class="p">Distinct microtopographies and microclimates influence precipitation; even a slight variation in rainfall may substantially affect plant growth. For example, at high altitudes, the fruiting amount of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinidia</italic> is inversely proportional to the degree of overlap of flowering periods and the East Asian rainy season. A high degree of overlap implies low fruiting rates for a certain year, whereas a low degree of overlap increases the fruiting rate. Certain species lack fruit every year because the East Asian rainy season overlaps the flowering period. This severely affects the reproduction and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinidia</italic>. and damages economic growth related to the plants (Nee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">1994</xref>). Moreover, plant species respond differently to climate changes. For example, if plants, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Acer saccharum</italic> Marsh. and eastern hemlock, which originate from different regions, are planted at one location, the plants from the north areas or high altitudes stop growing early in the autumn (Nienstaedt and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">1961</xref>; Robak and Magnesen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">1970</xref>). Altitudes also affect the temperature requirements and responses of plants. For example, the seeds and buds of 
 <italic class="italic">Actinidia</italic> have different dormancy conditions at different altitudes. The higher the altitude, the higher the chilling requirement to break seed and bud dormancy (Fan and Nee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2007</xref>). By contrast, peach and cherry trees have lower chilling requirements at high altitudes (Huang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">2000</xref>).
