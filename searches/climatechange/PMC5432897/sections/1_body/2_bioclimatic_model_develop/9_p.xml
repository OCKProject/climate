<p class="p">Because of article length limitations, we introduced only three major types of plant bioclimatic models. In addition to the models introduced in this study, other bioclimatic models are of importance in separate fields of development. Basically, the diversity of relationships between organisms and climates leads to diversity among statistical (empirical) models, such as the thermal time, degree-days, heat sums, growing degree-days, physiological time, and spring warming models. The physiological and genetic diversity of organisms contributes to the diversity of mechanistic models, such as the parallel, sequential, deepening rest, four phases, Utah (Richardson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">1974</xref>), positive chill (Linsley-Noakes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">1995</xref>), and North Carolina models (Gilreath and Buchanan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">1981</xref>). The diversity of biological and statistical theories contributes to the diversity of theoretical models, such as the models based on carbon equilibrium, the interaction of hormones, survival and reproductive adaptation, ecological niches, genetic behaviors, biological processes, and remote sensing. Naturally, some of the models involve a certain degree of correlation, which occasionally enables their mutual and complementary combination.
