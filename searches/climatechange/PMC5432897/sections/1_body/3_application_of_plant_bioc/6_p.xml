<p class="p">The mapped atmosphere-plant-soil system model (Lenihan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">2008</xref>) can be used to assess the effects of climate changes on vegetation distribution, ecological system productivity, or forest fires. Remote-sensing time sequential data can be used to measure and assess land field surface phenology for assessing the vegetation responses after fires (van Leeuwen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">2010</xref>). In addition, regarding large-scale biological effect research, the BIOME-BGC, CLASS, Interannual Flux Tower Upscaling Sensitivity Experiment, third generation Coupled Global Climate Model, I/O buffer information specification, Lund-Potsdam-Jena, National Center for Atmospheric Research Land Surface Model, and remote-sensing-based NDVI/NDWI models can be used for assessing the effects of climate changes on large areas of vegetation (Bonan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2010</xref>; Foley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">1996</xref>; Sitch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117" class="xref">2003</xref>). These models are convenient for use in large plain areas; thus, they have been widely adopted by studies in numerous temperate continental countries in recent years.
