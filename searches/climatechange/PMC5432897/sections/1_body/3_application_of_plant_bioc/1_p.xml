<p class="p">Plant bioclimatic models have been applied and developed in different fields, such as for predicting and evaluating the influence of climate changes on plant bioclimatology (Hänninen and Tanino

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2007</xref>; Hao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2001</xref>; Morin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2009</xref>), improving the primary productivity of ecosystem (Kramer and Mohren 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">1996</xref>; Watsona et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131" class="xref">2013</xref>), helping patients with pollinosis predict the time when pollen will occur in the air (Frenguelli and Bricchi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">1998</xref>), assisting in crop or forest management and disaster-risk decision assessment, diagnosing the effects of climate on crop growth and development, predicting or assessing the correlations between species and their survival or adaptive strategy evolution (Chuine and Beaubien 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2001</xref>; Morin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">2008</xref>), rebuilding regional climate environments in the past (Maurer et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133" class="xref">2012</xref>), forecasting the flowering time of cherry blossoms for developing the tourisy industry (Allen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2014</xref>), and diagnosing the growth and development conditions of organisms as well as diseases and pests (Villalta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127" class="xref">2007</xref>). Unsurprisingly, these applications are correlated with one other to a certain degree. In recent years, plant bioclimatic models have been continuously applied to climate change research to evaluate the effects of climate changes on organisms. This implies that the importance of applying plant models in climate change-related research has constantly increased (Peñuelas and Filella 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">2001</xref>). Thus, this study introduced the application of bioclimatic models in assessing the influence of climate changes and in disaster prevention.
