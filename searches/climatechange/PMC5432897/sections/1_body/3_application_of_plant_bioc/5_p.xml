<p class="p">Recently, ecologists have focused on the effects of climate changes on species distribution, the resulting habitat fragmentation, and relevant species conservation arguments (Channell and Lomolino

Thus, numerous species distribution models developed on the based of the climate ecological niche theory of bioclimatic models have been applied in research on the effects of climate changes on species distribution and habitats. A major portion of these models are also referred to as climate envelope models (CEMs) (Hijmans and Graham 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2006</xref>), such as the maximum entropy models (Phillips et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98" class="xref">2004</xref>), machine-learning-based artificial neural network models, and integrated species distribution models (e.g., BIOMOD) (Coetzee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2009</xref>; Thuiller 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, not all species distribution models are categorized as CEMs. For example, although the PHENOFIT model was developed on the basis of biological processes and many physiologically based SDMs (Kearney and Porter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">2009</xref>) are used to evaluate the effects of climate changes on species distribution, they are not CEMs.
