<p class="p">In our previous review of climate change research on plants (Hsieh and Chiou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2013</xref>), we found that phenological gardens and phenological observation networks are used to record the effects of past climate changes on organisms in climate change research and monitor the direct influence of climate changes on organisms. Bioclimatic models are used to assess the possible effects of future climate changes and assist in making disaster-prevention decisions. Bioclimatic models and phenological observation networks are complementary in assessing the effects of climate changes; neither can be neglected. Without the historical records of phenological observation networks, bioclimatic models lack modeling data; without bioclimatic models, phenological observation networks lack the function of risk assessment and cannot assist in disaster-prevention decision-making. Thus, phenological fingerprints and models have been developed rapidly for applications in international climate change research. The use of regional phenological fingerprints, which was once a tool for small- to medium-scale spaces, has been expanded to continental and global scales through the establishment of global bioclimatic monitoring plans (Bruns et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2003</xref>; Parmesan and Yohe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">2003</xref>; Root et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109" class="xref">2003</xref>). Regarding the application of models, although the global bioclimatic models developed on the basis of remote sensing data have been widely applied in studies in temperate continental countries in Europe and North America, small- to medium-scale phenological fingerprints and models are more suitable for Taiwan because of its small terrain.
