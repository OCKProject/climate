<p id="Par10" class="p">ICCiLD adopted several techniques to manage uncertainties and difficulties of data collection. In the case of Arviat, the substantial number of lakes and intertidal areas resulted in low coherence in data, as these areas change more over time, known as temporal decorrelation (3vGeomatics Inc. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2013</xref>). This low coherence meant that additional scenes (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2015</xref>). The high degree of standing water in Arviat during summer months made it difficult to determine true ground movement, as a result, better quality interferograms
