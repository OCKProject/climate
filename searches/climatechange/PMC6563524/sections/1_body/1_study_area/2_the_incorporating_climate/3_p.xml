    <italic class="italic">Suitable for development</italic> The area is thought to be stable and available data indicate little or no evidence of ice-rich and changing permafrost conditions.

   <p id="Par14" class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Possibly suitable for development</italic> The area is possibly stable for development as ground conditions have limited indicators of changing permafrost conditions. In some cases, due to the lack of quality remote sensing data, the presence of permafrost could not be ruled out. Additional characteristics of the area include exposed rock, bare soil, low vegetation, a slope &lt; 4%, or a non-south facing aspect.

  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par15" class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Marginally suitable for development</italic> All data indicate that some ground ice is present, and the area is, therefore, only marginally suitable for future development. Additional characteristics of the area include low vegetation or a slope 4°–10° (includes south facing).
