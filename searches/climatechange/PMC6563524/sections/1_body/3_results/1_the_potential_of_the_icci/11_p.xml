<p id="Par61" class="p">Interviewees provided recommendations for improving the usability of the maps produced. Recommendations included adding more engaging or oral activities (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6). ICCiLD users commented that knowledge sharing at the community level was good (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 22) and that using more of these engagement activities in the future was advisable. Youth were engaged in filming permafrost monitoring and community demonstrations of research equipment were given. Additionally, the installation of a community permafrost monitoring site in Arviat was mentioned by members of the community. Training on how to obtain the data from the site was forthcoming and the community had plans to extract and use the data. When interviewed, creators believed that if appropriate people were identified in the community, minimal training would be required to engage those interested in making on-the-ground observations. This would allow additional skill sharing at the community level, save money, and improve the accuracy of project mapping data. Other recommendations included ‘consider the local quality of life’ (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) and ‘clarify the ranking system used’ (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4). Finally, select users made a general recommendation concerning development in Arviat (e.g. ‘do not build on water’, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 5). This suggestion implies community members are concerned with community drainage issues, interviewees did not elaborate on whether this was due to the inconvenience of standing water in the community or because of the connection between standing water and permafrost degradation.
