  <bold class="bold">Consult with decision makers</bold> Include decision makers from all levels as early as possible in the process. In research design, local decision makers have pertinent insight on community priorities.

  <bold class="bold">Integrate different ways of knowing</bold> Integrate Indigenous knowledge systems into the mapping outputs, to reduce distrust in the work, and to uphold Indigenous land claims agreements. If data cannot be integrated into the map, a summary document should be attached to all reports to avoid the two pieces of information being interpreted separately (i.e. without the full data set).

 <p id="Par90" class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Provide data access</bold> Ensure easily accessible data and understandable outputs. Consider whether the provision of working documents throughout the process may also improve the timeliness of outputs for decision-making.
 </p>
 <p id="Par91" class="p">
  <bold class="bold">Operationalize the work</bold> Consult with decision makers to improve map usability and operationalize outputs. Tailor outputs to the local context. Considering what map categories mean for structural risk, foundation choices, or maintenance can improve usability of outputs.
