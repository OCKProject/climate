<p id="Par80" class="p">In northern Canada, the complexity of these planning decisions is compounded by different worldviews and knowledge systems embodied in science and Inuit philosophies on planning (Bates 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2007</xref>; Berkes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2009</xref>). Creating maps, which represent Western scientific methods, risks privileging Western science above Indigenous ways of knowing (Castleden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>). This prioritization of one knowledge system over another is problematic because Indigenous knowledge provides valuable historical and context-specific data in an area where limited Western scientific data exist. Additionally, Canadian Arctic governance structures also require the inclusion of this knowledge through the administration of the land claims agreement (NTI et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2010</xref>). Whilst technical data on permafrost thaw is important for adaptation decision-making, there is further work to be done on adequately incorporating different worldviews and philosophies when considering climate change adaptation to ensure that adaptation options fit with Indigenous philosophies (Tester and Irniq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2008</xref>). Whilst the ICCILD project did collect Indigenous knowledge relating to observations of landscape changes in the area over time, interviewees seemed unsure or uncertain as to how that information would be incorporated into the project. Interviewees also indicated that they thought the project design lacked significant consideration of how Indigenous philosophies and worldviews might impact project success. Similar concerns over the ability to incorporate and utilize Indigenous knowledge into adaptation planning decisions in Nunavut were also raised in Ford et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2017</xref>). Inuit planning philosophies are often based on an acceptance that the future will be uncertain, in which high value is placed on flexibility (Bates 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2007</xref>). One of the four Inuit maligait (natural laws) describes the notion of continually planning/preparing for a better future, often linked to sustainability for future generations. In contrast, the Western perspective of trying to reduce uncertainty and predict future events is often seen as rigid, inflexible, and even arrogant (Bates 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2007</xref>; Fienup-Riordan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2010</xref>). Work in Alaska on ‘Cultural Theories of Risk’ and climate change adaptation highlight worldviews, which are based on a respectful and ethical behaviour and the practice of remaining in balance with the land. The concept of permanent settlements can somewhat contradict with these Indigenous laws of sustainable land stewardship. This contrasting worldview on what is seen as sustainable planning may play a part in how well-received a climate change adaptation project is in a community and ultimately, whether the project outputs are adopted and used by community members. These worldviews can be at odds with state and federal systems, sometimes resulting in cultural and regulatory barriers to adaptation (McNeeley and Lazrus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2014</xref>; Tester and Irniq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2008</xref>). The literature suggests that the incorporation of Indigenous knowledge in adaptation planning is a challenge across northern regions and is not specific to this project alone (Chapin III et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2017</xref>; Knapp and Trainor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2013</xref>; Labbé et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2017</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> provides suggestions on integrating Indigenous knowledge into a hazard map. Other potential tools for future hazard mapping research include the utilization of “clumsy solutions”, where discussions and workshops ensure multiple perceptions and values are captured in adaptation decisions (Verweij et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">2014</xref>). Alternatively, fuzzy cognitive mapping techniques can also improve integration of different worldviews into hazard mapping projects (Özesmi and Özesmi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2004</xref>), allowing for representation of spiritual or cultural areas which should not be used for housing development and the incorporation of historical data on past community ground subsidence events.
