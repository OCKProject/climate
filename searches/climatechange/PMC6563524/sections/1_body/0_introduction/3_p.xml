<p id="Par4" class="p">In response to these experienced and projected impacts, communities and decision makers are identifying opportunities for adaptation to manage the impacts of permafrost degradation on infrastructure and livelihoods (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2015</xref>). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) describes adaptation as “the process of adjustment to actual or expected climate and its effects, in order to either lessen or avoid harm or exploit beneficial opportunities” (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2014</xref>). Numerous adaptations are occurring in response to permafrost degradation. Efforts to protect building stability, for instance, include retrofitting older infrastructure through drainage improvement and removal of skirting around buildings to improve airflow (Calmels et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2016</xref>). Additionally, new infrastructure adaptation includes the utilization of adaptive foundation types such as spaceframes to minimize heat transfer and maximize ground cooling (Lamoureux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2015</xref>). In some regions of the Russian Arctic, adaptation is occurring through the demolition of unstable buildings (leaving the foundation structures in place) allowing the ground to refreeze and then rebuilding these structures using lighter building materials (Nyland

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2016</xref>). In other cases, thermosyphons are installed, using heat transfer fluid to remove heat from foundations of infrastructure projects (Lamoureux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2015</xref>; McGregor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2008</xref>). Adaptation of key transportation infrastructure in the northern regions includes the recent extensive monitoring of permafrost at Iqaluit Airport to determine ideal location for the building of a new runway (Mathon-Dufour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2015</xref>) and the testing of new culvert drainage systems on the Alaska Highway to minimize permafrost thaw (Transport Canada
