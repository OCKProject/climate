<p id="Par5" class="p">In addition to technologies aimed at mitigating permafrost thaw impacts on existing infrastructure, the utilization of hazard mapping for monitoring and categorizing areas of risk to identify preferential areas for development is the key to adaptation in permafrost environments (Champalle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>). Planning for and making infrastructure decisions based on potential permafrost thaw in Northern communities is more cost-effective adaptation than retrofitting infrastructure, (Melvin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2017</xref>) and development suitability and hazard mapping have a large part to play in supporting local planning decisions. Hazard mapping is a spatial representation of risk associated with a specified hazard (Champalle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>) and can determine the current and future hazard risk to an area (Preston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>). Hazard mapping has a long tradition in disaster risk reduction and risk communication (Preston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>). It is also used for climate adaptation applications in northern Canada for risks associated with permafrost, coastal hazards, landslides, sea ice, riverine flooding and forest fires (Champalle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>; Collaborative for Advanced Landscape Planning 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2016</xref>; Hatcher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sheppard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2012</xref>). There has been widespread use of hazard mapping across the northern regions of Canada to prepare and plan for climate change in a region which is expected to be significantly impacted by warming temperatures. Champalle et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2013</xref>) provide an extensive review of hazard mapping utilization for adaptation in the built environment in northern Canada and identify barriers impeding utilization of hazard maps. The barriers include, a limited end-user awareness of the existence of these maps, coupled with a mismatch in the way that data are made available meaning end-users are unable to access and view hazard maps. The review also suggests that a closer working relationship between mapping experts and end-users would be beneficial in increasing operability, understanding, and trust in outputs. Despite increasing interest in hazard mapping, few studies have evaluated how such maps are used in decision-making or documented the perspectives of end-users (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2018</xref>; Preston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2011</xref>). This is a missed opportunity for assessing the effectiveness of hazards maps, learning what works and what does not, and for sharing good practices and experiences (Bours et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2015</xref>; Ford and Berrang Ford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2015</xref>).
