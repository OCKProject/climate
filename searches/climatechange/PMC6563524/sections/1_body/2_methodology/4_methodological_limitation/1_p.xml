<p id="Par43" class="p">The long timescales of climate change and the uncertainty of feedback systems mean that adaptation can be considered as a process of continual adjustment (Bours et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2014b</xref>; Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2018</xref>). This makes defining a successful endpoint for adaptation challenging. Consequently, this paper considers adaptation as a continually evolving process and chooses to evaluate the processes or strategies of adaptation rather than the specific outcomes. In practice, this means that this paper applied a process-based evaluation, exploring the perceived usability of the categories identified in the map, the outreach and engagement methods used during the project and the local interpretation of the quality and usability of these maps.
