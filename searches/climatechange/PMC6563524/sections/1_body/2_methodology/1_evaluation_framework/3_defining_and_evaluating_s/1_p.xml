<p id="Par24" class="p">Defining success in adaptation projects is challenging, as what comprises ‘good adaptation’ and thus ‘good hazard maps’ is highly subjective and contextual (Bours et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">b</xref>; Wise et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is particularly pertinent in Nunavut, where Inuit worldviews and cultural practices shape the context within which science is conducted and where community members retain a significant understanding of the natural environment (Labbé et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2017</xref>). Consequently, the second step in the evaluation framework created a logic model to define successful adaptation in the context of ICCiLD. The model highlights connections between inputs, activities and outputs; considers the appropriateness of project assumptions; documents stakeholder expectations; and examines why some outcomes may or may not have occurred (AUSAID
