<p id="Par32" class="p">The current and future success and influence of an adaptation project is determined not only by the technical aspects of the work, but also by how the project leverages and links to the broader institutional environment which may support or constrain adaptation (Ford and King

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2010</xref>). Therefore, we examined the likelihood that the ICCiLD project will inform decision-making on adaptation to permafrost change in the short-, medium-, and long-term (i.e. inform land-use planning through the utilization of the suitability maps in community planning documents). We applied a modified version of Ford and King’s (

   <p id="Par33" class="p">
    <italic class="italic">Funding and resources</italic> The inputs made available to facilitate adaptation and are important for ensuring that the output of an adaptation project is supported on completion (e.g. resources are made available for utilizing hazard maps in land-use planning). Many adaptation projects identify opportunities for adaptation which remain unrealized due to an absence of resources for implementation (Champalle et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2015</xref>).

    <italic class="italic">Institutional organization</italic> The role of organizations (e.g. government departments, community bodies) in coordinating and directing adaptation activities. In absence of such coordination, adaptation projects are often ad hoc and lack the strategic guidance necessary for effective implementation (Labbé et al.

    <italic class="italic">Usable science</italic> The extent to which the project works closely with knowledge users to ensure the work is pertinent, timely and integrates necessary information to inform decisions (Ford et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2013</xref>). Failure to do this can result in research that is not trusted, understood, or is supplied too late (or early) in decision cycles (Ford and King

    <italic class="italic">Public support</italic> The degree of understanding and backing from the general population for acting on climate change, particularly in cases where adaptation involves financial costs or disproportionately affects certain households or communities. This is influenced by risk perception and past experiences of climate change impacts (García de Jalón et al.

For example, those stakeholders involved at the initial stages of the project may be able to influence the project design. Stakeholder engagement is recognized to improve the effectiveness of adaptation implementation (Sherman and Ford

    <italic class="italic">. IQ</italic> is a collection of societal values held and adhered to by Inuit (e.g. the value

    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). Since the creation of Nunavut in 1999, policy making in the territory is mandated to incorporate Inuit Societal Values held and adhered to by Inuit communities (Government of Nunavut

    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2010</xref>). These values are integrated in adaptation decision-making in the territory and as a result are an important factor to consider (Labbé et al.
