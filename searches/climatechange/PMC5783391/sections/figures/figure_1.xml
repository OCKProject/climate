  <title class="title">Overview of the southern part of the original distribution range of the El Oro parakeet in southwestern Ecuador.</title>
  <p class="p">The extent of the range was inferred from the altitudinal band between 600â€“1100 m (grey), where the El Oro parakeet was discovered. Forest fragments in the area are depicted in green. The four study areas of Cerro Azul, Buenaventura, Nalacapa and Guayacan are indicated by the dashed outlines, with the Buenaventura reserve (solid black outline) being the only protected site within the area.</p>
