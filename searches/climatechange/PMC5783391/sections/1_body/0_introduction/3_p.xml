<p class="p">The intensity of an upslope range shift is not only determined by climatic variables, but also by topographical characteristics of the area. In the case of environmental barriers such as mountain tops or fragmented habitat, a range shift might not be possible as suitable habitat is no longer available. In this case, a species has to respond to warming temperatures within the same habitat. In order to prevent local extinction due to heat stress, a species will need to adapt physiologically to increasingly warmer temperatures and expand its temperature niche. A species’ potential to adapt genetically or through phenotypic plasticity to environmental changes is largely determined by its genetic diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The genetic diversity of a species, in turn, depends strongly on the population size and the level of gene flow between sub-populations in different areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Therefore, sufficient habitat and connectivity among sub-populations are crucial to facilitate migration and gene flow and thereby ensure a high level of genetic diversity. As a result, conservation efforts that aim to preserve habitat and restore connectivity are required to maintain the potential of cloud forest species to adapt to warming temperatures.
