<p class="p">The cloud forests in the global biodiversity hotspot of Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena on the western slopes of the Andes are the habitat of more than 400 endemic animal species [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Ongoing deforestation strongly threatens these species with climate change being an additional threat, leading to further habitat loss and reduction of connectivity [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Previous studies have broken important new ground by modelling climate change effects on species richness and distribution in the hotspot [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, thus far, we lack detailed information about the future temperature-induced upslope shift at the species level and at the southern edge of the hotspot. This information is essential because high-resolution data on range shifts are necessary not only to quantify a species’ vulnerability to warming temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], but also to examine the availability and configuration of suitable habitat in the projected range. These data can help to design conservation measures that aim at ensuring habitat availability and connectivity for cloud forest species in view of ongoing climate change.
