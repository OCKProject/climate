<p class="p">We quantify the upslope range shift by assessing the temperature niche of the El Oro parakeet and projecting it for four different climate change scenarios as described by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Then, we transfer the projected ranges to a map of forest fragments in the El Oro parakeet’s distribution range. We hypothesize that habitat availability differs between climate change scenarios, depending on the amount of the range shift. We expect the differences in habitat availability to be predictable, with an inverse relationship between habitat availability and the intensity of climate change.
