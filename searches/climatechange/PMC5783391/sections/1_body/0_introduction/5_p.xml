<p class="p">Here we analyze past and project potential future temperature-induced upslope shifts in the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot and the consequences that such shifts might have on the availability of habitat. To assess the generality of our results, we investigate the relationship between altitudinal shift and forest cover at four different sites in southwestern Ecuador. We use the El Oro parakeet (
 <italic class="italic">Pyrrhura orcesi</italic>), which is endemic to the cloud forests in a narrow range in the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot and heavily threatened by forest loss, as a model species for this study. There is evidence that the species has shifted its range uphill in the decades since its discovery in the 1980s [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. As the El Oro parakeets are susceptible to forest fragmentation [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], the survival of the species hinges on the availability of forest habitat within its range. The El Oro parakeet is a mobile species, but presumably not very temperature-sensitive. The range of the El Oro parakeet overlaps with the ranges of more than 350 bird species, of which 15 are endangered and 34 locally endemic [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. We assume that the results gained for the El Oro parakeet and the conservation implications derived from these results are also applicable and of high relevance for many other cloud forest species, including such species which are less mobile, like amphibians [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] or dispersal-limited bird species. Therefore, we consider it an appropriate umbrella species for assessing the upslope shift in the southern part of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot.
