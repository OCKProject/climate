<p class="p">Tropical species typically have narrow temperature niches and low tolerance to temperature changes [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. To avoid the negative impacts of rising temperatures, species may evade into cooler surroundings. Previous work has demonstrated behavioral responses of tropical species to global warming, like poleward or upslope shifts in animal and plant communities as a consequence of increasing temperatures in their original ranges [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In tropical montane cloud forests, species may shift within their specific temperature niche uphill at a speed of up to 70 m per decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], while the speed of the shift lags behind temperature increase [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. In comparison to species in temperate zones, which have been observed to shift their ranges at a rate of 4 to 30 m per decade [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], tropical cloud forest species thus seem to be much more strongly affected by warming temperatures. Since tropical mountains are centers of endemism and species often have only narrow altitudinal ranges, upslope range shifts can result in a complete exchange of the ecosystem in lower zones, reductions in the size of the distribution range and extinction of species occurring near mountain tops [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In the case where an upslope range shift is impossible and no other suitable habitat is available, tropical cloud forest ecosystems may be at risk of severe losses in biodiversity.
