 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Their extreme altitudinal zonation of microhabitats combined with narrow species ranges make them centers of endemism [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Tropical montane cloud forests depend on frequent immersion in the cloudbank, creating a cool, moist environment with low direct sunlight and low evapotranspiration [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Anthropogenic climate change has the potential to result in an uphill shift of the cloudbank, thus leaving lower elevation zones in hotter and drier conditions [
