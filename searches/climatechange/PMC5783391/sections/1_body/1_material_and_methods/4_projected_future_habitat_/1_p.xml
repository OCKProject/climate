<p class="p">We quantified changes in the geographical range and habitat availability for the El Oro parakeet over an area covering about one-third of the species’ distribution range. To this end, we projected the original range (600–1100 m) and the expected ranges for the years 2050 and 2100 to a map of forest fragments in ArcMap 10.2. The map was created using satellite images (RapidEye, Blackbridge, Germany) with a resolution of 5 m from the years 2010 and 2013 as a template; forested habitats ≥ 0.1 ha were mapped manually in ArcMap 10.2. Prior to the analysis, we identified four study areas Cerro Azul (CA), Buenaventura (BV), Nalacapa (NA) and Guayacan (GY,

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) depended on the availability of forest maps. Within each of the four areas, we measured the size of the original altitudinal range and the projected ranges for 2050 and 2100 under the four RCP scenarios. We assumed the range of the El Oro parakeet to span 500 m in altitude, implying a parallel shift of the lower and upper range boundaries. Additionally, we measured the extent of forested habitat within the original and projected ranges. To assess differences in the connectivity between the forest fragments, we measured the shortest distances between forest fragments within the original and projected ranges using the “Near” tool of ArcMap 10.2. We based this analysis on the assumption that no changes in the extent and distribution of forest cover would occur until the year 2100. This assumption relies on forest cover not being limited by climate, but by anthropogenic land use. We acknowledge that this assumption is simplistic and most likely not plausible considering the high deforestation rates in the area; however, it yields information about the order of magnitude in the changes in habitat availability that is to be expected under the different climate change scenarios.
