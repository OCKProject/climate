<p class="p">In the linear regression of temperature anomalies and mean altitudes in a given year, we obtained an estimate for the temperature niche of the parakeets. To predict the geographic extent of the El Oro parakeetsâ€™ distribution range under different climate change scenarios, we projected the temperature niche to the Atlas subset models for each of the four RCPs.</p>
