<p class="p">In 2002, the birds occurred at an altitude of 998 ± 36 m (mean ± standard deviation; n = 353 observations), while in 2011 (n = 70 observations) and 2012 (n = 1063 observations) we found them at 1061 ± 63 m and 1081 ± 23 m, respectively (

The mean altitudes for 2002, 2011, and 2012 were approximately equal to the average of the extreme values (2002: 1020 m; 2011: 1050 m; 2012: 1075 m). We assessed whether climate variability influenced the altitude of records of the El Oro parakeets over time using simple statistical models. To quantify the shift in their altitudinal range, we fitted a simple linear model of the altitude as a function of time (altitude = altitude

 <sub class="sub">Year</sub>), using the means of the observed altitudes for the years 2002, 2011 and 2012. Additionally, we included the means of the altitudinal ranges for the years 1985 and 1986 (850 m; [

A detailed analysis of the uncertainties of the model is beyond the scope of this paper. For the linear regression, we assumed that errors are independent, as well as normally and identically distributed. The least square estimate of this simple model resulted in an uphill movement of the distribution range of the El Oro parakeets of 8.5 m per year (
