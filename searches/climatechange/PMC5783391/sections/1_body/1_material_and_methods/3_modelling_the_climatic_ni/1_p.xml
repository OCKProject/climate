<p class="p">El Oro parakeets were observed by teams of 1â€“3 observers on 50 observation sites in the rainy season (December to July) of the years 2002, 2011 and 2012 in the Buenaventura reserve in elevations between 800 and 1300 m using consistent methods according to pre-established protocols (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]). Surveys were always done on multiple days. Each day, observations started at 06:30 and ended at 17:00. The 50 observation sites remained constant across the years. Observation sites were chosen based on openness and visibility (hilltops, look-out points, etc.). All observations of parakeets were recorded in an unlimited radius, with point counts at fixed time intervals. Fly-bys were counted, and the altitude and direction of flight noted and compared among observers. If a same-sized group was recorded by another observer in the direction of flight, it was not counted twice to avoid over-estimating the population. As our study was purely observatory and did not involve any handling or sampling of birds, no specific permission was required.
