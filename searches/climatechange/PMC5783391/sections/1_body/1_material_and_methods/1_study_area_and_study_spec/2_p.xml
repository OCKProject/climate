<p class="p">The distribution range of the El Oro parakeets is affected by intense deforestation. Up to 95% of the original forest cover in western Ecuador has already been logged and converted into cattle pasture [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The only protected site within the parakeets’ distribution range is the Buenaventura reserve near Piñas (S 3,655°, W 79,744°). This reserve covers an area of 2575 ha of secondary forests and abandoned cattle pastures in altitudes between 400 and 1450 m. Outside the reserve, remaining forest fragments are mostly small (&lt; 100 ha) and separated by large areas of open habitat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191773.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). As a result of the intense deforestation throughout its range, the population of the El Oro parakeet is declining rapidly. The population size is currently estimated at less than 1000 mature individuals [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Being frugivorous birds breeding in tree cavities, the El Oro parakeets rely heavily on a dense forest cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. However, the species is able to cope with a certain degree of forest fragmentation and can cross gaps of up to 600 m between forests [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The El Oro parakeet was discovered in the 1980s, when it occurred at an altitude of 600–1100 m, with one record from 1931 at 300 m [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Since then, the El Oro parakeets have continuously shifted their distribution range uphill: In 2003, they occurred mainly at 800–1300 m [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], while in 2016 they could occasionally be observed in altitudes as high as 1600 m [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. It has been hypothesized that the upslope shift could be attributed to increasingly warmer and drier conditions in the lower elevation zones [
