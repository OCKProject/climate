<p class="p">The simple linear regression suggests that between the years 1985–2015, El Oro parakeets shifted their range uphill by roughly 415 m per 1°C warming (Pearson’s product moment correlation: r = 0.862; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.1; null hypothesis: no correlation between altitude and year). While in 1985 they occurred at a mean altitude of 850 m, according to our model by 2015 they already moved uphill to 1110 m (
