<p class="p">The size of the geographical distribution range of the El Oro parakeets is projected to decrease within all of the four scenarios by the year 2100. Under the most optimistic scenario RCP2.6, the range contraction varied between 5% in Guayacan (GY) and 98% in Buenaventura (BV) of the original range. Under RCP4.5, the projected range decreased to 20% in Cerro Azul (CA) to 31% in BV, while no habitat remained in Nalacapa (NA) and GY. Under RCP6.0, the projected range shrank to 6% in CA to 9% in BV, with no habitat remaining in NA and GY. Under RCP8.5, the geographic range completely retracted from the four study areas (
