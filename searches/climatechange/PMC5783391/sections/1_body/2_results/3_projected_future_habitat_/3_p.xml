<p class="p">The change in connectivity between forest fragments showed no congruent pattern. In the range projected for 2100 under RCP2.6, the distance between fragments varied between 55% (NA) and 233% (GY) as compared to the original range. Under RCP4.5 the distances increased to 142% (CA) and 144% (BV). Under RCP6.0, the distances decreased in BV (11%), but increased largely in CA (667%;
