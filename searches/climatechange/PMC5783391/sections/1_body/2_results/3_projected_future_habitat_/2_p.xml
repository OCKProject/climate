<p class="p">The forested area within the projected ranges decreased more drastically than the range size. While in the range projected for 2100 under RCP2.6, the forested area decreased to between 7% (GY) and 45% (CA and BV) as compared to the extent in the original range, the forested area amounted to 7% (CA) to 9% (BV) of the original extent under RCP4.5. Under RCP6.0, the area covered by forest is projected to be more drastically reduced (7% in BV, no forest in the projected ranges in CA, NA, and GY;
