 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century: In 2050 and 2100, the parakeets’ niche occurred in the same altitude of 1110–1610 m (mean projected range ± 250 m). Under the RCP4.5 and RCP6.0 climate forcing scenarios, the shift was more pronounced (1270–1770 m in 2050 and 1450–1950 m in 2100 under RCP4.5; 1210–1710 m in 2050 and 1660–2160 m in 2100 under RCP6.0). Even though the RCP4.5 scenario implies smaller climate forcing in the long run than RCP6.0, the upslope shift under RCP4.5 was more obvious until the year 2050. The strongest considered climate forcing scenario (RCP8.5) yielded the most drastic projected upslope shift: By 2050, the distribution range would shift to an altitude of 1430–1930 m, reaching 2330–2830 m by 2100. The probability density, cumulative density, and survival function of the modelled altitudes under the four RCPs for the year 2100 are shown in
