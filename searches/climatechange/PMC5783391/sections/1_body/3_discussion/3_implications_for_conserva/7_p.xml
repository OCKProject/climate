<p class="p">To enable dispersal and gene flow for El Oro parakeets in the future and, with it, to prevent a possible population decline due to habitat loss, it is crucial to not only aim at restoring or facilitating connectivity in a horizontal direction between forests in the same altitudinal band. Additionally, the vertical connectivity between forests in different altitudes has to be taken into account in order to allow for movement of parakeets into higher zones. In view of the high biodiversity in the Tumbes-Choc√≥-Magdalena hotspot and the similar altitudinal change of the endemic Ecuadorian tapaculo, it seems likely that many other cloud forest species are affected by climate change and the related range shift. Considering the high number of over 350 co-occurring bird species, of which 15 are threatened and 34 locally endemic [

We hypothesize that many other cloud forest species, including less mobile species like understory birds and amphibians, will greatly benefit from conservation measures aimed at restoring horizontal and vertical connectivity for the El Oro parakeet.
