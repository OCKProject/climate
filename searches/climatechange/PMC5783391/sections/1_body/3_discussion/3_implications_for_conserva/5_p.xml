<p class="p">The future availability of forest in the range of the El Oro parakeet is difficult to project. We based the analysis of forest availability in the study areas on a map of forest fragments of the years 2010 and 2013, but did not account for future changes in forest cover. Considering the high deforestation rates throughout the Tumbes-Choc√≥-Magdalena hotspot within the last century [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], our assumption that forest cover remained constant until 2100 is very conservative. It is likely that forest cover changes differently in the four study areas within the next decades. In the protected Buenaventura reserve, intense reforestation programs are carried out, increasing the forested area significantly. The other three study areas are unprotected; there, forest cover is likely to be reduced in the future.
