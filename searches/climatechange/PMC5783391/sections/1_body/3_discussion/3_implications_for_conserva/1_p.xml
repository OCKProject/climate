 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Remarkably, in our study we found that the projected shift of the El Oro parakeets’ distribution range does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the range size. Depending on the topography of the terrain, under some climate change scenarios the range size increased with the upslope shift, at least on the short term. However, within all projected ranges the area covered by forests, which represent the habitat of the El Oro parakeets, drastically decreases with increasing elevation. This suggests that the disproportionally large decrease in forest availability by the year 2100 to, on average, 10% of the original extent compared to a decrease in range area to on average 15%, is a general phenomenon in the cloud forests of the southern Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot.
