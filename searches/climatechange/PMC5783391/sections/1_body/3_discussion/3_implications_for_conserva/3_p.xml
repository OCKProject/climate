<p class="p">The upslope shift of the El Oro parakeets changes the connectivity among populations. While the original range covered a continuous altitudinal band from Guayacan to the northern part of the range (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191773.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), this linkage will become interrupted between Guayacan and Buenaventura by the year 2050. It has been shown that low-elevation zones present a dispersal barrier for El Oro parakeets [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The elevation of the valley between the two regions is so low that it will restrict dispersal as the range shifts uphill. Gene flow between populations of the El Oro parakeet in Guayacan and in the northern part of the range therefore might become greatly reduced, leading to a reduction in genetic diversity, which inevitably presents a risk of extinction [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. By the year 2100, Guayacan and Nalacapa could become prime examples of extinction at a mountain top, not only of the El Oro parakeet, but also of other cloud forest species. Thus, the area of Guayacan and Nalacapa should be surveyed for the occurrence of endemic species, e.g. orchids or amphibians.
