<p class="p">We identified areas that could potentially be colonized by the El Oro parakeet in the next decades and investigated the configuration of forests therein. The overall pattern of drastic decrease in forest cover in the areas that might be colonized by the El Oro parakeets in the near future already requires action to be taken in order to provide the species with forested habitat. Andean trees and vegetation communities have been reported to move uphill at 25–35 m per decade in the course of climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Compared to the El Oro parakeets, which likely move uphill at a rate of 40–150 m per decade, the migration rate for trees lags behind. It has been shown that secondary forests and even abandoned cattle pastures have the potential to regain characteristics of old-growth forests within a few decades [
