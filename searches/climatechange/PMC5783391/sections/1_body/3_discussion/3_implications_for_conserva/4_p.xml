<p class="p">Apart from the reduction in connectivity due to topographic barriers, the unavailability of forested habitat might additionally contribute to disrupting linkages between populations. At higher altitudes, forest cover is greatly reduced. We did not detect a clear pattern in the change in connectivity between forest patches in the projected ranges. Although the configuration of forests is site-specific, the connectivity between forest patches is generally lower at higher elevations owing to the increasing ruggedness of the terrain. Thus, the increase in fragmentation accompanying the upslope shift of the range will likely influence gene flow, as even now populations are genetically structured by valleys [
