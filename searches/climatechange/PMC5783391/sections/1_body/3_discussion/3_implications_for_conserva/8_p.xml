<p class="p">Our study yields general information about the potential risks that montane species face driven by climate change. In mountain ecosystems worldwide, species are undergoing range shifts caused by climate change [e.g., 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Accompanying the upslope shift, a loss in range size can be aggravated by the disproportionally large decrease in suitable habitat and the arising barriers to connectivity. As a result, an upslope shift may cause drastic reductions in population size and genetic diversity, putting the long-term survival of montane species at risk. Our study provides a framework to assess the long-term persistence or extinction risk of mountain species in the face of increasing pressure from climate change.
