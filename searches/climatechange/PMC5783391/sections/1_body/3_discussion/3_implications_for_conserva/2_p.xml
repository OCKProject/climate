<p class="p">The available habitat shrinks more quickly than does range area. This has important implications for conservation: A species might actually be more threatened than assumed based on the analysis of the range size alone. Not considering the changes in habitat availability might underestimate a species’ extinction risk [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. After integrating projected changes in forest availability, the reassessment of the threat status of 800 Amazonian bird species resulted in an increase in the number of species qualifying as ‘threatened’ from 3% to 10% [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Accounting for changes in altitudinal ranges and forest cover combined for more than 800 endemic birds from tropical biodiversity hotspots produced a more striking result: 43% of the species were found to be more threatened than currently estimated by IUCN [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. To obtain a precise quantification of the extinction risk of the species of the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot, a similar approach should also be implemented.
