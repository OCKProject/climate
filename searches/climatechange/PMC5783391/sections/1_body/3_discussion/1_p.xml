<p class="p">We quantified the projected upslope shift in the El Oro parakeetâ€™s distribution range during this century for different climate change scenarios. Depending on the intensity of climate forcing and projected climate change, the predicted range shifts between 500 and 1700 m uphill by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Importantly, this shift is accompanied by a drastic loss in habitat for the species and for the ecosystem. Moreover, the shift will additionally disrupt connectivity between parakeet populations in different areas.
