<p class="p">Projecting the range shift of the El Oro parakeets in a correlative approach based purely on warming temperatures is, of course, only an approximated forecast of future changes in its distribution range. Several Andean bird species were found to migrate uphill only at 30% of the rate predicted by temperature increase as the single driver [

A speciesâ€™ response to climate change is likely not mediated by temperature alone; yet, biological mechanisms like physiological traits, phenotypic plasticity, local adaptations, species interactions, dispersal abilities, or habitat availability should also be taken into account when modeling future range shifts [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The above mentioned biological parameters may be able to mitigate or enhance the rate of the temperature-driven range shift [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Most of these data are lacking for the El Oro parakeets; thus, we only integrated habitat availability into the model. It is possible that the actual changes in the distribution range will differ slightly from our projection. However, we accounted for a substantial (albeit likely overconfident) range of uncertainty in the intensity of the shift by including the results of 25 to 42 single CMIP5 models for each RCP scenario into the analysis (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0191773.g004" class="xref">4</xref>). The projection of the upslope range shift is based on precious few observations. Importantly, the rate of the upslope shift is mainly influenced by the values for the altitudinal range in the years 1985 and 1986. These data, reported in [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], were obtained during two months of fieldwork across the entire geographical range of the El Oro parakeet, when the species was found only between 600 and 1100 m. Yet, based on a museum specimen collected at 300 m in 1939, it has been suggested that by the time of the discovery of the species, the El Oro parakeet was already undergoing an upslope shift in its distribution range [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Moreover, opportunistic observations of El Oro parakeets between the years 2013 and 2017 suggest that the statistical simulation produced reasonable results. The projection is, of course, an approximation, yet it provides a credible estimate of the potential magnitude of the shift that may be expected under distinct climate change scenarios.
