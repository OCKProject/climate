<p class="p">The upslope shift in the El Oro parakeets’ range is likely not induced by habitat loss and deterioration in lower elevations. Particularly in the Buenaventura reserve, forest quantity and quality in the lower zones increased largely within the last two decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Yet, the El Oro parakeets by now avoid the lower elevations, which even goes as far as to disrupt gene flow between populations on both sides of the valley [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Alternatively, the shift could also be caused by changes in food availability which may be temperature-sensitive, and may therefore be an indirect effect of the temperature increase. Previous studies have suggested that food availability might be partly responsible for altitudinal migrations of frugivorous birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. However, in the El Oro parakeets’ range, a similar upslope shift has been observed in an ecologically distinct species, the endangered and endemic Ecuadorian tapaculo (
 <italic class="italic">Scytalopus robbinsi</italic>). The Ecuadorian tapaculo is a dispersal-limited, insectivorous bird which seems to have undergone a 250 m upslope shift in its distribution range within the last 25 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The altitudinal shift of a similar magnitude among two ecologically distinct species suggests that the shift in the range of the El Oro parakeets is indeed driven by sensitivity to the temperature increase rather than to sensitivity to food availability, and is therefore a direct effect of warming temperatures. These parallel altitudinal shifts of threatened endemics suggest that our results may hold more generally for species in the Tumbes-Chocó-Magdalena hotspot.
