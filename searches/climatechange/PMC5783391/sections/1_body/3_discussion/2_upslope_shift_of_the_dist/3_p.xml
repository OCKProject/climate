<p class="p">All four climate change scenarios imply an altitudinal range shift of the El Oro parakeets by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century. Compared to the altitudinal range of 600â€“1100 m where the species was discovered [
 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], the birds are projected to shift their range uphill at a rate between 40 and 150 m per decade until the year 2100 following a temperature increase. This rate is roughly consistent with the range shifts that have been observed for endemic animal species on mountains in Madagascar and Indonesia [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Therefore, the range shift of the El Oro parakeets will likely exceed the projections under the RCP2.6 scenario and continue at least until the year 2100.
