<p class="p">Previous studies have identified temperature increase as the primary driver for species’ range shifts [

 <xref rid="pone.0191773.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Consistent with this interpretation, the El Oro parakeets are moving uphill as temperatures throughout its range are warming. Between the years 1985 and 2015, the species has shifted its range uphill at an average speed of roughly 90 m per decade, corresponding to a shift of approximately 420 m per 1°C warming. El Oro parakeets have been observed to seasonally migrate between the lower and higher areas in the Buenaventura reserve, which might be caused by a low tolerance to temperature changes. While El Oro parakeets can be observed in lower altitudes in the cooler dry season (August-November), in the warmer wet season they stay in higher and thus cooler zones. It is conceivable that this migration is linked to the seasonal temperature variation, causing the El Oro parakeets to follow the temperature gradient. This interpretation is consistent with our finding that temperature is already now affecting the movement of the El Oro parakeets.
