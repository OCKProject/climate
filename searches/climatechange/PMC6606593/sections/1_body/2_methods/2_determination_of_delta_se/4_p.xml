<p id="Par20" class="p">Sediment cores were dated through gamma-ray spectroscopy (
 <sup class="sup">137</sup>Cs isotope activity). Samples were measured individually in High Purity Germanium (HPGe) well detectors (Ortec GWL series, USA). Three time-horizons were determined from 
 <sup class="sup">137</sup>Cs activity, from bottom to top core: 1954 as the first occurrence related to the fallout from the atmospheric nuclear tests, 1964 as the first peak linked to the maximum fallouts from these tests and 1986 as second peak due to the Chernobyl accident

 </sup>. MARs were then calculated by the total mass of sediment deposited between each time-horizons divided by the time span between them.
