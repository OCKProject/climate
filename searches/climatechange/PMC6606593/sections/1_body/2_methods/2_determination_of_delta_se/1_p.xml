<p id="Par17" class="p">The coring sites in Lake Geneva were selected to form a longitudinal profile highlighting the spatial evolution of mass accumulation rates (MARs) with distance from the Rhône River delta. Sample locations were based upon a study that quantified spatial patterns of lake bed sedimentation in Lake Geneva between the late 19

 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century
