<p id="Par18" class="p">After collection, sediment cores were stored at 4 °C until they were split longitudinally in two halves using a Geotek core splitter (Geotek Ldt, UK). For each core, one half was wrapped in plastic and stored in a cold room as an archive, while the other half was sub-sampled at 1-cm resolution. Turbidites, which were identified in the sediment record based on changes in grain size and colour, were sampled separately.</p>
