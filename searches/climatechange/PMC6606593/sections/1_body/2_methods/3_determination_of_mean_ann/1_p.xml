 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>, main paper). These data were used to determine annual mean SSCs and suspended sediment loads (SSLs), and hence delivery rates, to Lake Geneva. Given diurnal and seasonal scales of discharge variation and hence suspended sediment concentration, annual mean SSCs needed to be weighted through a rating curve, also needed for the determination of SSLs. Continuous hourly mean discharges (Q) for the same station were matched with corresponding SSCs. Log-log Q-SSC rating curves were constructed for each year of measurement using least squares regression. As such curves are fit in log-log space, their use to estimates SSCs from continuous discharge measurements are biased and so we applied Monte Carlo simulation in log-log space to estimate 1000 SSCs for each hourly measure of Q, transform these into linear space and then take the average

 </sup>. Tests suggest that 1000 simulations was more than enough to obtain stable estimates of SSC. Hourly SSC values were averaged across the year to obtain annual mean SSC values. They were also combined with hourly Qs to obtain hourly loads. These were summed to obtain annual loads.
