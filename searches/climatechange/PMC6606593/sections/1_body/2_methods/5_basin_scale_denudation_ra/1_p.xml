 </sup>. Samples were taken from tributary streams of the Rh么ne river, and along the Rh么ne itself. Sediment fingerprinting was established through framework petrography, heavy mineral concentrations and bulk geochemistry of detrital sand, collected from tributary streams and along the Rh么ne river. The relative contribution of the various tributary basins on the bulk sediment budget of the Rh么ne river was accomplished through the Optquest algorithm, that allows the identification of the percentage contributions of end-member sources. This approach has been considered to best reproduce the observed in-stream sediment composition by minimizing the difference between simulated and observed composition
