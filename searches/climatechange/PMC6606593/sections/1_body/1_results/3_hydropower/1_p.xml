<p id="Par9" class="p">Initial interpretations might follow the classic model for highly impounded river basins and attribute the reduction in sedimentation rate in the delta, from the mid-1960s, to sediment storage behind dams. However, explaining the increase in sedimentation rate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) and the rising sediment loads in the 1980s and then again in the 2000s is more difficult given that no change in reservoir operation has occurred. Closer inspection of the suspended sediment concentration data showed that most of the increase was in July and August and that inter-annual variability in flux was related positively to ice melt in the basin

 </sup>. The effects of the rapid rise in temperature and ice melt from the mid-1980s should lead to greater amounts of glacially produced fine sediment

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) suggests that this climate warming signal (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) was able to propagate through the basin despite intense hydropower activity (Fig.
