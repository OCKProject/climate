<p id="Par10" class="p">Two primary reasons were identified for the presence of an ice-melt signal despite this being a basin heavily impacted by hydropower. The first was the distribution of dams, which are primarily located in the Penninics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). 
 <sup class="sup">10</sup>Be-based denudation rates were some of the highest for the Penninics (1.23 ± 0.71 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, where there is also significant ice cover (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). It is well established that glaciers are extremely efficient erosive agents
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>, and there is growing evidence that their ability to evacuate eroded sediment is increasing due to climate driven changes in glacial hydrograph shape
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>
 </sup>; but sediment fingerprinting and mixing modelling suggested that tributaries located in the North and the East (External massifs) of the catchment were generating more of the sediment transported by the Rhône river to Lake Geneva
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. Even though the External massifs had lower denudation rates (0.81 ± 0.39 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, only the western External massif basins were impounded (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) such that, as climate warmed and glacial sediment supply increased, at least some of the glacial signal would be able to reach the basin outlet.
