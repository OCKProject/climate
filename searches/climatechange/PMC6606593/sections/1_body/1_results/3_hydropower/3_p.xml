<p id="Par11" class="p">Second, many of the un-impounded Penninic and some of the External massif basins are also impacted by hydropower but with extracted water transferred laterally through tunnels to storage reservoirs in nearby valleys (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>, yellow). Given high rates of sediment production in glaciated basins

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup> and to avoid the abstraction of too much sediment, the intakes have small gravel and coarse sand settling ponds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The coarse-grained material (sand fractions and coarser) is temporarily stored in these settling ponds and only washload is transferred to storage in reservoirs. When full, the sediment from the intakes is flushed down the river, which can be many times a day during peak summer ice melt. Data about flushing frequency provided by the hydropower company and the analysis of these records for 6 representative Penninic basins (I, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) show that flushing frequency; (1) rose markedly from the 1970s through the 1980s to 1994 (Mann Kendall, p &lt; 0.05); (2) had no significant trend from 1995 to 2009 (Mann Kendall, at p = 0.05); after which there was a marked jump in the number of flushes per year (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>). The average number of flushes per year was significantly lower (t-test, p &lt; 0.05) for the period to 1986 (111 ± 17 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) than for 1987 to 2014 (188 ± 18 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> to 191 ± 18 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, see Methods for explanation). The greater flushing frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>) is seen in both increased sediment delivery to Lake Geneva (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,c</xref>) and accumulation rates in the lake (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) since 1987. Flushing maintains sediment connection to downstream reaches; calculations of sediment budgets suggested that despite more than 95% flow being removed from the river at intakes and routed towards the storage reservoirs through tunnels, approximately 25% of flushed sediment went into river and floodplain storage immediately downstream. The remaining 75% of this flushed material found its way further downstream, thus maintaining significant sediment flux to the Rhône River despite the abstraction of 95% of water

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>
 </sup>. This sediment connection would thus allow the climate impact on ice melt and sediment export (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>) to be propagated through the system (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,c</xref>) not least because greater ice melt means greater sediment load and hence an increased flushing frequency. Indeed, there was a correlation of 0.543 (Pearson’s 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between flushing frequency and suspended sediment load. This relationship is also aided by the Rhône straightening and dykes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), which have largely eliminated overbank flows and so floodplain sedimentation, allowing a stronger connection between delivery of sediment from upstream and the lake.
