 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), that ranges in altitude from 372 to 4’634 m a.s.l.

Given the altitudinal range of the basin, significant amounts of precipitation fall as snow in winter and there is

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The Alpine Rhône river has been subject to significant human impacts, notably over the last 150 years. Two major phases (1863–1894 and 1930–1960) of engineering transformed a 103 km length of the largely anastomosing-meandering main stem into a narrow single-thread channel within dykes. The Rhône and its main tributaries have been engineered to disconnect their main channels from their floodplains and to convey delivered water and sediment through to the delta. During the 20

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and, to increase water storage, hundreds of kilometres of inter-basin transfer tunnels were drilled. The basin is responsible for 0.44% of global hydropower potential, despite covering only 0.0041% of the global land surface. About 20% of the mean annual runoff goes into storage. The completion of the major phase of reservoir storage expansion in the 1960s was coincident with a slowing, and eventually a very slight reversal, of post Little Ice Age climate warming
