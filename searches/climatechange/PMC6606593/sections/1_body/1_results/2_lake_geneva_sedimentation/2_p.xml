<p id="Par7" class="p">Annual sediment loads followed the patterns for concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) from 1980 through to 2014. The trend to rising sediment load was significant through to 1994 (Mann Kendall, p &lt; 0.05) and declining load was significant 1995 to 2009 (Mann Kendall, p &lt; 0.05) after which there is a rapid rise to 2014 although this latter trend is not significant (Mann Kendal, at p = 0.05). The mean annual load for 1987–2014 was significantly higher than 1974–1986 (t-test, p &lt; 0.05). This increased load is attributable to increased concentration as there is no significant trend in mean annual discharge from 1982 (Mann Kendal, at p = 0.05) and the relationship between log discharge and log concentration steepens from 1987 (t-test,
