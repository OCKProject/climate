<p id="Par8" class="p">Data on within-river sediment mining activities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>) show a significant trend (Mann Kendall, p &lt; 0.05) in annual rates of sediment extraction for construction, combined gravel and sand, from when data begin (1989) through to 2014, and extraction rates are of a comparable magnitude to the estimated annual sediment load to Lake Geneva.
