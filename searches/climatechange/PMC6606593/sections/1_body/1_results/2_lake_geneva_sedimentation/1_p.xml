 </sup>. Mass accumulation rates along a transect from the Rhône River mouth to the distal sub-lacustrine delta (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) vary spatially and temporally (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Prior to 1964 and hydropower expansion, there was a clear proximal to distal reduction in mass accumulation rates in the delta. These fell significantly (t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for the period 1965 to 1986 whilst the proximal to distal gradient remained. From 1987 onwards, accumulation rates have increased significantly (t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) for all cores to values approaching, and in one case greater than, those pre impoundment. The basin-averaged temperature record (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) showed a significant increase (t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in mean annual temperature in the mid-1980s from 0.66 ± 0.49 °C to 1.87 ± 0.53 °C. The analysis of annual suspended sediment concentrations and sediment loads showed that the concentration of suspended sediment delivered to the lake (at G, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) trended upwards (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) from the 1970s through the 1980s to 1994 (Mann Kendall, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) before declining to 2009 (Mann Kendal, p &lt; 0.05), after which there is a rapid rise to 2014 although this latter trend is not significant (Mann Kendal, at p = 0.05). Analysis suggested a significant increase (t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in the slope of the relationship between log discharge and log concentration for 1987–2014 as compared with 1974–1986. The mean annual concentrations for 1987–2014 were significantly higher than 1974–1986 (t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05).
