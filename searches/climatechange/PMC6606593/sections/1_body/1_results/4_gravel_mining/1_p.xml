<p id="Par12" class="p">Whilst the above argument suggests that a heavily hydropower-modified system was able to maintain sediment connectivity to downstream, there is one final intriguing result. There is some evidence that sediment mining in the Alpine tributaries can impact downstream sediment load even in a basin of this size. Although extracted sediment includes fractions that would not be transported in suspension, the annual rate of sediment extraction was only slightly lower in magnitude that the loading of suspended sediment to Lake Geneva. Up until the late 2000s there was a negative relationship between sediment extraction rates and both mean annual sediment concentration (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.395, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 1989–2009) to Lake Geneva. We modelled this relationship for 1989-2009 using simple linear regression, used the model to predict concentrations and loads for the entire period for which we have extraction data, 1989–2014, and plotted the differences between modelled and observed extraction rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g,h</xref>). The negative relationships shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> for data until 2009 suggest that despite extraction data including both sand and gravel fractions, sand extraction was sufficient to be observed in downstream concentrations and loads of suspended material. However, from 2009 onwards, annual sediment concentrations and loads become independent of extraction rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and the residuals for both concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3g</xref>) and load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3h</xref>) are no longer distributed around zero but strongly positive, suggesting that extraction no longer influences them. There is a marked association with the flushing data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>). Sediment mining appears to be sufficient to reduce loading to Lake Geneva significantly until 2009 explaining the significant declines in load and concentration to between 1994 and 2009. However, extraction then appears to decouple from concentrations and loads and this was coincident with a significant economic downturn, and slow-down in construction rates, reported to begin from the end of 2008 by the Swiss sediment mining industry
