<p id="Par13" class="p">We conceptualise the above trends as showing how it is the combination of global (HCC-driven) and more local processes that make the kind of depositional record that we are seeing in the Anthropocene and that is likely to be the signal seen in stratigraphical studies of such deposits in the future
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. Whether the depositional signal of the last few decades that we address in this paper does indeed get incorporated into the permanent stratigraphic record will depend on its preservation potential. Whilst deposition rates in Lake Geneva are high close to the river mouth (cores TS-14, TS-8, TS-9, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), this is also the zone of an active canyon
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. Whilst the active canyon has not migrated over the last century
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>, it is likely to migrate over longer timescales. In the distal sub-lacustrine delta (cores TS-4, KK-1, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), away from the river mouth and the active canyon, where preservation potential is highest, depositional rates were substantially lower
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. In the zone of highest preservation potential, we identify a signal that for the moment can only be identified using micro-techniques (e.g. microscopes). However, this signal is also non-stationary, with a period of lower sedimentation until the mid-1980s, followed by a rise from the mid-1980s. A primary reason for this non-stationarity is that human impacts on sediment flux to the delta, whether related to global climate change (here increasing ice melt and sediment supply) or water and sediment management (here related to hydropower, river management and sediment extraction) are potentially opposing and evolve through time. On the one hand, evidence suggests that climate warming is driving glacial melt-driven sediment export
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. This can still be seen downstream of dams and intakes because the hydropower system operation is strongly coupled with climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>); as climate warming produces more ice melt, it also produces more sediment, and hence a greater need to flush intakes. On the other hand, until the economic shock of 2008, sediment extraction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3e</xref>) seemed to grow with sediment supply (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3f</xref>) and this was sufficient to cause lower concentrations and loads at the Lake during the 1990s and early 2000s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Sediment extraction has partly desensitised sediment delivery to the Lake from upstream climate warming. Yet, these relationships are also non-stationary. Here, an external economic shock slowed the growth in sediment extraction rates from 2009 onwards just as there was growing sediment export from glaciated parts of the basin. The result was a very rapid rise in sediment concentration and loading to the highest values on record (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b,c</xref>). Given the close relationship between ice melt and glacial sediment export
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>, it is likely that as the ice volume in the basin declines and a state of “peak water” is passed, here predicted for the 2030s to 2050s
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>, so annual sediment delivery will reduce. This process may also be reinforced by the progressive reduction in sediment availability in deglaciated zones as the landscape passes through its paraglacial phase
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. It is this combination of HCC with human impacts within the basin that can: (a) result in opposing tendencies; (b) make sediment delivery prone to external shocks; and (c) involve co-evolution of drivers (e.g. climate, human response) within the system.
