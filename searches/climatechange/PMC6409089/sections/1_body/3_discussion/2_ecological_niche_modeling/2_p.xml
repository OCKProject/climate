<p class="p">Results show that ecological resistance for the majority of species is similar in present and future conditions with the exception of 
 <italic class="italic">B. trifoliolata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E. aspera</italic> where the ecological resistance will increase in future conditions. Ecological resistance can reduce functional connectivity and gene flow between populations (
