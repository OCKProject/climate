<p class="p">In this study, we present nation-wise adaptation pathways for the global production of wheat, which is a staple crop worldwide. We developed adaptation pathways for the current major wheat-producing countries (China, India, the United States, Russia, France, Canada, Germany, Turkey, and Pakistan)

We employed multiple climate models to analyze the uncertainties of climate-change projections: MIROC-ESM

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. We also used available model ensemble runs because the natural variability of the climate system is another source of uncertainty in addition to model uncertainty

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>; three runs each from MPI-ESM-LR and CSIRO-Mk3-6-0 were employed. We used all models and ensemble runs (i.e., 7 projections) for analyzing uncertainties arising from climate-change projections, and we primarily used MIROC-ESM in other analyses.
