<p class="p">Without adaptation (i.e., Level 0 both for irrigation and crop variety), wheat yields will fall below the current level in most countries in the 21st century under the RCP8.5 scenario (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). This is common to all of the climate models and ensemble runs. We found that only a limited number of the adaptation sets could maintain wheat yield near the current level (yield change ≈ ± 10%); late implementation of adaptation leads to a large yield decrease, and early implementation leads to an unnecessary yield increase possibly linked with overinvestment (
