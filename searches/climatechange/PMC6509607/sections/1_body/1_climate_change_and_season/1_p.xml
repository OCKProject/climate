<p class="p">The latest report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that without substantial cuts in carbon dioxide emissions, the world will reach the threshold of 1.5°C warmer than preindustrial levels as early as in 2030. With 1.5°C warmer, some regions including South and Southeast Asia and Central Africa will experience an increase in flood hazard due to high flows.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref> The increasing flood risks are alarming, especially their impacts on vulnerable populations with low coping and adaptive capacities. In particular, floods can have long-run impacts on health which in turn deteriorate human capital, a key driver of sustainable development. Using the example of the recent floods in Kerala, India, we discuss the potential impacts of floods on childhood development and present immediate measures to reverse the potential damage.
