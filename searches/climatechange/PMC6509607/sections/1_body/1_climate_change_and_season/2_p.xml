<p class="p">During the monsoon season this year, India has experienced a particularly high amount of rainfall. The data from India Meteorological Department show that from 1 June to 20 August 2018, the amount of rainfall in Kerala increased by 40% compared with the normal trend.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref> The heavy rainfall on 8 August 2018 pressured Indian states in the south to open many dams due to the fear of water overflow. The discharge of excess water from the water reservoirs across Kerala state and its neighbouring states resulted in the worst flood in Kerala since 1924. As a result of prolonged heavy downpour and a series of unprecedented floods, it is estimated that over 483 people lost their lives
