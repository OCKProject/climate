<p class="p">Since India’s central government turned down international assistance for flood relief measures, there was a concern by Kerala state government that their pledge for rupees 20 billion (approximately US$285 million) for immediate aid may not be met.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref> Furthermore, in the postflood Kerala, given that much of the public funds will be directed to rebuild livelihoods, homes and infrastructure, interventions to reduce flood-induced undernutrition are unlikely to receive priority. Failing to address the increase of undernutrition prevalence however can seriously undermine India’s strive for the Sustainable Development Goals. With limited public resources to tackle undernutrition, the government will need to identify the vulnerable segment of the populations that urgently need interventions.
