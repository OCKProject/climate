Disruptions in food supply and contaminated water leading to diarrheal illness make children under 5 years of age the most susceptible to undernutrition. With almost three quarters of its population relying on agriculture for their livelihood, floods can destroy crop and livestock production threatening Indiaâ€™s household food security.
