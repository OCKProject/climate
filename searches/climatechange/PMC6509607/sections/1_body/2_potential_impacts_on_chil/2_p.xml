 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13 14</xref> In order to provide some scientific insight into the potential deteriorating impacts of floods on child health in Kerala, we exploit the Demographic and Health Survey data for India collected in 2015–2016 and climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia. The Standardized Precipitation and Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which combines information on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration due to temperature, is used to identify flood events. SPEI distribution over 2010–2016 by grid cells in India is presented in
