 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">figure 3</xref>, we further compare the likelihood of undernutrition by child’s sex, rural–urban residency, household wealth and mother’s literacy. While boys are generally more likely to be stunted or wasted than girls given their higher energy usage, our data show that when experiencing floods, girls are more vulnerable than boys to being stunted and being wasted. This is because when food is scarce, households may adopt gender-based discrimination in feeding practices. Poorer households generally have much higher likelihood of stunting and wasting but exposure to floods also increased the likelihood of stunting and wasting for children living in a household in the middle and high wealth tertile. Likewise, children living with illiterate mothers are particularly vulnerable to stunting, and flood exposure further exacerbates this disadvantage. On the other hand, exposure to floods increases the likelihood of wasting for children of illiterate and literate mothers in a similar magnitude (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">figure 4</xref>). Wasting represents acute malnutrition, and it is plausible that the negative impact of floods on nutritional status is so strong that even literate mothers did not have enough time and resources to mitigate the risk of her child becoming wasted. Finally, we find that exposure to floods increases the likelihood of wasting for children living in the rural area.
