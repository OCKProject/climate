<p class="p">Our data analysis shows that exposure to floods can indeed exacerbate malnutrition in Kerala. While there is no regional differences in the probability of stunting in normal time, we find that accumulative exposure to abnormally wet conditions over the childâ€™s lifetime up to aged 5 increased the odds of stunting by 18% for children living in the southern region, and 7% for children living in the Central and Eastern regions (95% confidence) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>). This finding suggests that Kerala is particularly vulnerable to flood-induced childhood stunting compared with other regions in India. We do not find evidence that recent exposure to abnormally wet conditions (during the latest 3 months prior to measurement) increased the overall likelihood of wasting in the south although this is the case for the north and central regions. Looking at exposure to extreme SPEI of population subgroups; however, we do find evidence that floods do exacerbate childhood wasting in the south as well (see figure 4).
