<p class="p">Focusing on the south of India where Kerala is located, we investigate the relationship between exposure to floods (measured as SPEI &gt;1.5) and the likelihood of being stunted and wasted for children aged under 5. Defined as height-for-age z scores more than 2 SD below the WHO Child Growth Standards median, stunting indicates chronic childhood malnutrition which impairs growth and development in children. Wasting is defined as weight-for-height z scores more than 2 SD below the WHO Child Growth Standards median and indicates acute weight loss over a short period of time. For the analysis of stunting, we consider climate during the childâ€™s life up until the time when the child was measured in the survey, whereas for the analysis of wasting, we consider exposure to floods during the latest 3 months before measurement. The effects of undernutrition are shown to be long-lasting and can influence health and socioeconomic outcomes in adulthood.
