<p class="p">It may also be that responses to climate in this geographically widespread species vary by genetic clade. Wood frogs are known to have undergone postglacial expansion into much of Canada from various refugia, and Lee‐Yaw, Irwin, and Green (
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) found evidence for two mtDNA clades, one originating in Wisconsin and expanding into the great lakes region, Alaska, and central and western Canada, and one originating in the Appalachians expanding into Maine and eastern Canada. Our observed differences in size and phenology changes do not match up to these mtDNA groupings (see fig. 6 in Lee‐Yaw et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), but future studies could examine variation in genetics, breeding, and phenology across the wood frog range to determine the relationship between these factors.
