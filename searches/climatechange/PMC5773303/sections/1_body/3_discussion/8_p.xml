<p class="p">One factor that may be responsible for the inconsistent trends of size and breeding changes is differences in population density leading to differences in competition across populations. High population density has been shown to have negative effects on growth in this species (Berven, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), and others have found that toads in Ontario increased in size in inverse proportion to density, but that size was unrelated to temperature (Green &amp; Middleton, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Changes in population density surely will contribute to changes in size, but the question remains whether these populations are undergoing long‐term trends in population density (becoming either more or less dense), and what is driving that trend. Without population density studies, it is impossible to answer this question, although data from Berven's long‐term (21 years) study in Michigan (Berven, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) could be analyzed with respect to the environmental factors considered here to help establish the relationship between climate, density, and size. Environmental conditions likely contribute to density by affecting resource availability, but density could also be impacted by changes in predator densities or human disturbance, so further studies on size changes of species should also consider factors related to population density when considering mechanisms for size changes.
