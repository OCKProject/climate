<p class="p">Our observation that breeding has shifted earlier over time, in conjunction with intermediate increases in number of FFD, is consistent with other observations showing earlier breeding in response to warmer temperatures (Blaustein et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), including a study on wood frogs from Michigan which showed a negative association between average winter daily maximum temperature and breeding date between 2006 and 2012 (Benard,

 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), indicating that temperature (here, FFD) and not precipitation is the main driver of phenology trends.
