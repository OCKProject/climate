<p class="p">Our results highlight the fact that while it is easy to infer causation from widely reported correlations between climate and size, the mechanisms behind observed size changes have yet to be identified. Ours is the first study to correlate breeding phenology and size of organisms with environmental variables (temperature, precipitation, number of frost‐free days) 
 <italic class="italic">before</italic> significant climate change, and then to test how changes in the strongest environmental predictor of these variables correlate with observed size changes. In addition, because climate (e.g., temperature and precipitation) does not vary across latitude in a simple way, large spatial‐scale analyses typical of macroecological studies are likely to miss variation that is important when assessing mechanisms; therefore, our statistical analyses and spatially explicit predictive maps generated from georeferenced natural history collection data and 10 km

Our results do not support the predictions that heat preservation, desiccation prevention, or food abundance alone are the mechanisms responsible for size changes in wood frogs, and we encourage further research in physiological ecology and population density changes with climate to better understand how body size and associated life history traits within and across populations may shift under climate change.
