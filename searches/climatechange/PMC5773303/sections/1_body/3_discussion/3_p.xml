<p class="p">We were unable to identify a single mechanism (heat preservation, minimization of water loss, food abundance) responsible for size change in wood frogs, due in part to the complex relationship between size and climate variables we observed. For example, our results suggest that male size may be driven by minimization of water loss when areas become drier (larger size), but that with no change or increase in precipitation, size is more strongly influenced by food abundance (larger with low to intermediate increased FFD) and heat preservation (smaller with very high increases in FFD). Notably, females responded to precipitation changes in the opposite direction as that predicted by the mechanism of minimizing water loss when FFD did not change. Instead of becoming larger in drier areas and smaller in wetter areas, females became smaller and larger, respectively. This may suggest that food abundance is instead the driving mechanism, as food abundance is ultimately influenced by changes in precipitation (more primary productivity in wetter areas, less in drier areas). This is supported by the larger female sizes observed with small increases in FFD, as predicted when food abundance is the driving mechanism of body size. However, with intermediate and high increases in FFD, females became larger with decreased precipitation but smaller with increased precipitation, indicating that food abundance is not the strongest predictor of size in these cases, and that instead, minimization of water loss may be the driving mechanism.</p>
