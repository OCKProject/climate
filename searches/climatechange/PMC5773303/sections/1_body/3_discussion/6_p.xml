<p class="p">Although we found a significant relationship between body size and climate variables prior to significant climate shifts, those relationships were weak (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = 0.396 and 0.087). This could be due, in part, to our limited samples at various points in the wood frog's range, as our samples were biased toward the eastern United States. In contrast, the relationship between breeding date and temperature (FFD) was stronger (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>
 <italic class="italic">m</italic> = 0.643) than that for size and temperature, and changes in breeding and frost‐free days from 1961 to 2000 were strongly correlated. While our general trends (body size changes concurrent with changes in climate variables) reflect widely observed patterns, our analyses are unique in making spatially explicit predictions of how body size and phenology are expected to change, based on observed correlations with climate variables prior to rapid climate change.
