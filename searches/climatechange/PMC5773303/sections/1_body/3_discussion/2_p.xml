<p class="p">As expected, size and Julian day of first collection (breeding) changed significantly across our two time periods. However, the climate factor most strongly associated with each of our response variables before onset of rapid climate warming did not maintain the same relationship after the onset of climate change. Additionally, the strongest climate predictor/s of size differed for males and females, and the relationship between size and climate variables was complex. Thus, when data from all locations were pooled in analyses, we found that both males and females were larger after 1960 compared to before, but examination of changes at fine spatial scales (10 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) revealed that size increased in some areas and decreased in others, depending on the specific temperature and precipitation changes. This is an important result because most studies do not examine species across such a large geographic range nor with spatially explicit estimates of climate or trait changes (but see Davenport &amp; Hossack, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Given that precipitation changes are expected to be difficult to predict (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), our results suggest that size changes of wood frogs may not be easy to anticipate and that caution should be used when ecologists and evolutionary biologists use “space‐for‐time” studies (Pickett, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>) where measures of a species’ traits at lower latitudes or elevations are considered representative of those under future projected climatic conditions.
