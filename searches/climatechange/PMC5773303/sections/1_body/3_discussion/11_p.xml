<p class="p">Similarly, while wood frog breeding is indeed explosive, with reports from the literature indicating that up to 80% of breeding occurring within 3 days, for example (Petranka &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Waldman, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>), the arrival of individuals at a breeding site may occur for many more days before actual breeding. While there is no indication in the literature that arrival before breeding varies across the range of this species, it is possible that first collection of wood frogs in a given year (or over many years) does not match up to actual onset of breeding, and thus, that our results are due to consistently earlier collection efforts over time. The possible influences of collection or observer bias on our results should not be dismissed, but our very large (&gt;1,200 observations) dataset spanning 100 years should be fairly robust to such factors, minimizing such bias.
