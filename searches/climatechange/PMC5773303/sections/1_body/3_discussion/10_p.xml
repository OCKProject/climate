<p class="p">As with all studies, possible observation error or collection bias should be considered when interpreting our results. For example, if there is inconsistent observer bias over time toward collecting individuals of a given size, or at a time of year when individuals of a certain size class are more likely to be found (Connette, Crawford, &amp; Peterman, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), body size of museum specimens may not be representative of sizes found in nature (Grant, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This could then be one reason why our results are inconsistent with predicted changes in size with environmental changes, so our data may in fact be missing a trend that actually exists.
