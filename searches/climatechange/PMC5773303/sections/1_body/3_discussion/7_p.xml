<p class="p">It should be noted that the correlation of size and phenology with climate variables prior to the onset of rapid climate warming does not necessarily indicate that climate is driving those trends. Both size and phenology are selected for by numerous factors which may themselves be influenced by or correlated with climate. One interpretation of our results could be that climate is not the main driver of body size in wood frogs, as the two were significantly correlated prior to 1960, but not after. If climate were the main driver, the relationship should hold true both before and after the onset of rapid climate warming. For phenology, the fact that we found a significant relationship between Julian date of first collection (breeding) and FFD in both time periods indicates that either the selective factor(s) acting on phenology are changing consistently with FFD or that FFD itself is indeed driving that trend.</p>
