<p class="p">Additionally, if climate is directly responsible for observed changes in size or phenology, then climate data from prior to the onset of rapid climate warming should determine the statistical relationship between climate and both size and phenology. That information could then be used to predict size and phenology changes across space and time. If observed patterns postclimate warming are in line with predictions, then climate is strongly implicated in directly causing these shifts. Alternatively, if recent observed shifts in size and phenology do not match predictions, then mechanisms other than climate, such as resource availability or quality, are likely more important than direct effects of climate change.</p>
