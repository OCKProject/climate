<p class="p">Documented size declines are often cited as reflections of biogeographical or macroecological patterns such as Bergmann's rule (warmer environments tend to be inhabited by smaller endothermic species than colder environments, Blackburn, Gaston, &amp; Loder, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Clauss, Dittmann, Muller, Meloro, &amp; Codron, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or James’ rule (within a given species, individuals in warmer environments are smaller than those in colder environments, James, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>). Additionally, many species are known to have decreased in size during past periods of climate warming (Finkel, Katz, Wright, Schofield, &amp; Falkowski, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Hadly, Kohn, Leonard, &amp; Wayne, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Smith, Betancourt, &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Smith, Hasiotis, Kraus, &amp; Woody, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) or in response to experimental warming of their environment (Chomsky, Kamenir, Hyams, Dubinsky, &amp; Chadwick‐Furman, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Hovenden et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; de Jong, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Stillwell &amp; Fox, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). While body size is certainly due to a number of selective factors such as evolutionary history and population density, among many others, these lines of evidence suggest that temperature, and its physiological effects on organisms, is one of the most important driving mechanisms behind observed size changes, and researchers have proposed that recent trends in size declines are due to temperature's influence on metabolism (Bickford, Howard, Ng, &amp; Sheridan, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), developmental rate (Gillooly, Brown, West, Savage, &amp; Charnov, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), or resource availability (Wikelski &amp; Thom, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). However, empirical patterns found in nature vary (Chamaille‐Jammes, Massot, Aragon, &amp; Clobert, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and there have been few empirical tests of whether observed changes in size and breeding phenology are due directly to climate changes.
