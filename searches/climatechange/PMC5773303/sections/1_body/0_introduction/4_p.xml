<p class="p">Determining the mechanisms influencing body size in wild populations over long time spans can be difficult, but any given mechanism will have predictable outcomes associated with observed climate changes. If the mechanism is heat preservation, for example, as proposed for Bergmann's rule, we would expect declines in body size with increased temperatures. If the mechanism is minimization of water loss or desiccation, we would expect size increases with decreased precipitation. Alternately, if the mechanism is food abundance or quality, we would expect increased size with increased feeding season length or primary productivity (Gardner etÂ al.,
