<p class="p">We present data on 1,264 sexually mature (484 gravid females and 780 males with nuptial pads) wood frog specimens, collected between 1901 and 2000, to determine spatial and temporal patterns of body size and breeding phenology (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33636-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). While there are many more available 
 <italic class="italic">L. sylvaticus</italic> specimens in museum collections than in our dataset, we limited our measurements to those which were sexually mature, and which had exact collection locality information, in order to perform spatially explicit analyses. We compared body size and Julian day of first collection (a proxy for breeding date), for two periods: 1901–1960 (body size 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 679; phenology 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 359) and 1961–2000 (body size 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 585; phenology 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 414) as there were insufficient sample sizes to analyze changes on a decade‐by‐decade basis (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33636-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). We chose this split because the decade spanning 1950–1960 is approximately when global climate begins to shift drastically in the historical record (Girvetz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Individuals were measured for snout–vent length (SVL) to the nearest 0.05 mm with digital calipers by a single researcher (JAS) to eliminate interindividual measurement variation (Bernal &amp; Clavijo, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Lee, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Date of collection was converted to Julian day to analyze phenology shifts. Because wood frogs have explosive breeding events, with reports showing up to 80% of breeding occurring within 3 days, for example (Petranka &amp; Thomas, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>; Waldman, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>), and because they are typically collected during the breeding season, we considered Julian day of collection to be synonymous with breeding events. Although we know of no study which has previously used collection date as a proxy for breeding date in frogs, collection date has been used to measure change in phenology for other taxa (Davis, Willis, Connolly, Kelly, &amp; Ellison, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Scharlemann, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Additionally, given that male and female wood frogs arrive at breeding sites within a few days of each other (Howard, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1980</xref>; Waldman, 
 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>), we believe collection date combined with natural history knowledge can be used as a proxy for breeding in this species. We identified some collections that were well outside of the breeding season (determined at any given latitude by amphibian field guides, natural history publications on this species, and our own experience in the field) so we visually inspected histograms and used k‐means clustering to identify two clusters of collection dates (breeding season and nonbreeding season) within each degree of latitude for which we had data. Dates separate from the breeding season cluster were removed from phenology analyses.
