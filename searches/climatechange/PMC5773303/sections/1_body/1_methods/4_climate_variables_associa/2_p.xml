<p class="p">We used data from 1901 to 1960 to determine whether FFD, precipitation, or their interaction (FFD:precipitation) best explains spatial patterns in body size and breeding date throughout the species’ range. To confirm our choice of cutoff date, we tested whether the relationship between climate variables and body size (female or male) or collection date varied with choice of cutoff date, comparing our model selection (described below) and coefficient values with 95% CI for eight different cutoff years (every 5 years from 1940 to 1980), and compared decadal coefficient estimates (1930, 1940, 1950, 1960, 1970, 1980) to our 1960 cutoff date estimates. We found no effect of choice of cutoff date on our results and no consistent trend in observations when compared on a decade‐by‐decade basis (Appendix

 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>), we analyzed male and female body size data separately. Data for both males and females were used together for phenology analysis as both sexes are known to arrive at breeding ponds within one to a few days of each other (Howard,
