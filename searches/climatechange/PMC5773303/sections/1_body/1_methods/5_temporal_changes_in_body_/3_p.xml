<p class="p">Given the lack of consistent sampling across time at all geographic locations, as is typical of natural history collections, this method allowed a more conservative estimate across the entire continental range for those areas that showed changes in body size and breeding phenology. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) in which the continuous predictor is a spatial variable (e.g., latitude) and the categorical predictor is pre‐ or post‐1960 is less preferred because we do not have equal sampling across latitudes, longitudes, or elevations (Figure

 <xref rid="ece33636-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1959</xref>), an uneven distribution of samples (e.g., among elevations and across latitudes) between pre‐ and post‐1960 would bias our results using an ANCOVA. Similar to our analyses with climate variables, we determined the sensitivity of our analyses to our cutoff date (1960), but found no strong differences in patterns based on choice of cutoff date, so we present here results only using our original cutoff date of 1960 (Appendix
