<p class="p">For pre‐1960 and post‐1960 data separately, we used a thin plate spline regression in which the response of SVL or Julian day was regressed against the latitude, longitude, and elevation of each data point, and we used 100 bootstrapped iterations to determine the mean body size or mean Julian day and 95% confidence intervals for pre‐ and post‐1960. Additionally, we used the bootstrapped data to determine the mean

We created predictive and spatially explicit maps of our two response variables pre‐ and post‐1960 using five arc‐minute resolution raster layers of latitude, longitude, and elevation, so that all areas within the species’ range had an estimated body size and breeding phenology value. We obtained 95% confidence intervals for each map as some geographic regions were more heavily sampled (e.g., Appalachia) and some were not sampled (e.g., areas in northwestern Canada) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Those geographic areas in which the confidence intervals pre‐ and post‐1960 did not overlap were determined to be significant areas of change, while areas in which the confidence intervals overlapped were considered equal (i.e., change equals zero).
