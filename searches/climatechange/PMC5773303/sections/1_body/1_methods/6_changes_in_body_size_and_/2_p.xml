<p class="p">We used a general least‐squares model with an exponential spatial correlation structure to determine the relationship between the change in body size or Julian day and changes in climate across our two study periods. First, we created a dataset of 484 randomly distributed points (equivalent to our smallest dataset, female body size). Next, we used those data points to extract the spatially explicit data on mean change in body size (males and females) and Julian day, as well as the two climate variables. Both fixed effects were adjusted such that the data were proportional to the pre‐1960 levels (e.g., Δ precipitation/pre‐1960 precipitation). We weighted each response (female size, male size, Julian day) by its pooled standard error (i.e., areas with low pooled standard error were weighted more than areas with high pooled standard error), and fit each of our three models using maximum likelihood. We determined significance of each fixed effect by examining 95% confidence intervals of averaged models. Because our responses did not show a linear relationship with our fixed effects, we fit both fixed effects as second‐order polynomials and tested all combinations of our fixed effects for all responses (linear terms were always included when quadratic terms were included).</p>
