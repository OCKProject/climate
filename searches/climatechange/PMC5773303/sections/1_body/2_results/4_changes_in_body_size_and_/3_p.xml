<p class="p">Changes in male body size were significantly explained by the second‐order polynomial of FFD and precipitation (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33636-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Areas which were drier (red dotted line, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b) saw males increase in size, regardless of the change in FFD, but the greatest size increases occurred in areas with median levels of proportional changes in FFD (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Areas with no change in precipitation (thin gray line, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b) also saw males increase in size, except in areas with the highest proportional increase in FFD, where males decreased in size. Areas with increases in precipitation (blue dashed line, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b) saw males increase in size only when there was also an intermediate change in proportional FFD, and decrease in areas where there was a very low or very high level of change in proportional FFD (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Thus, males were larger in areas that were drier, areas with no change in precipitation and low to intermediate increases in FFD, and areas that were wetter with an intermediate increase in FFD. Males were smaller in areas with very high proportional increases in FFD that also had zero or positive changes in precipitation, as well as in areas that were wetter with very low increases in number of FFD.
