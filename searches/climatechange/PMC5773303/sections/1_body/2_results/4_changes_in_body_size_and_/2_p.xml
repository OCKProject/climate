<p class="p">We found that the variation in change in female body size was dependent on FFD, precipitation, and their interaction (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33636-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). In areas with no proportional change in FFD (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a, red dotted line), female body size decreased in areas which also became drier (proportional change in precipitation &lt; 0; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a) or had small proportional increases in precipitation, but female body size increased in areas where proportional increases in precipitation were high. In areas with an intermediate increase in FFD, females always became larger regardless of precipitation change (thin gray line, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). In areas with high proportional increases in FFD (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a, blue dashed line), female body size increased in areas which also became drier (proportional change in precipitation &lt; 0; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33636-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a) or had small proportional increases in precipitation, but decreased in areas with high proportional increases in precipitation. Thus, females were larger in areas with small increases in FFD regardless of precipitation, as well as in areas with intermediate and high increases in FFD that also became drier or experienced only small increases in precipitation. Females became smaller in areas with no change in FFD that also were drier or only experienced small increases in precipitation, and in areas that experienced relatively large increases in both FFD and precipitation.
