<p class="p">As a result, there is clear room for improvement. Our dataset included about 350 IAS (including a large majority of well‐known invaders), but there are other IAS occurring worldwide, which should be studied as well. In addition, our review is not exhaustive (e.g., non‐English language studies, studies conducted in 2017), and the studies considered here represent only a sample of the literature on this topic. Studies that explicitly focused on particular species without mentioning higher taxa (e.g., plant, vertebrate, invertebrate, alga, bacteri, virus, microorganism fungi) within their title, keywords, or abstract were definitely to be missed by our search terms. To be inclusive, our search string should have omitted higher taxa information, and this result in more than 18,000 publications. Such a large number of studies would have been difficult to screen, and thus, we focused the analyses on a sample of the literature and did not aim to be exhaustive.</p>
