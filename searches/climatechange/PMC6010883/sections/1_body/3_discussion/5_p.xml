<p class="p">In small island ecosystems, we might expect a decrease in predicted range sizes due to ocean barriers. Yet in Hawaii, we observed a clear increase of SRC (Vorsino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The authors of this study argued that given its limited latitudinal distribution, plant species need to migrate to upper elevation habitats to find temperature equivalent zones, which is the case for almost two‐thirds of the studied plants, except for plants that already occupied upper elevation wet forest habitats, which explain their predicted decrease in range sizes. In contrast, invertebrates (especially molluscs) and diseases were predicted to increase in range at large spatial scales and to decrease at smaller scales. However, given the small sample size of case studies at local scales, we recommend extreme caution in drawing conclusions at this scale. Overall, the small sample size prevents us from disentangling the scale effects from other conflated factors such as island versus mainland or taxonomic groups.
