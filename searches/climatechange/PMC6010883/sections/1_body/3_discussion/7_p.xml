<p class="p">While some conclusions could be drawn from our findings, it is important to emphasize certain gaps and biases. First, only temperature and precipitation changes were generally considered in modeling studies (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34098-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). The direct effects of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> itself have not been incorporated into the predictions, despite the strong influence this may have on plant's invasiveness. For instance, other studies have shown that elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> can increase productivity, competitiveness, and invasion success of plants relative to native species (Dukes,

 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The effects of land‐use type were considered in only 134 case studies, while it is known to have a strong effect on IAS distributions (Chytrý et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and to increase invasibility (Mattingly &amp; Orrock, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We found only one study that explicitly explored the combined effects of propagule pressure and climate change, while a few others considered it indirectly through road density (West et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) or a human influence index (Qin, Zhang, DiTommaso, Wang, &amp; Liang, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
