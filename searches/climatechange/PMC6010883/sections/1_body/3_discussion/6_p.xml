<p class="p">Another striking result is the contrast between the 
 <italic class="italic">large</italic> number of case studies that predicted ranges to decrease and the 
 <italic class="italic">small</italic> magnitude of the predicted decrease. By comparison, there were fewer case studies where ranges were predicted to increase, yet these had a 
 <italic class="italic">greater</italic> magnitude (see methods for details). For example, while most case studies revealed a potential decrease in range size for plants, the magnitude of such decreases is only âˆ’21% (predicted increase +31%), revealing a worrying opportunity of known invaders currently limited by climate conditions to expand in the future. Yet, the potential increase could be overestimated because studies mostly considered climate as the only limiting factor for species distribution (without considering available resources, habitat, capacity to invade those new areas). In contrast, if the climate is not suitable, it is unlikely the species will survive except if the species is able to adapt. Hence, the extent of increase in range should be treated with more caution than a decrease.
