<p class="p">Given the tremendous ecological impacts of invasive species and recent concerns over the potential effects of climate change on their distributions, we urgently need to investigate these effects. We observed an increasing number of studies that investigate this issue, especially since 2009. The small number of studies before 2009 could be surprising as the introduction of MaxEnt, BioMod, and Climex occurred before this date (Phillips, Anderson, &amp; Schapire,

 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Yet, the release of multimodel datasets to explore future climate scenarios in 2007 as well as MaxEnt documentation and BioMod ensemble modeling in 2009 may have contributed to increase the visibility and use on such approaches.
