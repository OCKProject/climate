<p class="p">On the other hand, at smaller scales where most management actions are undertaken, many case studies predicted an increase in the range of plants. For instance, in certain countries such as the USA, Ireland, and China, studies predict that plants range sizes will increase. This might be due to the fact that climate is not a limiting factor at such scales, whereas other important yet potentially limiting factors such as land use, soils, and species interactions (Bradley &amp; Mustard,

For instance, in Ireland, increases in range sizes of aquatic plants were found with global climate models, with shifts toward northern parts of the islands. Yet, when the authors also included a regional model that encompassed land use and nutrient variables, the projected ranges decreased by more than twofold (Kelly, Leach, Cameron, Maggs, &amp; Reid,
