<p class="p">One of our key findings is that plant and vertebrate ranges are more frequently predicted to decrease than increase at large spatial scales. A potential explanation would be that the predicted decrease in range size is mainly due to oceans acting as barriers to species movements following climate change, especially in Europe and Australia because the predicted shifts in range due to climate change are generally poleward (Parmesan &amp; Yohe, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). For instance, vertebrates studied here are bias toward mammals that are mostly problematic in Europe and Australia, where the suitable conditions are predicted to shift at higher latitudes (Bellard et al.,
