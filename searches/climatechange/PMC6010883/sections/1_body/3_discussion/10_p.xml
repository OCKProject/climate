<p class="p">Third, most modeling studies have only addressed the establishment and spread of IAS, but invasion processes include other stages like transport and introduction that are often neglected (Blackburn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). As there is evidence that rates of transport and introduction of IAS might increase with global change (Hellmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), it will be crucial to examine the effects of climate change over the entire invasion process (see, e.g., Early et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, mechanisms of invasion debt are also rarely considered or mentioned in such studies, while the timing to manage IAS might be crucial. Climate change will also affect native biodiversity, alien species resources, allelopathy, land use, and biotic interactions among species and ecosystems (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Oliver &amp; Morecroft, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Walther, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0082" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, the frameworks provided by Blackburn and colleagues regarding both the different stages of invasions and the multitude of impacts from individuals to ecosystems should be considered in future assessments (Blackburn et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) as well as future land use and biotic interactions.
