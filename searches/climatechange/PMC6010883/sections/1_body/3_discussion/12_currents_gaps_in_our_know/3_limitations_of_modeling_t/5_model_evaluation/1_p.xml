<p class="p">A further challenge comes from the evaluation of model predictive performance. Current robustness of approaches is evaluated through metrics like the area under the receiver operating characteristic (known as AUC) or the true skill statistic (known as TSS) that have been highly criticized (Allouche, Tsoar, &amp; Kadmon, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Leroy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Lobo, Jiménez‐Valverde, &amp; Real,

 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0502" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). More attention should be given to the problem of evaluation, as this is a fundamental way to communicate about uncertainty. Specifically, in the case of biological invasions, we want to know whether models tend to over‐ or underestimate the risk posed by invaders (Márcia Barbosa, Real, Muñoz, &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). A potential solution lies in evaluating models with respect to biological knowledge (Mainali et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), interpret within the limits of observation data (Guillera‐Arroita et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lahoz‐Monfort, Guillera‐Arroita, &amp; Wintle, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and apply alternative metrics (Márcia Barbosa et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Developing such metrics will be highly valuable for managers and policymakers to establish prioritization of invaders and implement eradication programs. Another way to assess our capacity to predict invasion risk is to parameterize models based on historic data: predictions of such models can be compared to current actual ranges, hence giving an estimate of a model's accuracy (Jeschke &amp; Strayer,
