<p class="p">An additional shortcoming of many current studies is that predictions are made beyond the domain of parameter calibration. The inclusion of data from both the native and invaded range has been recommended as a necessary step to overcome this challenge (Broennimann &amp; Guisan, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The application of process‐based models such as Climex is useful here, as they have better extrapolation potential than correlative models (Dormann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, their data requirements and assumptions may limit their applicability (Box

 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0088" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0501" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, but Climex seems more appropriate to deal with these novel climates. Overall, mapping novel environments is important to assess robustness of model outputs and guide users as to where predictions may be highly unreliable (Elith, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). For example, in the BioMod R platform, a “clamping mask” function allows users to map projections beyond the domain of parameter calibration.
