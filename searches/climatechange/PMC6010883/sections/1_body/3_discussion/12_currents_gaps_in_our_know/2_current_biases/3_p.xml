<p class="p">Invasion processes can take place over decades including transport and introduction, through establishment to spread, and all of these stages can be altered by climate change (Hellmann et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In addition, current approaches consider a homogeneous risk of invasion in the predicted suitable areas, but it is widely acknowledged that invader impacts depend on the local context (Pyšek et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The multiple impacts of invaders include homogenization of the biota, loss of genetic and functional diversity, and disturbance of ecosystem services, but currently available studies only focus on the distribution of invaders without assessing the impacts of future invasions. Therefore, future research should move to consider in more detail the potential impacts on native biodiversity and society.
