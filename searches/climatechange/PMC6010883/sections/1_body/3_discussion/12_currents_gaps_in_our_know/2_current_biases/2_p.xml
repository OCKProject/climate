<p class="p">Our analyses revealed a taxonomic bias toward plants and invertebrates, while invasive vertebrates are understudied although they are mainly responsible for past known extinctions worldwide (Bellard, Cassey et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Note that this bias could be due to our search terms that are most likely to capture studies with unknown invertebrates (in which invertebrates is cited in the title or keywords) than studies focusing on well‐known vertebrates (as the name of the species is mentioned, the term vertebrates might be useless). Our analyses also revealed that aquatic invaders are understudied in the context of climate change. This is also true for the broader context of biological invasions (Lowry et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). A significant number of case studies were conducted at the world scale. Yet, we still observed a strong geographic bias of the case studies toward Australia, Europe, South Africa, and the United States. This observation adds to previous analyses which also found geographic biases in research on biological invasions (Bellard &amp; Jeschke, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Lowry et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). As a result, most of the research on IAS and climate change is conducted on species that affect upper‐middle to high‐income countries. Yet, it is most likely that future hotspots of invasions might be located in newly industrialized and developing economies (see Dyer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref> for birds). Another potential bias comes from the lack of distinction between native and alien ranges where climate change effects can be divergent, as recently suggested for three invasive freshwater macrophytes that were predicted to increase in their alien range but decrease in their native range (Gillard, Thiebaut, Deleu, &amp; Leroy, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Although the most damaging impacts from some IAS occur on islands (Bellard, Rysman, Leroy, Claud, &amp; Mace, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and eradication programs are mainly implemented there (Jones et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), most of the studies analyzed here focused on mainland systems (except for Hawaii and New Zealand).
