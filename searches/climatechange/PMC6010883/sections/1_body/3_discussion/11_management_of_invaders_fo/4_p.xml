<p class="p">Modeling has been used to identify historical areas of species distribution (Maiorano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), to predict sites of potential presence for rare species (Raxworthy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>), and to support conservation planning and sanctuary selection for endangered species (Araújo, Cabeza, Thuiller, Hannah, &amp; Williams, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Leroy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We suggest that these approaches combined with local knowledge and studies can also inform policymakers and managers about future areas at risk from IAS. For instance, predictions over a short time scale (i.e
 <italic class="italic">.,</italic> for 2020) should be used to establish lists of invaders to be banned from countries and trade zones. At the moment, such lists are mainly established through current risk posed by invaders through knowledge of past introductions, spread, and impacts (Kumschick &amp; Richardson, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The establishment of a formal procedure that includes potential risk of invasions following climate change to determine invaders of high concern for management should be prioritized. Because shifting species’ ranges respect neither political borders nor protected areas, cooperation between countries will be crucial to fight further invasions (Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>).
