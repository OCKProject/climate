<p class="p">As invasion debts are likely to occur during invasion processes (Rouget et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), it is also necessary to consider not only past information but also future potential risk. The different kinds of results for plants and invertebrates between local (applied management measures) and large spatial scales (implementation of policies) suggest the need for caution. In particular, the small number of studies that focus on local as compared to large areas demands to investigate local spatial scales for areas of particular interest with approaches and techniques adapted for local‐scale studies (Pearson and Dawson
