<p class="p">Despite the uncertainties mentioned above, these results provide useful information for species management. It is now established that trade and transport of alien species are principal determinants of IAS distributions worldwide (Hulme, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Seebens, Gastner, &amp; Blasius, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), but climate change will alter those distributions in the future (Bellard etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our results here reaffirm the major role of climate change as a driver of IAS distribution in the future. Therefore, we need to consider these drivers jointly in order to tackle IAS issues and better inform management decisions.
