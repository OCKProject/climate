<p class="p">Second, our results indicate that climate change may sometimes offer opportunities to more efficiently manage IAS, in agreement with Bradley et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). We should take advantage of these opportunities by both inhibiting introductions to areas where climate might become suitable, and implementing eradication programs where climate might become unsuitable. Our findings suggest there will be major changes in current distributions of IAS, which will lead to significant modifications of biodiversity patterns through decline in native population, genetic and functional diversity, as we already observed during the past decades (Simberloff et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For instance, a decrease in range size accompanied by a shift of the species range into new areas can have devastating effects on the invaded communities. In addition, we also need to consider range shifts of native species, increasing numbers of extreme events, environmental changes, and trophic mismatches, which can make it easier for IAS to invade. A recent review showed that most native plant species will not be able to track suitable climate conditions fast enough (Corlett &amp; Westcott, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>); however, the movements of alien species are facilitated by humans, and thus, alien species might move faster than native species. Overall, our results imply that current IAS are unlikely to stop their spread and many will be able to invade new areas following climate change. Therefore, stringent policies and control should be implemented to mitigate future effects of invasions.
