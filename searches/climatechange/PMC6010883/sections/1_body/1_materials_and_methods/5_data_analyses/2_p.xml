<p class="p">Because most of the data extracted reported species range change, we mainly focus our analyses on this metric. In particular, we compared binary predictions of SRC predicted to increase or decrease for each taxonomic group and scale of the study. We also calculated the median of SRC predicted (resulting from climate change) for each taxonomic group separately considering the scale of the study. We show boxplots of SRC representing the median, and upper and lower “hinges” corresponding to the first and third quartiles of SRC within taxa. If all the data were easily available, we would have conducted a formal meta‐analysis to establish confidence limits around the average effect size of SRC and to test for consistency or lack of agreements of SRC predicted across taxon and region. However, this type of analyses would require information on mean SRC, sample size, and standard error (Koricheva &amp; Gurevitch,
