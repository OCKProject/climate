<p class="p">Developing our analyses involves three steps: (1) literature searches using search terms related to biological invasions and climate change, screening titles and abstracts to remove studies that address unrelated topics, and selecting studies that report the effects of at least one climate component on the studied species; (2) data collection: extracting and collecting information on the predicted size of the species range size change and, when available, the direction of range shifts; modeling approaches, species group studied, identity of the species, and variables projected; and (3) data analysis.
