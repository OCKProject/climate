<p class="p">For each study, we noted the general habitat of the organisms (i.e., terrestrial, freshwater, or marine) and the higher taxa to which they belong. The studies were mostly at a large spatial scale, but country assessments were biased toward upper‐middle and high‐income countries such as Australia, South Africa, United States, and European nations, which confirms previous bias observed in studies of biological invasions (Bellard &amp; Jeschke,

In addition, if multiple species were examined separately within the same article, they were treated as separate case studies, but we kept a record of the original study information. This procedure resulted in 423 case studies.
