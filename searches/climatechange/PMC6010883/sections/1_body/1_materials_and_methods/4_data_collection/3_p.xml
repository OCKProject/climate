<p class="p">We extracted the values estimated for these response variables when they were provided by the studies or contacted the author to get for this information. One commonly used measure is the species range change (SRC) value which is the difference between the predicted species range size in the future following climate change and the predicted species range size for the current period (under current climatic conditions). In most cases, only one SRC value was available in the study (e.g., for one IPCC scenario or averaged across multiple scenarios). We collected the percentage or the value of the SRC for each case study and also classified the SRCs into three qualitative categories: increase (SRC &gt; 0.5%), decrease (SRC ≤ 0.5%), or stable (SRC between −0.5% and 0.5%). Note that in spite of their critical importance, both the coordinate reference system and the correction for pixel surface are hardly ever indicated in studies. This is critical because the count of raw pixels without surface correction may result in inflated estimates of range increase at high latitudes, whereas estimates of range decrease at low latitudes might be too low. In addition, range size decreases can only have values between 0 and −100%, while potential increases in range have no upper limit, and therefore, potential increases can outweigh potential decreases.</p>
