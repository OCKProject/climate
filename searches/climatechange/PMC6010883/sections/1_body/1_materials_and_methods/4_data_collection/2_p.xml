<p class="p">For these 71 studies, we collected the following information: (1) methodological approaches based on distribution data only like species distribution models (called distribution models), on species process and/or dynamic population models based on growth rate for example (called process models) or approaches that combined both distribution and process like Climex (called here combined models); (2) biological level studied (i.e., individuals, population, species, community); (3) variables recorded (climate including temperature and precipitation, land use, or others); (4) closest date of predicted range; (5) species identity; (6) geographical scale of the study (i.e., world, large region—area &gt;1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, small region—between 1 million km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 50,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; local—&lt;50,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>); (7) spatial resolution; and (8) response variables examined for the effects of climate change (percentage of predicted change in species range size and/or change in suitability value, and predicted shift of distribution, number of generations, growth, or abundance).
