<p class="p">After a careful screening of titles and abstracts, we removed those articles that addressed unrelated topics. Of the 155 remaining studies, we selected papers that met all the following criteria: They evaluated the impact of at least one climate component (temperature, precipitation, or extreme events) on IAS range size or area distribution and they predicted future effects of climate change (â‰¥year 2020). This resulted in 71 studies (see Table 
 <xref rid="ece34098-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for detailed references). Given the many ways that such studies are reported, any set of search terms will only be able to identify a sample of studies and so this dataset should not be considered exhaustive (see 
 <xref rid="ece34098-sec-0004" ref-type="sec" class="xref">discussion</xref> section for details).
