<p class="p">On 23 February 2016, we searched the ISI Web of Science database for articles that examine the impact of climate change on biological invasions through modeling approaches using a combination of search terms for biological invasions and climate change. We used a range of terms related to IAS (taxonomic and invasion terms) and climate variables. The specific search term was as follows: ((invasi*) OR (invader) OR (non‐native) OR (exotic) OR (alien) OR (non‐indigenous) OR (introduced) OR (naturalised species) OR (naturalized species) OR (biological invasion*)) AND ((plant) OR (invertebrate) OR (vertebrate) OR (alga*) OR (bacteri*) OR (virus) OR (microorganism) OR (fung*)) AND ((climate change) OR (global warming) OR (temperature) OR (precipitation) OR (extreme event*) OR (carbon dioxide) OR (CO2)). We then refined our search to select only articles and proceedings papers that are related to biology. This search resulted in 6,911 articles.</p>
