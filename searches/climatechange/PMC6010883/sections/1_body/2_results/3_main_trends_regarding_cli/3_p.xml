<p class="p">We also analyzed the SRC values that were predicted for each case study. At the world scale, we found that on average species predicted to decrease were projected to do so by −24%, whereas species predicted to increase in range were projected to do so by +35%. Median values of decrease in range were −20% and increase of +24%. Plants showed the same trend with predicted increases higher than decreases at world (+31% vs. −21%) and smaller regions (+11% vs. −2%). Regarding world‐scale studies, we also found predicted increases in range to be higher than decreases for invertebrates (+32% vs. −4%), especially for molluscs (+22% vs. −1%) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34098-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In contrast, the predicted decreases in range for vertebrates were higher in magnitude than the predicted increases (+15% vs. −23%), although the results for mammals (+14% vs. −16%) were similar in magnitude. Similarly, there were higher predicted decreases than increases in range for diseases (−23% vs. +13%). In contrast, for the large region, plant range sizes were predicted to decrease more than to increase (−32% vs. +8%). For the small region and local scales, we found similar results for plants and invertebrates, with a larger predicted increase in range than decrease. However, upper ranges values of invertebrates and plants at local scale could be mainly due to strong outliers.
