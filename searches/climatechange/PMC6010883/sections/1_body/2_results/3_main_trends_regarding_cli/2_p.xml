<p class="p">More case studies predicted a decrease in IAS range following climate change (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 233) than an increase (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 145), while few studies predicted no change (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34098-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="ece34098-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). This trend was particularly marked for studies at world and large region scales, and for studies of plants and vertebrates. Specifically, the number of case studies for plants or vertebrates that predicted a decrease in range is more than three or two times, respectively, the number of case studies predicting an increase of species range size. There was an opposite trend for invertebrates (especially arthropods and molluscs) and diseases. Indeed, a larger number of case studies predicted range expansions following climate change at regional scale (sample sizes were low for diseases, though) than contractions. At the small region scale, we found opposite results for invertebrates and plants as compared to larger scales. Here, the majority of case studies on plants predicted an increase in range following climate change, and those for invertebrates predicted a decrease.
