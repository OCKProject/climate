<p class="p">Focusing on plants, we found that most plant ranges are predicted to decrease at the world and large spatial scales. This is particularly true for Australia and South Africa (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34098-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>A). At smaller scales, we observed a larger number of case studies that predicted an increase in plant range size, especially in Ireland and Hawaii. We also explored if differences between studies in predicting decreases versus increases in ranges were related to approaches specific to the studies (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34098-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>B). We might expect that approaches based on distribution only are more likely to overestimate the risk of invasions, as they assume species survival without considering variation in phenology or growth rate. Yet we found that results were similar across approaches, with both approaches showing a larger number of case studies predicted to decrease in range at large spatial scales. However, note that the strong bias toward the use of distribution models means that the comparison is rather weak.
