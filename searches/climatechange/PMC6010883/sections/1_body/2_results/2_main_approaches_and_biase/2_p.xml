<p class="p">In total, we found 71 modeling studies that investigated the future effects of climate change on IAS distributions. The number of these studies has increased over the last 10 years (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34098-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). Most studies rely on species distribution models only (using MaxEnt or ensemble modeling through the BioMod platform,
