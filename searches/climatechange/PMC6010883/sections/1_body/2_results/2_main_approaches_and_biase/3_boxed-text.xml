     <p class="p">MaxEnt is a correlative approach that uses presence of background (i.e., species occurrences and environmental data such as climate), but not species absence data to estimate the association between species and environmental data based on the principle of 
      <italic class="italic">max</italic>imum 
      <italic class="italic">ent</italic>ropy (Phillips et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The parameters in MaxEnt have no a priori defined ecological meaning and processes are implicit, which is in contrast to semi‐process‐based models such as Climex with explicit assumptions about mechanisms (Dormann et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). MaxEnt relies on different types of relationships (linear, quadratic, product, threshold) to link species data to environmental predictors (Phillips et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). This approach is known to perform relatively well, especially for small sample sizes (Elith et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and can be applied to a wide range of species, including those with limited data. However, as for all correlative approaches, MaxEnt has potentially unrealistic extrapolation capacity (Dormann et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which may be a weakness in estimating current and future potential invasive ranges.

     <p class="p">Climex is a simplified dynamic model to simulate the mechanisms affecting geographic distributions at short time spans (days or weeks). Climex is based on species known geographic distributions, abundances, phenology, and climatic data (temperature, moisture, and light) and can be tuned on the basis of species known ecophysiology. This allows determination of the relative abundance and annual growth during the favorable season (see Kriticos et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>, for a full description). The assumptions underlying Climex are biologically more realistic and have more potential for extrapolation in novel environments (e.g., future climates or uninvaded areas) and for modeling complex disease‐host range distributions than correlative distribution models. Climex includes growth indices, stress indices, and constraints to persistence that cover the major mechanisms by which terrestrial species respond to their environments. Yet, this approach requires more knowledge about the species being modeled, such as abundance data or ecophysiological knowledge, which may limit its applicability for species with no such data.

  <title class="title">Ensemble approaches</title>

   <list list-type="bullet" id="ece34098-list-0003" class="list">
    <list-item class="list-item">
     <p class="p">The ensemble modeling approach consists of producing multiple realizations of predictions (usually by combining multiple model classes with multiple sets of initial conditions, parameterizations, and scenarios), from which a consensus can be derived (e.g., average trend), and, most importantly, uncertainties can be quantified (Araújo &amp; New, 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The rationale behind ensemble modeling is that identifying the best model in a given situation (e.g., current data) gives no certainty that this model will adequately represent new observations (e.g., future projections), which is specifically the case for extrapolations to novel environments. Ensemble modeling allows accounting for spatially explicit uncertainties in extrapolations by applying methods from information gap decision theory (Kujala, Burgman, &amp; Moilanen, 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) to guide management decisions. Yet, ensemble modeling based on correlative approaches is subject to a number of limitations that have been extensively discussed and include difficulties due to biotic interactions (Wisz et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0089" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) or dispersal abilities (Engler et al., 
      <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>).
