<p class="p">Climate change is also expected to alter invasion processes. For instance, a higher frequency of extreme weather and the consequent opening of shipping lanes in the Arctic (Miller &amp; Ruiz, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) may facilitate transport of alien species, sometimes with dramatic impacts on ecosystems and species of conservation concern. Climate change is additionally expected to alter the geographic distribution of invasive alien species (IAS) (Hellmann, Bierwagen, Dukes, &amp; Byers, 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Because IAS species are typically generalists with broad climatic tolerances, they are generally considered likely to cope with climate change which will enable them to expand into new areas (Walther et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34098-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although there is limited evidence for current effects of climate change on IAS distribution, it is often suggested that climate change is one of the main drivers of future invasions (Bellard et al.,
