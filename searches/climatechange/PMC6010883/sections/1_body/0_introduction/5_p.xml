<p class="p">To address this question, we undertook a review of modeling studies that explore how future climate change is predicted to affect some IAS. Specifically, we analyze data on predicted range shifts to examine the change in the potential range size of species due to climate change. We also describe the major biases and caveats of current approaches. We synthesize these studiesâ€™ results focusing on how climate and taxonomic group are associated with the projected change in IAS distribution for these studies. We also look for gaps in existing studies in order to guide future research to improve our understanding of climate change effects on biological invasions.</p>
