<p class="p">Understanding the concept of climate change is critical because many researchers forget to include climate variability and report on climate change as if it is something happening within a short timeframe. Scientists speak about climate change as changes that take place (where) over a long period, and one needs to have records to measure the changes that took place (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). In the absence of records, one has to include climate variability; for example, Afful (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) used the concept of climate variability in his conceptualisation and discussion of the extension competency in climate change. There is a need to differentiate between climate change and variability. According to WIRED UK (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>), climate change is a broad range of global phenomena created predominantly by burning fossil fuels, which add heat-trapping gases to the earthâ€™s atmosphere. These phenomena include the increased temperature trends described by global warming, which also encompass changes such as sea-level rise; ice mass loss in Greenland, Antarctica, the Arctic and mountain glaciers worldwide; shifts in flower/plant blooming; and extreme events. Other authors view the definition from a different perspective; for example, climate change in the IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties, and that persists for an extended period of time, typically decades or longer. It refers to any change in climate over time, whether caused by natural variability or as a result of human activity. This definition provides a comprehensive insight; for example, it was reported that the gradual yet dramatic disappearance of the glaciers on Mount Kilimanjaro is a result of climate change (350Africa.org). The glaciers act as a water tower and several rivers are now drying up. It is estimated that 82% of the ice that capped the mountain, when it was first recorded in 1912, is now gone (350Africa.org).
