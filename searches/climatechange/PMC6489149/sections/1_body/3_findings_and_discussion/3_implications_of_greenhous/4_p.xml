<p class="p">Climate change has significant impact on agriculture, especially on those crops that are dependent on consistent climatic conditions; hence, it affects food security (Vink &amp; Tergurtha 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">n.d.</xref>); it also causes the growing season to be shortened, resulting in disastrous failure (Benhin 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Thus, smallholder farmers who depend on agriculture may experience food shortages. It is important to note that leadership in the two departments of Local Government and the Department of Economic Opportunities responsible for Economic Development and Tourism have acknowledged and agreed that ‘extreme weather events are threatening food security and economic growth’ (Western Cape Department of Agriculture 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>:7). This paper argues that action needs to be taken to mitigate the impact of climate change in the Western Cape Province.
