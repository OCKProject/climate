<p class="p">The paper is based on a literature review. Different search engines were used to search ‘climate change’-related articles in journals and books. Of eight government reports, four were written by consultants on behalf of the government, and 21 articles were found from journals, giving the number of required studies to undertake this research. This means that many articles were consulted and the viewpoints were collected as the basis and parameters for this paper. As indicated, general reports about the Western Cape were used as well as those that reported on challenges of climate change in the Western Cape were included: such as ‘Policy and strategic documents’ Government Policy on Climate Change of (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), the Climate Change Response Strategy in the Western Cape (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), the Western Cape Climate Change Response Framework (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), Green Agri, a Policy Framework for Climate Change for response in the West Coast District (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) and the Farmer’s Weekly of May 2017. All these documents and articles were found useful in terms of expanding the frontiers of knowledge on climate change in the Western Cape. It should be noted that there was no specific study area selected for this article. The methodology was to review the different areas and to point out whether there are policies to deal with the impact of climate change in the Western Cape.
