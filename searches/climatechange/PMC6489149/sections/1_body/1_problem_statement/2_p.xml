<p class="p">The evidence and impacts of climate change in the Western Cape are largely highlighted in the studies by Shabangu (
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>); IPCC (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) and the Government of the Western Cape (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). Agricultural extension services become a must in the drive to increase food production. Such services provide knowledge and advice to primary food producers and facilitate awareness on the changes that occur in the environment and how such changes affect production of food in the Western Cape. This article sought to conceptualise climate change and variability as it affects smallholder farmers in the Western Cape. The impact of climate change on water sources, livestock and crops is highlighted and mitigation strategies are recommended.
