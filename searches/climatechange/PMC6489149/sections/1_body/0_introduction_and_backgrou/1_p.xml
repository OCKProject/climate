<p class="p">Climate change is considered to be one of the biggest challenges that communities are facing locally and internationally (IPCC 2006). The reason why climate change is interpreted as a crisis is that it affects the very sources of human livelihood that are agriculture and the environment. Any disturbance in either agriculture or the environment affects the sources of livelihood of communities. Agriculture plays a major role in food production that feeds nations. The estimated population growth of 1.5 billion in the sub-Saharan countries will expect agriculture to feed them by 2050 (FAO

 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the situation has changed, with extreme heat especially in the subtropics and changes in the rainfall pattern (Serdeczny et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Evidence suggests that the climate change is already affecting the sub-Saharan countries. In a study documented by 350 Africa.org (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">n.d</xref>.), it showed eight ways in which the impact of climate change affects Africa and the sub-Saharan countries. It was confirmed that livestock such as goats and sheep were dying because of a lack of grazing, and water sources were drying up, causing a serious conflict among the users. The impact of climate change also affects South Africa.
