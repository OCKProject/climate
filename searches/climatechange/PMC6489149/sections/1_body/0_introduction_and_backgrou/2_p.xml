These farms are commercially oriented, capital intensive and generally produce a surplus, which account for 90% of the value added and cover 86% of the agricultural land (NDA 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>). The availability of water has become the most limiting factor when it comes to agricultural production in South Africa, especially when one considers rainfall pattern because rainfall is unevenly distributed across the country. According to DWAF (
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>), South Africa receives an annual rainfall of 450 mm, which is low when compared with the worldâ€™s average of 860 mm, and it has high levels of evaporation; on the contrary, South Africa has only 10% of its area that receives more than 750 mm, of which 50% is used for agriculture.
