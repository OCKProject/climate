 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> shows a strong seasonal variability leading researchers to believe that it may be affected by climate change. This is coupled with numerous studies indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> infections are associated with climate variability. The most commonly reported factor is a positive association with temperature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, our understanding of the reasons behind this are limited because unlike other bacteria 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> does not multiple outside the gut. For example the response of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> cases to season and weather patterns has been attributed in the literature to several factors such as the cycling of the organisms in natural reservoirs and the seasonality of countryside visits exposing the public to 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in the environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Other authors have suggested the importance of seasonal and weather associated changes to food consumption (e.g. barbecuing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], elevated consumption of fruit and salad increasing risk of cross-contamination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]). 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> transmission to humans is complex ecologically with multiple hosts and transmission pathways, and currently is poorly understood.
