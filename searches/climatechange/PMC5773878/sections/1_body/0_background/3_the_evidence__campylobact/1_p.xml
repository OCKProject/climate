<p id="Par8" class="p">In developed countries, including the UK, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is the most common bacterial cause of diarrhoeal disease. It can cause abdominal pain and severe diarrhoea. Clinical complications include Guillain-Barre syndrome which requires intensive care in some 20% of cases, and can be fatal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Although poultry consumption is widely implicated as a source of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> many other factors are thought to play a role and many features of the disease are difficult to explain (e.g. spring peak). Consequently the epidemiology of 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is complicated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>] and the transmission pathways for a large proportion of cases are unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. In terms of UK health outcomes following 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> infection a recent study estimates that 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is the major bacterial Infectious Intestinal Disease agent in the UK, leading to over 500,000 cases and 80,000 consultations to general practice annually [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In 2008 the annual cost of acute 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> infection was estimated to be £600 million for England and Wales.Reported 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> disease also appears to be increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. These increases have been occurring in spite of biosecurity initiatives to exclude 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> from poultry flocks.
