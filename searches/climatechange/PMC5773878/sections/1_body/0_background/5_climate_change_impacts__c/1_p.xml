<p id="Par15" class="p">This review has presented evidence that illness with 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> is associated with weather; disease incidence is greater in the summer and during periods of warmer weather incidence is also elevated. Therefore, it would seem logical to assume that climate change would have an impact upon this disease. Although European Infectious Disease experts share a broad agreement that climate change will impact upon 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic>, this is not the case in the UK [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. However, this is at odds with other UK sources which do suggest a moderate impact. This ambiguity may be due to uncertainty over the exact pathways through which weather affects disease incidence. Weather may be associated with 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> but we are unsure as to why. Outside the UK there are projections of changes in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> as a result of climate change. Cullen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>] projects increases in 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> in Ireland of between 2 and 3%. A study in Montreal forecasts that by 2055, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> could increase 23% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. However, given that such studies effectively treat the mechanisms involved as a “black box” it could be argued that these projections are highly uncertain.
