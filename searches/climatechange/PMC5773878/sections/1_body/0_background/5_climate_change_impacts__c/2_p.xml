<p id="Par16" class="p">Schijven et al., examines the use of a decision support tool for determining the links between 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and climate change. Instead of examining associations between weather and 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> they use a Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment approach and split their analysis into a number of pathogen pathways (drinking water, bathing water, oysters and chicken fillet). Within each pathway a number of models are used to estimate climate change impacts. The results indicate that 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> cases associated with poultry consumption are likely to increase under climate change whereas risks associated with the drinking water pathway are likely to decrease due to increased inactivation in higher warmer temperatures.
