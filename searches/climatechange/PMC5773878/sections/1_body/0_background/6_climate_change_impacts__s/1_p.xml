<p id="Par17" class="p">There are strong links between 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> and the environment especially ambient temperature. However, in contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> there is a much clearer biological mechanism explaining why higher temperature leads to an elevated incidence of illness with 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>. At elevated ambient temperatures 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> reproduction is enhanced. However, in spite of this biological mechanism, UK Infectious Disease experts still do not consider 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> to be one of the diseases most likely to be affected by climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. This may be because control measures appear to have substantially reduced levels of the disease since the early 1990â€™s to the point where it is not considered a priority pathogen. There is further evidence that over time the UK is becoming increasingly tolerant to the effects of temperature upon Salmonella infections.However, it is worth considering that around a quarter of Salmonella cases are associated with foreign travel [
