 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> changes. A recent Australian study estimated by 2050 an extra 4000–7000

 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> cases could increase 9.3–16.9% by the 2080’s depending upon the level of mitigation. No specific details are provided for the UK although the study highlights the UK as a country where the largest increase in cases occurs.
