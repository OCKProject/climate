 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], and in this paper we focus upon its potential effects on food. We focus initially upon two food-borne diseases, 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic>. These are chosen because, in addition to their public heath importance, there is much evidence that they are influenced by existing climate variability especially temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Therefore, under a warmer climate, incidence of these infections may change. An understanding of how these two food-borne diseases may be affected by climate change provides important insight into what the impacts may be on other food-borne diseases. The purpose of this review is to consider what the likely impacts of climate change will be, as well as to consider the distributional impacts of any changes. In addition, the review will also consider in less detail other potential impacts which are less well documented in the literature. Due to the broad nature of this topic, this review was not systematic review but built upon 2 previous reviews [
