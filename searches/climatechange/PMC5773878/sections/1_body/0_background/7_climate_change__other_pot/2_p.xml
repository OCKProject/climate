<p id="Par20" class="p">In addition to infectious intestinal disease climate change may have other impacts on food. For example within agriculture one impact may be changes to the seasonal patterns and abundances of pest species and plant diseases both in the UK and globally. Boxall et al., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] highlight that these changes will lead farmers to alter their use of herbicides, pesticides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>] and fungicides in response. This may alter the levels of these residues in food. In addition to changing farming practices, climate change may also affect the transport of food contaminants. Changing soil properties may affect the bioavailability of heavy metals [
