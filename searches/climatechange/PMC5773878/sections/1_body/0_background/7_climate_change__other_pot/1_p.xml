<p id="Par19" class="p">Other intestinal infectious diseases vary seasonally or are sensitive to weather. Consequently climate change could affect such diseases. However, currently there is a lack of evidence on which organisms are likely to be affected and what the public health importance of these are. There are also many different mechanisms through which pathogen prevalence changes could occur, such as changing animal husbandry affecting animal to animal transmission, or new weather patterns altering the survival of pathogens in the environment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Therefore, identifying systems and pathogens most likely to be affected is nearly impossible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. It is suggested that pathogens with low infective doses are most likely to be affected by climate change (e.g. enteric viruses,

 <italic class="italic">E. coli</italic> strains and parasitic protozoa). Those with significant environmental persistence (e.g. enteric viruses and parasitic protozoa) are also likely to be most affected alongside pathogens with recognised stress tolerance responses to pH and temperature (e.g. enterohemorrhagic
