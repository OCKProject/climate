 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> is another important disease examined which exhibits positive associations with ambient temperature. In contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">Campylobacter</italic> there is a clear understanding of some of the mechanisms underlying this association. So although climate change may increase disease incidence, because the overall levels of infection with 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> are declining in the UK these changes are likely to be relatively small. Any changes are likely to affect the young and old disproportionally.
