 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>
 </sup>. Because of the large expense and widespread need for adaptation investments, planning models play a critical role in targeting resources. Traditional water infrastructure planning accounts for uncertainty by adding a safety factor to new infrastructure
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </sup>. However, these large projects are typically irreversible, expensive, and last for multiple decades; the same is true across many infrastructure domains
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>
 </sup>. Preparing for climate change by adding extra capacity, therefore, incurs high risk of expensive overbuilding in resource-scare areas. Flexible infrastructure planning has the potential to manage uncertainty at reduced cost by building less infrastructure up front but enabling expansion in the future if needed

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. However, enabling flexibility often requires substantial proactive planning or upfront investment
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. In water resources, it is difficult to know whether recent trends in streamflow are a result of climate change or short-tern variability and therefore whether they are predictive of future trends
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>
 </sup>. It is therefore difficult for planners to know if and when to trigger adaptive actions. Short-term reliability outages can occur if infrastructure cannot be adapted quickly
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. Further, flexibility can ultimately be more expensive by not taking advantage of economies of scale
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>
 </sup>. Appropriate methods are therefore needed to weigh the risks and benefits of static vs. flexible infrastructure approaches in responding to climate change uncertainty.
