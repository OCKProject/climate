<p id="Par4" class="p">Several recent studies provide methods to develop and assess flexible (also called adaptive) infrastructure planning under climate change uncertainty. Robust decision making (RDM) uses iterative scenario development to minimize the regret from both overbuilding unnecessary infrastructure and being unprepared
