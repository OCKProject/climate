<p id="Par9" class="p">We demonstrate this planning framework, illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, with an application for Mombasa, Kenya. Mombasa is the second largest city in Kenya with an estimated population of 1.1 million

 </sup>. While GCMs all project warming in the region, there is disagreement on the direction of precipitation change. This creates substantial uncertainty in future runoff and therefore the reservoir capacity needed to meet yield targets over its lifetime. We apply our framework to develop and assess a flexible infrastructure design. The flexible design enables extra storage capacity to be added if the initial dam becomes insufficient due to warmer, drier climates.
