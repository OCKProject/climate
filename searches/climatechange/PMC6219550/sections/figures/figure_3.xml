  <p class="p">Spatial representation of movement potential for the Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou around the Gaspésie National Park (black outline) for the most extreme climate change and road restoration scenarios. The area shown is similar to the zoomed area presented in the lower right inset of Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. The color scale represents a gradient of movement potential, from high (blue to green) to low (yellow to red), measured relative to a null model. Values are averaged over the two protected area scenarios (PA0 and PA+). The two white ellipses on (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) indicate the regions where differences among scenarios are greatest.
