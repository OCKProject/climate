<p id="Par23" class="p">There was a significant negative effect of climate scenarios on this indicator (F
 <sub class="sub">3,6</sub> = 230.7, p &lt; 0.001), relative to the reference scenario CC0. The mean reduction in the indicator relative to CC0 was 7.2%. Our interpretation is that caribou tended to remain closer to their subpopulation ranges in climate impacted landscapes. The effect size was smallest under the intermediate climate scenario (CCMed). There was also some evidence of an interaction between climate and protected areas (F
 <sub class="sub">3,6</sub> = 5.048, p = 0.04), but the effect sizes were small, with no clear interpretation. The full ANOVA tables for this and the following analyses are presented in the Supplementary Information
