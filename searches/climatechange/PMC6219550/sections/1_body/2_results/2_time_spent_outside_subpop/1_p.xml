<p id="Par24" class="p">There was a significant effect of climate on this indicator (F
 <sub class="sub">3,6</sub> = 93.4, p &lt; 0.001). The coefficients were positive for all levels with a mean increase of 6.2%, relative CC0. As with Dist
 <sub class="sub">Out</sub>, the effect size was smallest under the intermediate climate scenario. Overall, climate scenarios led to range contraction (Dist
 <sub class="sub">Out</sub>), partially compensated by increased intensity of habitat use (Use
 <sub class="sub">Out</sub>). There was also a significant positive effect of road restoration (F
 <sub class="sub">2,6</sub> = 182.5, p &lt; 0.001) and a significant interaction between climate change and road restoration (F
 <sub class="sub">6,6</sub> = 13.6, p = 0.003). Reducing road density increased use intensity of areas outside the subpopulation ranges. The interaction term suggests that this effect is greatest for scenarios Road100 and increases with the level of climate change.
