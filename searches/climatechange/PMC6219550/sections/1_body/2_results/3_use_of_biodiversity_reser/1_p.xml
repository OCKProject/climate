<p id="Par25" class="p">There was a significant effect of climate change on the mean number of visits per cell inside the biodiversity reserves (Use
 <sub class="sub">RB</sub>) (F
 <sub class="sub">3,6</sub> = 28.4, p &lt; 0.001). The effects were negative, and markedly largest under scenario CCHigh. Counter-intuitively, there was also a significant negative effect of protected areas (F
 <sub class="sub">1,6</sub> = 45.0, p &lt; 0.001). There was also a significant positive interaction between the protected areas and the road restoration scenarios (F
 <sub class="sub">2,6</sub> = 32.1, p &lt; 0.001). The impact of protected areas was positive under road restoration, and the effect size was markedly highest under full road restoration. It appears that full restoration of secondary roads within existing protected areas increases the accessibility of the new protected areas.
