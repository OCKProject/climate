<p id="Par26" class="p">There was a significant negative effect of climate change scenarios on the area of high movement potential (Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub>) for caribou (F
 <sub class="sub">3,6</sub> = 556.5, p &lt; 0.001). As the magnitude of climate change effects increased, Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). There was a small decreasing effect of the protected area scenarios on Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> (F
 <sub class="sub">1,6</sub> = 12.1, p = 0.013), suggesting that the addition of the new protected areas reduced Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub>. There was a positive impact of secondary road restoration on Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> (F
 <sub class="sub">2,6</sub> = 1245.2, p &lt; 0.001), the more roads were restored, the larger was Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Only the scenario with a complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas (Road100) was able to fully compensate the impacts of climate change on Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> (horizontal dashed line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).There was a significant interaction between the protected areas and road restoration (F
 <sub class="sub">2,6</sub> = 11.1, p = 0.010).The improvement in movement potential due to the protected areas is enhanced by road restoration as more roads were restored with more protected areas present in the study area.
