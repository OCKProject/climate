<p id="Par27" class="p">In the base scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), areas with high movement potential were mostly located within subpopulation ranges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Some areas outside the Gaspésie National Park were used more frequently than predicted under the null model, mostly areas south and west of the Logan range. Some of these areas were not visited as much under high climate change impacts, and movement was more constrained inside of the park (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). The complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>) increased the area of high movement potential, mostly by reinforcing travel corridor(s) between the Albert and Logan subpopulations by creating a large patch of high movement potential connecting the two summits. Under the most severe climate change scenario, the complete restoration of secondary roads from Gaspésie National Park (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>) was still able to maintain a high movement potential between these two subpopulations inside the park, even though movement potential was still reduced outside of the park. All scenarios identified the same region of very low movement potential associated with the paved roads between the Albert and the McGerrigle ranges (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The McGerrigle subpopulation remained disconnected in all scenarios. Movement potential maps for other scenarios are not shown, as they fell between the four extremes of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>.
