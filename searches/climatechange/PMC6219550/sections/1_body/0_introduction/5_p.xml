<p id="Par6" class="p">We explore the capacity of compensatory conservation to minimize climate change impacts by using a sufficiently mechanistic SE-IBM to predict animal movement potential on landscapes impacted by land use and climate change. We used the endangered Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou, a relict population now confined to high-elevation habitats within a highly modified, managed boreal forest landscape in Québec, Canada. As elsewhere in North America

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>, this caribou population is negatively affected by the presence of roads and a long history of forest management

 </sup>. We used a scenario approach to represent the effects of climate change and conservation actions on the structure of future landscapes. Conservation actions included establishing new protected areas and the restoration into natural habitats of secondary road segments inside protected areas, two measures that are actionable by local authorities and that might be expected to increase movement potential.
