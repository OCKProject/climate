 </sup> are two possible measures that are used frequently to address current conservation problems. They may also compensate for negative changes anticipated under climate change. However, the effectiveness of particular conservation measures in compensating for undesired changes in population characteristics of interest will likely require models of sufficient mechanistic details and sophistication to evaluate non-linear responses outside of historical conditions. Spatially-explicit individual-based models (SE-IBMs) are promising for such purposes. SE-IBMs can link individual behaviors to landscape features that may be affected by climate change, human land use, as well as conservation measures. For example, in the case of habitat alteration caused by roads, many mammal species exhibit complex movement behaviors in response to the presence of these linear features
