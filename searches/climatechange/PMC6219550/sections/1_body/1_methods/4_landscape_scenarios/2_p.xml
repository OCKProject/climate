<p id="Par15" class="p">We defined 24 landscape scenarios representing possible conditions in 2080 under all combinations of the four climate change scenarios and six conservation scenarios described below. We applied different rules to generate the corresponding future states of the land cover and linear structures layers used in the RSF models. More complete definitions of each scenario and of the rules applied to derive the future landscapes from present conditions are presented in Supplementary InformationÂ
