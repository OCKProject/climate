<p id="Par14" class="p">We test the efficacy of new protected areas and of restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas as alternative compensatory measures. The movement model has sufficient mechanistic complexity to respond to these two conservation measures which both create more high quality habitats. They will affect the choice of movement behavior and the movement direction of the simulated caribou. In the model, only paved roads act as strong barriers, represented by specific model parameter for road-crossing probability estimated from movement data. These roads were considered too important to the regional economy to be restored into natural habitat and they are not considered in the conservation measures.</p>
