 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>.We used this revised SE-IBM to simulate and map caribou movement potential on different landscape scenarios, representing future conditions under alternate climate and conservation scenarios. The SE-IBM simulates daily caribou movement using two different habitat-dependent movement behaviors, a random walk in high quality habitats and a foray loop

 </sup> in low quality habitats. Movement direction is habitat-mediated in both movement behaviors with a preference for higher quality habitats, an avoidance of major paved roads and a seasonal attraction to individuals’ mating area
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>. Habitat quality was defined by two seasonal Resource Selection Functions (RSF) previously developed for the Atlantic-Gaspésie caribou
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup>, reflecting the relative probability of occurrence of collared animals (i.e., proxy for the habitat suitability for the population in the study area). RSF models defined habitat conditions using four classes of land cover: alpine tundra, mature fir stands (older than 50 years), regenerating stands (younger than 30 years) and “other”, and three types of linear structures: paved roads, secondary/gravel roads (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>) and hiking trails. A predicted RSF value was used as a threshold to separate high and low quality habitats
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup> to then assign the appropriate movement behavior. High quality habitats were mostly alpine tundra on mountain tops or mature fir stands, both usually far from roads and trails. Low quality habitats were mostly regenerating stands and linear features, mainly secondary roads
