<p id="Par11" class="p">The Gaspésie peninsula belongs to the boreal biome. Most of its area, except along the coasts, belongs to the balsam fir – white birch bioclimatic domain
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. The forests are dominated by balsam fir and white spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea glauca</italic>) stands mixed with white birch (
 <italic class="italic">Betula papyrifera</italic>) on mesic sites. On less favorable sites, black spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea mariana</italic>), jack pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus banksiana</italic>) and larch (
 <italic class="italic">Larix spp</italic>) are found alongside white birch or trembling aspen (
 <italic class="italic">Populus tremuloides</italic>). The main natural disturbances in this region are spruce budworm (
 <italic class="italic">Choristoneura fumiferana</italic>) outbreaks

 </sup> and windthrow (source: ecoforestry maps, Ministère des Forêts, de la Faune et des Parcs du Québec, MFFP). Precipitation is abundant due to the maritime climate and therefore wildfires are infrequent

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>
 </sup>. Most of the forests are publicly owned and managed by MFFP. An extensive network of secondary roads (56,775 km inside the study area so a road density of 2.3 km/km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), mostly gravel surfaced, has been constructed to support forest harvesting (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Some of these secondary roads are present inside protected areas (806 km) with a few in the Gaspésie National Park (376 km), mostly between the Logan and Albert summits (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). A sparser network of primary paved roads (8,116 km) serves the interior of the peninsula with two nearly parallel segments bisecting the Gaspésie National Park and others circling around the park, completely isolating the eastern-most McGerrigle subpopulation from the outside of the park and from the other two subpopulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>).
