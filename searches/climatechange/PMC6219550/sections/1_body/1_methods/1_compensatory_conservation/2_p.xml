<p id="Par8" class="p">Following the framework, we select: (1) an endangered boreal caribou population whose habitat is threatened by climate and (2) distance and time spent outside of home ranges, use of proposed new protected areas and movement potential as population characteristics that interacts with landscapes and would therefore show a response to both climate and habitat restoration. (3) This population has at least two landscape-scale conservation measures that could have positive impacts: creation of new protected areas and road restoration; (4) there is an SE-IBM available with sufficient sophistication to respond to changes in climate and to alternative conservation measures, and (5) there is ample potential in both conservation measures to examine conservation intensity. We elaborate below.</p>
