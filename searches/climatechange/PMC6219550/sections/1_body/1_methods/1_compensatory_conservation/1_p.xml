<p id="Par7" class="p">We propose a simple framework to address compensatory conservation questions. First, the conservation problem must have a “difficult-to-alter” cause, such as global climate change. Second, we must identify one or more population characteristics that are likely to be affected by climate change. Third, there must be feasible alternative conservation measures that can counteract the effects of climate change on the identified population characteristics. Fourth, we must have models of sufficient mechanistic sophistication to assess population responses to both climate change and the alternative conservation measures tested. Finally, using the models, we evaluate the consequences of varying levels of implementation of the alternative conservation measures to determine their effectiveness and what level, if any, may suffice to compensate for negative impacts of climate change.</p>
