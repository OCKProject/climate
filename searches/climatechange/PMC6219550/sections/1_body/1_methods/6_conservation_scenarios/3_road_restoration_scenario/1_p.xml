<p id="Par19" class="p">We tested the potential of land restoration to reduce the negative effects of roads as another potential conservation activity. We represented road restoration scenarios in the model by reducing the density of secondary roads inside protected areas (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). This can change movement behavior by locally improving the habitat quality of presently roaded areas. We defined three road restoration scenarios. No roads were modified in Road0, we reduced road density by 50% in Road50 and by 100% in Road100. Road restoration treatments applied inside all existing protected areas, and also in the biodiversity reserves under the 12 landscape scenarios including PA+.
