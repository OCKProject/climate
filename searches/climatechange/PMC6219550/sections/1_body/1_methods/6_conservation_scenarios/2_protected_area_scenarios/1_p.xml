<p id="Par18" class="p">PA0 represented the current state with the existing protected areas in the landscape (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). In scenario PA+, we added the biodiversity reserves defined by the MDDELCC as new protected areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Within protected areas, forest stands were affected by natural disturbances and climate change when predicting future conditions. Outside protected areas, forestry activities and climate change impacted forest stands. We applied the governmental forest management plan (source: Bureau du forestier en chef) to predict the future forest cover. Current management actions try to limit natural disturbance impacts on forests outside protected areas and, furthermore, forest management planning implicitly includes them
