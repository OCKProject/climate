<p id="Par16" class="p">Four climate scenarios were defined in terms of impacts with different intensities on vegetation succession and on natural disturbances up to 2080. We used predictions from the literature to generate the future states of each habitat type under each scenario. Scenario CC0 represented the current climate. The magnitude of climate effects varied among the other three scenarios from low (CCMin), to medium (CCMed) to high (CCHigh). Overall, climate change impacts reduced the areas of tundra, lost through shrub densification
