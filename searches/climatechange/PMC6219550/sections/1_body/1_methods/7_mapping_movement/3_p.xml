<p id="Par22" class="p">We calculated movement potential maps under a given scenario as the difference between the predicted movement maps of the scenario and the null model, except for cells containing zeros in both maps were undefined. We then rescaled to [âˆ’1; 1] by dividing negative values by the minimum value and positive values by the maximum. Positive values indicate cells into which caribou moved more frequently than under the null model (i.e. cells overused relative to the null model). Negative values indicate underused cells where caribou moved less frequently than under the null model. These maps show areas where caribou have a high or low capability/propensity to move, after correcting for bias due to their initial positions within the subpopulation ranges, and for the effects of distance from these ranges. Overused areas were favored by the caribou due to habitat conditions, road absence or site fidelity; movement to those areas was facilitated and sought by the individuals, and movement potential was therefore high. Underused areas were avoided or unreachable by caribou; movement potential was low. We calculated the area (km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) of high movement potential (Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub>) in each scenario, defined as the area where movement potential was greater than 0.01. The results were insensitive to the threshold level above 0.01 but were highly unstable between 0 and 0.01. The threshold of 0.01 removed the noise around zero at locations where the SE-IBM and null model movement maps were similar. We tested the effect of climate and conservation scenarios on Area
 <sub class="sub">HMP</sub> by a 3 factor ANOVA with main effects and 2-way interactions, as above.
