<p id="Par20" class="p">For each of the 24 landscape scenarios, we built the two seasonal habitat quality layers by applying the RSF models to the scenario’s landscape. We used the updated SE-IBM to run 10,000 independent replicate simulations of caribou movement under each scenario. Simulations were of 4 years duration, included 20 individuals from each subpopulation and were initialized by randomly placing individuals within their respective subpopulation ranges. To incorporate model uncertainty, SE-IBM parameters were sampled from the distributions of the updated parameter estimates (Supplementary Information Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1.1</xref>) for each simulation. We summarized caribou movement by counting the number of caribou visits per landscape cell over the last three years of each simulation. First year locations were not included to limit the effect of initial locations. For each scenario, the per-simulation results were summed over the 10,000 replicates to create predicted movement maps, following Bauduin

 </sup>. Initial tests established that increasing the number of individuals, the duration, or the number of replicates per scenario had minimal effect on the results. We also generated a predicted movement map under a null model, as for a 25

That is, habitat quality did not vary seasonally or by location and there were no roads; all cells had the same quality value of 1. The null movement model was derived from the SE-IBM by disabling mating site fidelity and foray loop behavior. Therefore caribou movements followed a simple random walk, starting from their initial locations. The resulting predicted movement map resembled an observation of the sum of three independent diffusion models
