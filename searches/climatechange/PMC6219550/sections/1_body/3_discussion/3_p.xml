<p id="Par30" class="p">Implementing the Government of Québec’s proposed new protected areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) increased caribou movement potential but was not able to enough compensate for its decline under climate change scenarios. One explanation for this is that most of the proposed new protected areas are located too far from the existing population range to be meaningfully reachable by individual caribou, and so did not increase the area within which they moved. However, these protected areas were visited more frequently when secondary roads were restored. Therefore, a better explanation seems to be that the existing road network inside the proposed protected areas impedes movement sufficiently as to negate their beneficial impact on overall movement potential. Protected areas can be effective tools for species conservation
