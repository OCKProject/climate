<p id="Par32" class="p">Our estimates of the effects of climate change and our vegetation dynamics simulations were relatively simple. This is in part because those are challenging topics, with many potential assumptions with any model that attempts to address them. Thus rather than focusing on the potential impacts of a more sophisticated vegetation dynamics model and climate effect model, we expressed model uncertainty by running multiple scenarios that bracket the range of possible climate and vegetation conditions. This approach is sufficient, provided the scenarios cover a wide range of potential conditions. We used data-driven RSF models to map habitat quality for our IBM. RSF models tend to be less reliable than mechanistic models when extrapolating under novel conditions (see Bauduin

 </sup>). This would limit the applicability of our RSF model if the landscape of Gasp√©sie were to change markedly under climate change, for example if one habitat type were to disappear, or a new one were to emerge. However, no such drastic changes were simulated. Therefore, we feel that having a more mechanistic model to predict habitat quality would not much affect our key findings regarding the effects of compensatory conservation in this particular circumstance, or, more generally, our proposed framework for evaluating such effects.
