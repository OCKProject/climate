<p id="Par28" class="p">Following the framework we presented, we first identified population characteristics that are likely affected by a high inertia process, here climate change; we then coupled efforts at quantifying climate change impacts on this characteristic with efforts at identifying and quantifying the effects of alternative conservation measures. We chose caribou movement characteristics to inform on the population response to climate change mediated through changes in the landscape. Movement decisions are known to influence individual survival and fitness in caribou

 </sup>. Other characteristics, such as reproductive success rate, mortality or population structure could be used, as long as they are affected by the identified threat and impact population persistence. The projected effects of climate change on our landscape significantly reduced the use of the landscape far from the caribou ranges and decreased their movement potential. The Atlantic-Gasp√©sie caribou lives in a mountainous area

 </sup>). Caribou used the reduced area of suitable environment more uniformly. This modification in movement was caused by a change in vegetation cover which reduced the abundance of high quality habitat, outside of the park but also inside, in the heart of their ranges. Climate change is a global threat to biodiversity
