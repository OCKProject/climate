<p id="Par33" class="p">We designed a simple framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different conservation actions faced with a diversity of stressors on an ecological system. We present results showing that addressing lower inertia stressors can compensate for the declines caused by higher inertia stressors. To do this, we linked movement behavior to the spatial distribution of habitat elements and estimated the relative effectiveness of alternate compensatory conservation actions in terms of their ability to offset losses of movement due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. By linking landscape structure to movement behavior, this approach has the potential to more directly link habitat change to population consequences. This would help managers to identify conservation actions likely to prove effective in sustaining populations in disturbed landscapes and in compensating for further climate and land-use change. Climate change effects may be hard to stop or reverse, but compensatory conservation actions acting on key elements of the landscapes could help species cope with some negative impacts of climate change.</p>
