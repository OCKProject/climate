Some of the expected changes result from processes whose effects will be difficult to alter, such as global climate change. We present a novel framework in which we use models to (1) identify the ecological changes from these difficult-to-alter processes, as well as (2) the potential conservation measures that are best able to compensate for these changes. We illustrated this framework with the case of an endangered caribou population in Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada. We coupled a spatially explicit individual-based movement model with a range of landscape scenarios to assess the impacts of varying degrees of climate change, and the ability of conservation actions to compensate for such impacts on caribou movement behaviors. We found that (1) climate change impacts reduced movement potential, and that (2) the complete restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was able to fully offset this reduction, suggesting that road restoration would be an effective compensatory conservation action. By evaluating conservation actions via landscape use simulated by an individual-based model, we were able to identify compensatory conservation options for an endangered species facing climate change.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Both mitigation and compensatory measures have been applied to biological conservation in the face of exogenous processes such as climate or land use change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Mitigation measures seek to avoid or minimize the direct, negative impacts of such processes. Compensatory measures target potential changes, with the goal of offsetting their impacts<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. However, the direct negative impacts of some processes may be too severe to mitigate<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Climate change mitigation, for example, is hard because the changes now underway have high inertia with trajectories that are difficult and slow to alter<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Compensatory measures would seek to help affected populations deal with climate change consequences such as assisted migration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> or environmental restoration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Compensatory measures may be more effective in this case, and more tractable from the perspective of regional authorities pursuing specific conservation goals. In spite of the critical need for conservation via compensatory measures, we do not have a framework for identifying them and quantifying their efficacy. Here, we explore compensatory conservation measures for climate change impacts on a threatened population of a widely ranging large mammal species: the boreal caribou (<italic>Rangifer tarandus caribou</italic>) population in Gasp&#x000e9;sie, Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada.</p><p id="Par3">Incorporating climate change into conservation studies is emerging as a major challenge in designing new protected areas and other conservation measures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. For example, habitat protection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup> and restoration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup> are two possible measures that are used frequently to address current conservation problems. They may also compensate for negative changes anticipated under climate change. However, the effectiveness of particular conservation measures in compensating for undesired changes in population characteristics of interest will likely require models of sufficient mechanistic details and sophistication to evaluate non-linear responses outside of historical conditions. Spatially-explicit individual-based models (SE-IBMs) are promising for such purposes. SE-IBMs can link individual behaviors to landscape features that may be affected by climate change, human land use, as well as conservation measures. For example, in the case of habitat alteration caused by roads, many mammal species exhibit complex movement behaviors in response to the presence of these linear features<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">For large mammals, loss of habitat and anthropogenic linear features are key drivers of many conservation problems. Establishment of protected areas has been shown to be effective in many cases as it prevents further habitat losses or creates a place for habitat recovery<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Similarly, studies have shown that linear features such as secondary roads are heavily used by predators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup> and, at high density, may increase predator-prey encounter rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> and consequently prey mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Thus, land rehabilitation through road removal (hereafter &#x0201c;road restoration&#x0201d;) could further benefit endangered prey species, like caribou, by reducing predation rates, a known factor in our study population&#x02019;s decline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. Their impacts on populations are numerous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, depending on the size of the road: difficulty of crossing due to fences and light<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, increased probability of predator presence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>, and risk of collisions. Secondary roads (e.g., forestry roads) have the potential to be restored, and on primary roads (e.g., highways) over or under-passes can be installed (e.g., Banff National Park<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>). We do not know how effective these two major conservation measures are, or to what degree they are able to compensate for predicted loses due to climate change.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we propose a simple framework illustrated with a case study to assess the effectiveness of compensatory conservation measures. This involves explicit coupling of efforts at quantifying climate change impacts with efforts at identifying and quantifying conservation measures that might have a similar magnitude, but opposite, impacts. By doing this, we explicitly identify conservation measures that can compensate for undesired changes due to future climate. For our case study, we were motivated by the need for species to move to follow their habitat as it changes with climate and land management and to allow or enhance mixing between disjunct populations. We therefore examine different movement behaviors, among which the movement potential, of an endangered population within a landscape. &#x0201c;Movement potential&#x0201d; has been used in two contrasting ways in the recent literature: by Gustine <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> to refer to an estimated area accessible from a location given observed movement rates; and by Hooten <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> as a potential field whose value at a point is the preferred direction of movement, determined by the gradient of environmental conditions. For the purposes of this study, we define &#x0201c;movement potential&#x0201d; as the aggregate of individuals&#x02019; capability and propensity to change their spatial location. Capability depends on individuals&#x02019; physical ability and the spatial configuration of their environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Propensity reflects individuals&#x02019; desire to leave or reach certain places<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. Climate change and anthropogenic activities can affect movement potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> by altering environmental conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> thus changing either individual&#x02019;s capability<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> or propensity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> to move.</p><p id="Par6">We explore the capacity of compensatory conservation to minimize climate change impacts by using a sufficiently mechanistic SE-IBM to predict animal movement potential on landscapes impacted by land use and climate change. We used the endangered Atlantic-Gasp&#x000e9;sie caribou, a relict population now confined to high-elevation habitats within a highly modified, managed boreal forest landscape in Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada. As elsewhere in North America<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, this caribou population is negatively affected by the presence of roads and a long history of forest management<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. We used a scenario approach to represent the effects of climate change and conservation actions on the structure of future landscapes. Conservation actions included establishing new protected areas and the restoration into natural habitats of secondary road segments inside protected areas, two measures that are actionable by local authorities and that might be expected to increase movement potential.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Compensatory conservation framework</title><p id="Par7">We propose a simple framework to address compensatory conservation questions. First, the conservation problem must have a &#x0201c;difficult-to-alter&#x0201d; cause, such as global climate change. Second, we must identify one or more population characteristics that are likely to be affected by climate change. Third, there must be feasible alternative conservation measures that can counteract the effects of climate change on the identified population characteristics. Fourth, we must have models of sufficient mechanistic sophistication to assess population responses to both climate change and the alternative conservation measures tested. Finally, using the models, we evaluate the consequences of varying levels of implementation of the alternative conservation measures to determine their effectiveness and what level, if any, may suffice to compensate for negative impacts of climate change.</p><p id="Par8">Following the framework, we select: (1) an endangered boreal caribou population whose habitat is threatened by climate and (2) distance and time spent outside of home ranges, use of proposed new protected areas and movement potential as population characteristics that interacts with landscapes and would therefore show a response to both climate and habitat restoration. (3) This population has at least two landscape-scale conservation measures that could have positive impacts: creation of new protected areas and road restoration; (4) there is an SE-IBM available with sufficient sophistication to respond to changes in climate and to alternative conservation measures, and (5) there is ample potential in both conservation measures to examine conservation intensity.

Consequently, the population has been listed as endangered since 2000<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> and based on its genetic diversity, movement, behavior and distribution, it was identified as one of the 12 Designatable Units for caribou in Canada (i.e., a significant unit that is an irreplaceable component of Canada&#x02019;s biodiversity)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Populations of coyotes (<italic>Canis latrans</italic>) and bears (<italic>Ursus americanus</italic>) are sustained by a high abundance of their primary prey species (e.g., moose, <italic>Alces americanus</italic>) and of forage promoted by forestry activities. Incidental predation on caribou by these predators seems to be the main cause of recent declines in the caribou population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. The caribou population relies on the alpine tundra as an open space to find mating partners and avoid predators. These caribou primarily feed on alpine herbaceous plants and graminoids.

The SE-IBM simulates daily caribou movement using two different habitat-dependent movement behaviors, a random walk in high quality habitats and a foray loop<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> in low quality habitats. Movement direction is habitat-mediated in both movement behaviors with a preference for higher quality habitats, an avoidance of major paved roads and a seasonal attraction to individuals&#x02019; mating area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Habitat quality was defined by two seasonal Resource Selection Functions (RSF) previously developed for the Atlantic-Gasp&#x000e9;sie caribou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>, reflecting the relative probability of occurrence of collared animals (i.e., proxy for the habitat suitability for the population in the study area). RSF models defined habitat conditions using four classes of land cover: alpine tundra, mature fir stands (older than 50 years), regenerating stands (younger than 30 years) and &#x0201c;other&#x0201d;, and three types of linear structures: paved roads, secondary/gravel roads (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>) and hiking trails. A predicted RSF value was used as a threshold to separate high and low quality habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup> to then assign the appropriate movement behavior. High quality habitats were mostly alpine tundra on mountain tops or mature fir stands, both usually far from roads and trails. Low quality habitats were mostly regenerating stands and linear features, mainly secondary roads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Landscape scenarios</title><p id="Par14">We test the efficacy of new protected areas and of restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas as alternative compensatory measures.

This can change movement behavior by locally improving the habitat quality of presently roaded areas. We defined three road restoration scenarios. No roads were modified in Road0, we reduced road density by 50% in Road50 and by 100% in Road100. Road restoration treatments applied inside all existing protected areas, and also in the biodiversity reserves under the 12 landscape scenarios including PA+.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Mapping movement</title><p id="Par20">For each of the 24 landscape scenarios, we built the two seasonal habitat quality layers by applying the RSF models to the scenario&#x02019;s landscape. We used the updated SE-IBM to run 10,000 independent replicate simulations of caribou movement under each scenario. Simulations were of 4 years duration, included 20 individuals from each subpopulation and were initialized by randomly placing individuals within their respective subpopulation ranges. To incorporate model uncertainty, SE-IBM parameters were sampled from the distributions of the updated parameter estimates (Supplementary Information Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1.1</xref>) for each simulation. We summarized caribou movement by counting the number of caribou visits per landscape cell over the last three years of each simulation. First year locations were not included to limit the effect of initial locations. For each scenario, the per-simulation results were summed over the 10,000 replicates to create predicted movement maps, following Bauduin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. Initial tests established that increasing the number of individuals, the duration, or the number of replicates per scenario had minimal effect on the results. We also generated a predicted movement map under a null model, as for a 25<sup>th</sup> scenario. The null landscape was defined by a single, homogeneous habitat quality layer. That is, habitat quality did not vary seasonally or by location and there were no roads; all cells had the same quality value of 1. The null movement model was derived from the SE-IBM by disabling mating site fidelity and foray loop behavior. Therefore caribou movements followed a simple random walk, starting from their initial locations. The resulting predicted movement map resembled an observation of the sum of three independent diffusion models<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup> centered at the subpopulation range centroids.</p><p id="Par21">We used the predictive movement maps to quantify the impacts of the climate change and conservation scenarios on the simulated caribou movement behavior. We assessed three potential impacts: the distance of movement beyond the present subpopulation ranges; the proportion of time spent outside these ranges; and the use of the biodiversity reserves. We measured the movement distance as the number of cells outside the present subpopulation ranges that were visited at least once (Dist<sub>Out</sub>). We used the mean number of visits in these cells to measure the amount of time spent outside the ranges (Use<sub>Out</sub>). We measured the use of biodiversity reserves as the mean number of visits over all cells within the biodiversity reserves (Use<sub>RB</sub>). We tested for scenario effects on these indicators using 3 factor ANOVAs with main effects and all 2-way interactions, without replication. The values calculated for the scenario predictive movement maps are estimates of the expected value of the simulated indicators, given the scenario specifications. The climate and conservation (protected areas and roads) scenarios are represented as treatment factors of 4, 2 and 3 levels, respectively. Therefore, the model degrees of freedom are 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x02009;+&#x02009;1&#x02009;+&#x02009;2 for the main effects plus 11&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x02009;+&#x02009;6&#x02009;+&#x02009;2 for the 2-way interactions, leaving 6&#x02009;=&#x02009;24&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;1&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;6&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;11 residual degrees of freedom. In a traditional ANOVA with replications, effects are assessed relative to the process variance, and significance levels decrease with the number of replicates, which can be made arbitrarily large. In ANOVA without replication, effects are assessed relative to a residual variance determined by the experimental design, and significance levels depend on the design but not on the number of replicates per se. Rather, increased replications decreases the standard error of the estimated scenario means. For these reasons, we consider ANOVA on the group means to be appropriate for analysis of simulation experiments.</p><p id="Par22">We calculated movement potential maps under a given scenario as the difference between the predicted movement maps of the scenario and the null model, except for cells containing zeros in both maps were undefined. We then rescaled to [&#x02212;1; 1] by dividing negative values by the minimum value and positive values by the maximum. Positive values indicate cells into which caribou moved more frequently than under the null model (i.e. cells overused relative to the null model). Negative values indicate underused cells where caribou moved less frequently than under the null model. These maps show areas where caribou have a high or low capability/propensity to move, after correcting for bias due to their initial positions within the subpopulation ranges, and for the effects of distance from these ranges. Overused areas were favored by the caribou due to habitat conditions, road absence or site fidelity; movement to those areas was facilitated and sought by the individuals, and movement potential was therefore high. Underused areas were avoided or unreachable by caribou; movement potential was low. We calculated the area (km<sup>2</sup>) of high movement potential (Area<sub>HMP</sub>) in each scenario, defined as the area where movement potential was greater than 0.01. The results were insensitive to the threshold level above 0.01 but were highly unstable between 0 and 0.01. The threshold of 0.01 removed the noise around zero at locations where the SE-IBM and null model movement maps were similar. We tested the effect of climate and conservation scenarios on Area<sub>HMP</sub> by a 3 factor ANOVA with main effects and 2-way interactions, as above.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Distance moved from subpopulation ranges</title><p id="Par23">There was a significant negative effect of climate scenarios on this indicator (F<sub>3,6</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;230.7, p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), relative to the reference scenario CC0.

We chose caribou movement characteristics to inform on the population response to climate change mediated through changes in the landscape. Movement decisions are known to influence individual survival and fitness in caribou<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Other characteristics, such as reproductive success rate, mortality or population structure could be used, as long as they are affected by the identified threat and impact population persistence. The projected effects of climate change on our landscape significantly reduced the use of the landscape far from the caribou ranges and decreased their movement potential. The Atlantic-Gasp&#x000e9;sie caribou lives in a mountainous area<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>, where climate change can drive individuals to higher elevation (see examples in Chen <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>). Caribou used the reduced area of suitable environment more uniformly. This modification in movement was caused by a change in vegetation cover which reduced the abundance of high quality habitat, outside of the park but also inside, in the heart of their ranges. Climate change is a global threat to biodiversity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Finding effective compensatory measures to help species cope with its impact is an urgent for conservation biology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par29">The restoration of secondary roads inside protected areas was the most effective of the two compensatory strategies we considered. Roads are an important target for conservation action. Road networks fragmenting landscapes inhibit movements for many species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup>. Our findings point to the importance of managing secondary road networks for their effects on movement potential, specifically by limiting or reducing the density of such roads. This conservation measure has on-the-ground momentum with a pilot project in Gasp&#x000e9;sie recently started to close and rehabilitate derelict roads<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup>. Our study is the first to show that this effort, if expanded, could offset predicted declines due to climate change. Restoring secondary roads inside protected areas, and in particular inside the Gasp&#x000e9;sie National Park, increased the use of habitat around the subpopulation ranges as a result of a better habitat quality, while keeping the individuals close to their mating areas even in the case of a habitat reduction due to climate change. However, the full restoration of secondary roads was required to fully compensate for movement reductions we predicted under climate change. In this study we simulated road restoration by reducing road density, removing 50% or 100% of the road segments. In practice, what is required is not full road restoration, but rather restoration of functional habitat on roaded areas<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup>. The technical requirements and costs for such restoration in our study area could not be considered here. The SE-IBM we used in this study could be applied in a more detailed study to identify priority sections of roads to restore or locate crossing structures<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> to be most effective and to predict their effect on movement characteristics and subpopulation connectivity. This potential model application would be supported by the clear presence of travel corridors (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a,b</xref>).</p><p id="Par30">Implementing the Government of Qu&#x000e9;bec&#x02019;s proposed new protected areas (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>) increased caribou movement potential but was not able to enough compensate for its decline under climate change scenarios. One explanation for this is that most of the proposed new protected areas are located too far from the existing population range to be meaningfully reachable by individual caribou, and so did not increase the area within which they moved. However, these protected areas were visited more frequently when secondary roads were restored. Therefore, a better explanation seems to be that the existing road network inside the proposed protected areas impedes movement sufficiently as to negate their beneficial impact on overall movement potential. Protected areas can be effective tools for species conservation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup>. However, the design of protected areas networks must be adapted to the emerging threat of climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>. Our findings show how this could be accomplished for the particular case of caribou in Gasp&#x000e9;sie, and support our proposed framework to address the problem in general.</p><p id="Par31">We found that secondary road restoration inside protected areas greatly improved the movement potential between subpopulations.

This is in part because those are challenging topics, with many potential assumptions with any model that attempts to address them. Thus rather than focusing on the potential impacts of a more sophisticated vegetation dynamics model and climate effect model, we expressed model uncertainty by running multiple scenarios that bracket the range of possible climate and vegetation conditions. This approach is sufficient, provided the scenarios cover a wide range of potential conditions. We used data-driven RSF models to map habitat quality for our IBM. RSF models tend to be less reliable than mechanistic models when extrapolating under novel conditions (see Bauduin <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). This would limit the applicability of our RSF model if the landscape of Gasp&#x000e9;sie were to change markedly under climate change, for example if one habitat type were to disappear, or a new one were to emerge. However, no such drastic changes were simulated. Therefore, we feel that having a more mechanistic model to predict habitat quality would not much affect our key findings regarding the effects of compensatory conservation in this particular circumstance, or, more generally, our proposed framework for evaluating such effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par33">We designed a simple framework for evaluating the effectiveness of different conservation actions faced with a diversity of stressors on an ecological system. We present results showing that addressing lower inertia stressors can compensate for the declines caused by higher inertia stressors. To do this, we linked movement behavior to the spatial distribution of habitat elements and estimated the relative effectiveness of alternate compensatory conservation actions in terms of their ability to offset losses of movement due to anthropogenic disturbances and climate change. By linking landscape structure to movement behavior, this approach has the potential to more directly link habitat change to population consequences. This would help managers to identify conservation actions likely to prove effective in sustaining populations in disturbed landscapes and in compensating for further climate and land-use change. Climate change effects may be hard to stop or reverse, but compensatory conservation actions acting on key elements of the landscapes could help species cope with some negative impacts of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
