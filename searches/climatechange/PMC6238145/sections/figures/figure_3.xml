  <p class="p">The effect of the increase in temperature humidity index (THI) from 75.3 to 82.8 under field conditions in Vechur, Kasargode, and crossbred cattle on hematological, serum cortisol, and gene expression. We propose the change in MCV as one of the mechanisms of dwarfing in Vechur and Kasargode cattle. Increased hemoglobin concentration in dwarf cattle shows their high tolerance. White blood cell count, cortisol, and relative expression (RE) of HSP70 gene showed a similar pattern in crossbred cattle. The RE of ATP1A1, GAPDH, and ACTB genes showed similar trends in both dwarf and standard size breeds</p>
