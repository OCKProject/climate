  <p class="p">Changes in vital physiological parameters in response to heat stress (a) Correlation plot showing changes in rectal temperature ‐°C (RT), respiratory rate‐breaths/minute (RR), and pulse rate‐beats/minute (PR) in response to increase in temperature humidity index (THI) from 75.3 to 82.8 under field conditions in Vechur (blue), Kasargode (green), and crossbred (red) cattle. (b) Principal component analysis biplot showing the relationship of RT, RR, and PR with THI. Endotherms maintain constant RT by altering the physiological parameters—RR and PR. Here, heat‐sensitive crossbred cattle shows heterothermy. Vechur and Kasargode cattle employ differential thermoregulatory strategies as Vechur relied more on PR, while Kasargode relied on RR. Molecular phylogeny of different genetic groups using mitochondrial genome sequencing explains evolutionary sequel of this phenomenon</p>
