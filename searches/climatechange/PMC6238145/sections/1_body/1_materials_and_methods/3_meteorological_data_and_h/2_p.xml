<p class="p">Temperature humidity index (THI, expressed as arbitrary unit) denotes the combined effect of ambient temperature and humidity, and is used to monitor heat stress impact in cattle. However, the THI does not comprise key climatic variables such as wind velocity and intensity of solar radiation. Similarly, THI does not account management factors (e.g., access to shade) or animal factors (genotype differences). Heat load index (HLI, expressed as arbitrary unit) is a measure of body heat gain and a correlated index, and the accumulated heat load (AHL, expressed as arbitrary unit) takes into account the duration of exposure to heat. The Accumulated Heat Load Index (AHLI, expressed as arbitrary unit) is the cumulative AHL over a given period in a day (Gaughan, Mader, Holt, &amp; Lisle,
