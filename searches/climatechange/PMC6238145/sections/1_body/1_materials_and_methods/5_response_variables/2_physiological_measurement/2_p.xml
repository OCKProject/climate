<p class="p">We measured physiological variables at half‐hour intervals starting from 08:00 to 14:00. We recorded rectal temperature (RT, °C.) with a digital clinical thermometer. We counted flank movements for 1 min with the help of a stopwatch and recorded respiration rate (RR, breaths/min). The heat tolerance coefficient (HTC, expressed as arbitrary unit) was derived from physiological measurements, HTC = RR/23 + RT/38.3 (Bianca, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1963</xref>). Pulse rate (PR, beats/min) was recorded for 1 min using a stethoscope. Starting from 08:00, 5 ml of blood was collected at 2‐hr intervals via the jugular venous puncture in the vacutainer with 5 mg EDTA as the anticoagulant, under aseptic conditions for hematological and genetic analysis. Blood samples (5 ml) without EDTA were also collected, centrifuged at 450 ×
