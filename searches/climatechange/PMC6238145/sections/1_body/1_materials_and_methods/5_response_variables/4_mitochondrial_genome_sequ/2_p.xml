<p class="p">We sequenced a set of four mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)—three dwarf cattle; Vechur, Kasargode, and Wayanad, and one crossbred cattle by using long‐range PCR. We amplified the entire mtDNA genome with a set of two overlapping PCR fragments. Sequencing was done by next‐generation sequencing with Illumina HiSeq. (Primers‐F15'TTAACCCAAAGCAAGGCACT3, R15'TGAGGATTGTTAGGGCTGCT 3', F25'CCAAGCCTATGTATTCACTCTCC3', R2 5'GGGGCCTGCGT TTA TATA TT G3'). The amplicons were fragmented, end repaired, adenylated, adapter‐ligated, and then amplified by PCR. The amplified DNA library was run on the tape station for size distribution, and the concentration was measured using Qubit. The DNA library thus prepared was sequenced on the HiSeq that generated 2 × 250 bp paired‐end reads. Quality testing like base quality score distribution, sequence quality score distribution, and GC distribution were done, and quality sequences were retained for further analysis. Illumina adapters were trimmed from paired‐end reads using CutAdapt (Martin,

 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The assembled mitochondrial genomes were annotated using MITOS (Bernt et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and the diagrammatic representation of the mitochondrial genomes was created using CGView (Stothard &amp; Wishart,
