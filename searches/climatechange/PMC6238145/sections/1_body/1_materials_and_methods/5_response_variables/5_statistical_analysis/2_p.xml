<p class="p">We conducted statistical tests in R version 3.5.1 (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). We tested the impact of heat stress on different breeds (physiological, hematological, serum cortisol, and relative expression of candidate genes) using separate linear mixed‐effect models. For model fitting, we used the “lme4” package. The correlation plots and principal component analyses were done using “ggplot2, devtools, and ggbiplot” packages. We tested the influence of body size and temperature humidity index (THI) on acute heat stress response of cattle with repeated‐measures ANOVA using linear mixed‐effect models and report the final accepted model. Animals were taken as the random effect. ANOVA (model) in “car” package was used. The random effects in the model were checked using “gls” function in “nlme” package. We selected 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value and pseudo‐
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>‐squared for the model using the “nagelkerke” function in “rcompanion” package. Post hoc analysis was done using Tukey adjusted comparisons in “lsmeans and multcompview” packages. Interaction plots were made using “groupwiseMean” function in “rcompanion and ggplot 2” packages. We estimated the natural means of each breed with THI grouping. We calculated confidence interval of each means with the percentile method and checked for homoscedasticity and independence by plotting residuals versus fitted values.
