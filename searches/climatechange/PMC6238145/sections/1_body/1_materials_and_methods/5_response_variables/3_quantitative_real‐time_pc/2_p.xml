<p class="p">We isolated total l RNA immediately after collecting blood using GeneiPure RNA extraction kit (Cat. No. KT‐173, Genei, Bangalore) following the manufacturer's recommendations. All solutions and buffers were prepared in RNase‐free glassware and 0.1% DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate)‐treated water. Before beginning the experiment, consumables, equipment, and work surfaces were made RNase‐free by using RNaseZAP
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> solution (Cat. No. R2020, Sigma‐Aldrich). To make blood samples RNase‐free, RNAlater
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (Cat. No. R0901, Sigma‐Aldrich) was used. DNase treatment was conducted using DNase1 kit (Cat. No. AMP‐D1, Sigma‐Aldrich). The RNA was quantified using a spectrophotometer (NanoDrop ND‐1000, Thermo Scientific, USA). We checked the RNA quality using agarose gel electrophoresis (0.8%). The relative quantification of gene expression was carried out using Illumina Eco® Q‐RT‐PCR system using SYBR green chemistry, giving the difference in expression (ΔCt) of target genes HSP70 (heat shock protein 70), ATP1A1 (sodium potassium ATPase), and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase) versus reference gene ACTB (Sambrook, Fritsch, &amp; Maniatis, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). The GAPDH was used as reference gene for ACTB. After exposure to heat stress, the fold changes (relative quantification—RQ) in the expression of the above four genes were assessed by comparing between genetic groups using RQ = 2
 <sup class="sup">–∆∆Ct</sup>. The oligonucleotide primers for HSP70, ATP1A1, ACTB, and GAPDH genes were designed using IDT primer design software (

 <xref rid="ece34550-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). The cDNA was synthesized from a constant amount (1 µg) of total RNA using cDNA synthesis kit (Cat. No. K1621, Fermentas) as per the manufacturer's instruction. For Q‐RT‐PCR, Maxima SYBR Green Q‐PCR Master Mix with ROX was used (Cat. No. K0221, Thermo Scientific) and was carried out in 96‐well plates in a thermal cycler (Bio‐Rad, Thermal cycler, USA) as per manufacturer's instructions. Separate PCR reactions were set up for HSP70, ATP1A1, ACTB, and GAPDH genes. We amplified each sample in triplicate (technical replicates) in a reaction volume of 12.5 µl, which contained 1 µl of cDNA+1 µl each of forward and reverse primers (10 pm/µl) + 6.25 µl Maxima SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (2X) + 3.25 µl nuclease‐free water. We followed two‐step Q‐RT‐PCR protocol. The segment 1comprised of enzyme activation (single cycle, 95°C for 10 min). Segment 2 included denaturation and annealing/extension (35 cycles, 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 60 s, respectively). These were followed by a melting step by gentle heating from 62°C to 75°C and finally a cooling down at 4°C. We performed data acquisition during the annealing step. In addition, one nontemplate control (NTC) for each gene and reverse transcription minus (RT minus) control for each sample and a negative control (with only nuclease‐free water) were also included.
