<p class="p">Kerala (10.8505°N, 76.2711°E), located in SW India, has hot and humid summer season from January to May and a warm and humid monsoon season from June to December. The average temperature humidity index (THI, see below) ranges from 72 to 83 throughout the year. Although the maximum temperature rarely rises above 35°C, relative humidity is high resulting in high THI, which can cause high heat stress in cattle. Dwarf cattle breeds (DCB) and standard size cattle breeds (SCB) are ideal for comparative studies because they represent closely related intraspecific incipient breeds, with vastly different size, which have radiated to fill different geographical niches (see Supporting information Figure
