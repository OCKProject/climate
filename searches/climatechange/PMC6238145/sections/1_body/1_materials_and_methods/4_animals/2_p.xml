<p class="p">The Vechur and Kasargode cattle were derived from local populations in the Vechur and Kasargode areas of Kerala and conserved ex situ at the Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University farm. Ten adult lactating nonpregnant animals each of Vechur, Kasargode, and SCB (30 in total) were selected from the wider population at the university farm. The selected animals grazed native pasture during the day and were housed at night. They were trained in the sampling procedures in a presampling exposure period, which reduced handling stress during the sampling period. The animals were free of any infectious diseases and were all in good health. Over a period of 10Â days in the summer, we observed the animals, grazing from 08.00 to 14.00 under THI ranging from 75 to 83. After morning milking, grass ration (Napier grass; 
 <italic class="italic">Pennisetum purpureum</italic>, harvested the same day) and drinking water were given. Baseline physiological measurements were made, and a blood sample collected in the shed before cattle was taken to the pasture at 08:00, where they grazed with no shade until 14.00. Drinking water was provided ad libitum. The Institutional Animal Ethics Committee of Kerala Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Kerala, India, had approved the experimental protocol.
