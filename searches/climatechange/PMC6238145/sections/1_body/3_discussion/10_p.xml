<p class="p">Our findings on body size and stress response variation based on evolutionary and physiological responses are likely to have wider applications for other wild and domestic species and offer insights into stress assessments to predict biological responses to global climate change (Collier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Maloney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). In addition, changes in functional traits like body size have significant repercussions for the thermal biology and energetics of ruminants, as body size directly affects energy requisite for maintenance, growth, and production (Mitchell et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). We argue that variations in the body size of domestic cattle will, therefore, influence resilience to environmental change (Martin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Hence, a genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic approach is needed to understand the underlying phenomena of body size‚Äêrelated adaptability and acclimatization in diverse populations. Further studies using our combined physiological and molecular approach may elucidate further mechanistic differences between stress responses in other breeds and species that may assist to prioritize targeted interventions both to increase species resilience and their adaptive capability (Savolainen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Seebacher et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). To conclude, we must, therefore, select and breed carefully for sustainable livestock production and preserve the domestic genetic resource diversity we already have, as they may hold the solutions to adapt to climate change.
