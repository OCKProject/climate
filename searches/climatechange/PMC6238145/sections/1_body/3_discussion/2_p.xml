<p class="p">Our data support our hypothesis that warm climate has caused a decline in the body size of domestic cattle 
 <italic class="italic">Bos</italic> spp., as DCB is tolerant and adapted. However, SCB has acclimatized to heat through physiological plasticity, reflecting the parallel evolution of adaptive thermal tolerance and body size. Specifically, the adaptation in dwarf cows has been mediated through evolutionary changes as evidenced by molecular phylogenetic analysis using the mitochondrial genome, while acclimatization in crossbred cows has been achieved through alterations in physiological, hormonal, and gene expression profiles. We also observed that genetic changes in the mitochondrial genome are associated with cellular and body size and hemoglobin concentration in phenotypically disparate cattle breeds that are evolved in different geographical niches. These findings illustrate that reduction in body size increases heat tolerance. Our study delineates the adaptive and plastic phenotypic and genotypic changes, both in body size and in thermal tolerance in domestic cattle shaped by parallel evolution and acclimatization, and improves our understanding of species responses to climate warming.
