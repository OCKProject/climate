<p class="p">One notable feature observed in the study was the difference in vital physiological and hematological parameters between Vechur and Kasargode during heat stress. In Vechur, the slope of the relationship between rectal temperature and pulse rate was greater than for Kasargode, which had a stronger relationship between rectal temperature and respiratory rate. Specifically, Vechur relied more on pulse rate, while Kasargode relied on the respiratory rate to maintain body temperature. This differential degree of dependence was also evident in other response variables. The differential strategy used by these two DCB lineages indicates that heat tolerance is not only associated with morphological characteristics like body size. This observation is also intriguing because it reveals that the two breeds from similar environments and with apparent phenotypic similarities employ different physiological pathways and thermoregulatory strategies. A previous study reported a predominance of sweating in some cattle breeds, while others were more prone to thermal polypnea during heat stress (Pereiraet al.,

Overall, Vechur was the most tolerant to heat stress, followed by Kasargode and SCB the least tolerant, and phylogenetic analysis revealed an independent parallel selection for this in the two DCB lineages. Therefore, by combining functional and evolutionary studies, we can conclude that both DCB lineages provide different sources of adaptive potential for resilience to climate change in livestock (Savolainen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The different phylogenetic origins and physiological tolerance mechanisms of co‐occurring, phenotypically similar populations highlight the importance of preserving domestic genetic diversity, including multiple local breeds with superficially similar adaptations, to maintain adaptive potential and future‐proof our domestic gene pools against environmental change (Hoffmann et al.,
