<p class="p">The key strength of our work is the simultaneous evaluation of physiological, hormonal, and molecular changes along with molecular phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial genomes of the different genetic groups studied. This could be supplemented with a broader study across morphologically disparate populations of livestock to assess how environment has influenced trait variations across different temporal and spatial scales. We also emphasize the importance of local responses to small‚Äêscale environmental changes as a contributor to trait variations.</p>
