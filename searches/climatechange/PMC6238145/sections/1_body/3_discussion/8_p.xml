<p class="p">The current challenge is to understand adaptive capacity in different populations, using correlative, mechanistic, and trait‐based vulnerability assessments, particularly for those approaching physiological limits (Mazel, Mooers, Riva, &amp; Pennell, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). For the first time, heat‐tolerant DCB are characterized at physiological, molecular, and phylogenetic levels. Previous studies have shown that heat stress responses encompass a complex network of pathways, even at the cellular level (Collier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Rabouille &amp; Alberti, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Savolainen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We describe heat stress response quantitatively, differentiating adaptive and plastic changes in response to temperature increase, and revealing different thermoregulatory strategies in different breeds of dwarf cattle. The results illustrate different physiological factors contributing to thermal limits of a species in a dose‐dependent manner (Gutierrez‐Alonso et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and their capacity to cope with varying microclimates (Maloney et al.,
