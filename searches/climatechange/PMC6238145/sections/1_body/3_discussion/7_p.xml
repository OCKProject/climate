<p class="p">The phylogeny revealed that Vechur and Wayanad clustered in the Indicus 1 haplotype (I1), while Kasargode clustered in the Indicus 2 (I2) haplotype, showing a convergent evolution of dwarf size in response to high heat and humidity in cattle breeds in different regions (Taye et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The mitochondrial genome of dwarf cattle might have evolved through selection under heat stress (Lajbner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In domestic cattle, dwarfing and tolerance is evolutionarily defined by functional traits developed through maternal founder effect and adaptation to warm environments (Lenstra et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Moreover, dwarf cattle breeds—Vechur, Punganur and Malanad Gidda—follow a continuous distribution in the southern part of the Indian subcontinent. Specifically, zebu cattle (

 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In summary, in the absence of gene flow, the isolated dwarf cattle populations might have adapted independently to their environment (Rozzi, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) through dose‐dependent selection (Gutierrez‐Alonso et al.,
