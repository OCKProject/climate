<p class="p">Furthermore, body temperature variation is associated with reduced fitness, with more extreme daily fluctuations correlated with reduced reproduction in wild mammal populations (Maloney, Marsh, McLeod, &amp; Fuller, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Cells recognize environmental fluctuations through sophisticated signaling pathways and hence stress directly affects the cellular integrity, function, and morphology (Rabouille &amp; Alberti, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and shapes mitochondrial genome evolution (Lajbner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). The maintenance of homeothermy during heat stress in SCB was achieved primarily by heterothermy. In SCB, this narrow physiological tolerance can result in an accumulated metabolic cost of plasticity and subsequent low fitness (Maloney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). For instance, as high hemoglobin concentration is associated with a high metabolic rate at higher temperatures, driven by high oxygen demand (Portner &amp; Knust, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), the low hemoglobin level in SCB reflects low protection against oxidative damage, making them more vulnerable to stress (Collier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Likewise, a significantly higher respiratory rate in SCB than DCB throughout the period of the study suggests total body deficit of bicarbonate (HCO
