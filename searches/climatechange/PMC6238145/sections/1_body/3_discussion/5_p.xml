<p class="p">Also, one of the mechanisms of enhanced tolerance is increased hemoglobin concentration (Brans et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Here, in DCB, hemoglobin concentration increased as body size reduced. In SCB, other hematological values including red blood cell count, white blood cell count, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio, and packed cell volume were also found to be valid indicators of individual stress load. Further, two mechanisms for size reduction are reduced cell size and reduced cell number (Hessen, Daufresne, &amp; Leinaas, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We found that RBC is significantly smaller in DCB as evidenced by reduced MCV. Thus, breeds of different sizes may have evolved in different niches which may, in turn, have determined their thermoregulatory patterns (Pereira et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). We illustrate that, continued genetic changes selected under heat stress would have resulted in reduced cell volume and subsequent body size reduction in DCB (Gutierrez‐Alonso, Hawkins, Cools, Shaw, &amp; Fraaije, 
 <xref rid="ece34550-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Rabouille &amp; Alberti,
