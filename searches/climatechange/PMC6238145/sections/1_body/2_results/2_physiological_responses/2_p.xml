<p class="p">We calculated mean temperature humidity index (THI) for different periods of the day: prestress (08:00–10:00, THI = 75.3–79.2) and heat stress (10.00–14:00, THI = 80.5–82.8, Supporting information Figure

Accumulated heat load (AHL, a measure of heat load) was evident in SCB but not in DCB. Under increasing AHL, SCB showed clinical signs of thermal strain such as open‐mouthed breathing, salivating, reluctance to rise, enhanced licking of the skin, and overall dullness. SCB had a low rectal temperature (RT) relative to DCB at the beginning of the study, but this increased upon heat exposure (Figure

 <sub class="sub">diff</sub> (difference in rectal temperature before and after heat exposure) of 5.4°C, while that for Vechur and Kasargode, cattle was 2.9°C and 3.1°C, respectively. Trends for RT and respiratory rate (RR) were similar in Vechur and Kasargode but trends for pulse rate differed between them (Figure
