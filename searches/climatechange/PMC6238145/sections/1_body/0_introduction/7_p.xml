<p class="p">In the present study, we assessed the acute heat tolerance in DCB (Vechur and Kasargode) and SCB (crossbreds) in a tropical field environment by measuring changes in both phenotypic and genotypic traits. Using a combined physiological and phylogenic approach, we explain how and why body size declined in domestic cattle and how this enhanced heat tolerance. Our aims were to understand the physiological basis and demonstrate the evolutionary origins of differential heat adaptation and/or acclimatization in morphologically distinct domestic cattle. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of acute heat stress, and rates of climatic‚Äêniche evolution of functional traits, in a morphologically distinct population of domestic cattle. Next, we determined whether the variation in traits changed systematically across genetic groups representing different molecular mitochondrial phylogenetic scales by mapping evolutionary processes on to the trait diversity (Lajbner et al.,
