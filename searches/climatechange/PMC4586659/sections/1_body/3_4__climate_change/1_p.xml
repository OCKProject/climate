 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Many infectious disease agents such as viruses and bacteria, and vectors such as mosquitoes are influenced by seasonality and changes in temperature, rainfall and humidity [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. It is widely understood that the process of rapid development and excessive human activities have caused an increase of 0.85 ± 0.2 °C in global mean temperature during the period from 1880 to 2012 [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report) has predicted an increase of 1.1–6.4 °C in the average global land and ocean surface temperature from 1990 to 2100 and highlighted the significant impact of the rising temperature on infectious disease transmission and human health [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Studies have found that the average surface temperature in China has risen by 1.3 °C over the past 58 years (1951–2008) [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. There have also been increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as droughts, landslides, mudslides, and regional and mountain floods [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. These changes in climate will likely favor the transmission of many climate-sensitive diseases, such as mosquito-borne and rodent-borne diseases by affecting the ecology of the diseases, impacting upon their distribution and the number of disease cases.
