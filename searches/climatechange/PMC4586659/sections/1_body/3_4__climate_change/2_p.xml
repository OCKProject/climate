<p class="p">Studies in China have indicated an association between climatic factors and the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, and diseases with rodent reservoirs such as HFRS [

 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Malaria and dengue are mosquito-borne infectious diseases caused by parasites of the genus

 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall have been shown to be associated with the incidence of malaria and dengue via a changing impact on the lifecycles of mosquitoes and parasites, and virus replication [
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Higher temperature can shorten the duration of parasite and virus replication, enhance the reproduction rate of mosquitoes, and increase the frequency of blood feeding and contacts with humans, causing higher incidence of malaria and dengue. However, extremely high temperature may also disrupt mosquito breeding, kill the eggs and larvae, evaporate water in breeding sites and shorten the mosquito survival cycle, leading to a decline in disease incidence [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Likewise, rainfall influences the incidence of malaria and dengue. Increased rainfall favors mosquito development by providing aquatic breeding sites, subsequently increasing mosquito populations and the potential incidence of malaria and dengue [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-12-11025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Although excessive rainfall and flooding may destroy the existing mosquito breeding sites and restrict disease transmission in the short term, it is likely to create more breeding habitats for mosquitoes and increase disease incidence over time [
