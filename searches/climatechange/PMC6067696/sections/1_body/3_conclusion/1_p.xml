At the same time, actions targeting the cause of climate change (reducing GHG emissions) offer large health benefits, especially in the area of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The challenge is now to bring interventions to scaleâ€”practical action requires an informed health workforce, an engaged public, an HiAP approach involving many related sectors, new resources and new technologies, and financing equal to the task at hand.

However, the pace must be rapidly accelerated to assure the future health and well-being of populations across the globe, prioritizing the most vulnerable communities not only in high-income countries but also in low- and middle-income countries. To achieve this acceleration, tailored resources that can be used in teaching climate change and health must be developed and integrated into the core curricula of public health physicians, nurses and other health workers as a priority.
