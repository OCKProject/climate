<p class="p">However, no matter how quickly the world can reduce carbon emissions, inertia in the earthâ€™s climate system commits us to some extent to endure the consequences of ongoing anthropogenic climate change. Adapting to our changing climate is essential if hard-won health gains are not to be lost to sea level rise and a warmer, more extreme climate. Modelling the future climate has been essential to the development of climate change mitigation strategies, and adaptation strategies are also dependent on some advance knowledge of the future climate. One challenge for decision-makers is that while mitigation is a global phenomenon (reducing carbon emissions in any part of the world would have a collective benefit for everyone), adaptation is a local necessity. Health decision-makers must understand specific health consequences of responses to climate change, as experienced by beneficiaries of the local health system, often at the district level or below. And climate is complex. It behaves differently according to climate region and local geography, and varies by spatial distance and on multiple timescales. The current mixing of climate variability and signals of longer-term change [
