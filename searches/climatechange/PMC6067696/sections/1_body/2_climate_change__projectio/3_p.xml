<p class="p">New studies in this issue of 
 <italic class="italic">PLOS Medicine</italic> also show interlinkages and trade-offs between interventions for adaptation and mitigation. For example, Achebak and colleagues show that mortality during summer in Spain is declining in the face of an increasing number of heat waves [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002628.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The presumption is that technologies or adaptive behavior are advancing and making people less likely to die during a heat wave. But a study focused on the US [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002628.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] shows the potential for increased usage of air conditioning to cause additional morbidity and mortality if electricity is still generated in part from coal-fired power plants. In addition, pursuing a low-carbon economy will require vigilance to ensure that some populations are not disadvantaged, as Cushing and colleagues report on air-pollution inequities emerging from a carbon-pricing policy in California [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002628.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. These new studies highlight potential unintended consequences of both adaptation and mitigation measures and require us to take a systems approach to every intervention to avoid trading one health problem for another.
