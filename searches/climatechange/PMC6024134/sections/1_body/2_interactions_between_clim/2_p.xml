<p class="p">While climate change alone is a major threat to coral reefs, it cannot be considered in isolation when local human activities are severely damaging coral reef ecosystems (Burke, McManus, Spalding, &amp; Perry, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Halpern et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34146-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). These include direct damage and sedimentation from coastal development, pollution from land‐use change, increased nutrients from agriculture, invasive species, overfishing and destructive fishing practices (Burke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). These factors exacerbate the negative impacts of climate change on coral reefs through direct destruction of reefs and their structural complexity, increased bleaching susceptibility of corals, reduced coral recruitment and growth, and increased disease prevalence (Ateweberhan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Bijma, Portner, Yesson, &amp; Rogers, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Halpern et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0087" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Table 
 <xref rid="ece34146-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> provides some key examples of these harmful interactions for four major threats of sedimentation, nutrient enrichment, overfishing and destructive fishing. Due to these additional pressures, reefs are becoming less resistant to chronic climate change stressors, and are less able to recover from related disturbances such as bleaching, storms and CoTS outbreaks (Anthony et al.,
