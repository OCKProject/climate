<p class="p">These interacting factors may be antagonistic (the combined impact is less than the sum of their individual impacts), additive (the combined impact is equal to the sum of individual impacts) or synergistic (the combined impact exceeds the sum of individual impacts) (Ban, Graham, &amp; Connolly,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) synthesised all available studies on interactions between two or more stressors on coral reefs, finding that sedimentation, storms and temperature influenced the highest number of other stressors, while the most‐influenced stressors were nutrients, CoTS and pathogens. Most stressor‐stressor interactions were either additive or synergistic.
