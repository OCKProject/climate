<p class="p">However, there are still very little data on most interactions, especially those where variables are not easy to control, such as fishing effort as this is often unmonitored (Ban et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Disentangling the interacting impacts of a variety of stressors on such a complicated ecosystem is highly challenging and may not be possible (Côté, Darling, &amp; Brown, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). More research is needed to understand interactions between stressors, especially those which most influence other stressors, to enable more effective management prioritisation to mitigate against the most severe impacts of climate change and human activities on coral reef ecosystems (Ban et al.,
