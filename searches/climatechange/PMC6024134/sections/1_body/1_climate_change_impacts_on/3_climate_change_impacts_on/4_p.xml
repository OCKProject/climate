<p class="p">Ocean acidification impacts corals and reef organisms through different mechanisms than warming. Corals themselves are vulnerable to OA because they require carbonate ions in aragonite form to build their calcium carbonate skeletons; as availability of aragonite decreases so do calcification and growth rates, leading to fragile structures (Doney et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0166" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). A laboratory study has shown that in addition to reducing calcification, a pH of 7.7 also deformed the skeletal structures of juvenile corals (Foster, Falter, McCulloch, &amp; Clode,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), possibly influenced by the mass bleaching events; from 1947 to 2008 inner reefs on the GBR calcification have declined steadily by 0.6% per decade (D’Olivo, McCulloch, &amp; Judd,
