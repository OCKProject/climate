<p class="p">Tropical marine organisms generally have narrower ranges of thermal tolerance and exist nearer their upper thermal limits than temperate species (Rummer &amp; Munday, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Temperatures approaching thermal limits have physiological implications for organisms, including increased metabolic rates and reduced aerobic scope, development and growth (Doney et al.,
