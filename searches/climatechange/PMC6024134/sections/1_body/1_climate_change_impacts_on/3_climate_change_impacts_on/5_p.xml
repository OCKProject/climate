<p class="p">By 2050, reefs are predicted to erode at a faster rate than they can be built, causing net reef dissolution (Silverman, Lazar, Cao, Caldeira, &amp; Erez, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0155" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). OA reduces coral larvae growth rates leading to higher mortality and lower recruitment (Doropoulos, Ward, Marshell, Diaz‐Pulido, &amp; Mumby, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Munday et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0126" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The coralline algae on which coral larvae preferentially settle are sensitive to low pH (Doney et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and there is evidence that the cues by which coral and fish larvae identify settlement sites are disrupted, suggesting further negative impacts on recruitment (Doropoulos, Ward, Diaz‐Pulido, et al.,
