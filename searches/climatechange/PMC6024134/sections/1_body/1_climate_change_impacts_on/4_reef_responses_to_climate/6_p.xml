<p class="p">Organism responses to climate change such as reduced reproductive capacity in fish due to warming can have population‐level consequences (Rummer &amp; Munday, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0149" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), while species‐specific responses to climate change such as differential adaptation and dispersal potential result in altered biotic interactions, trophic cascades, loss of key species and disruption of metapopulation dynamics, impacting on populations and communities (Doney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Graham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; see Figure

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0084" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Climate change also influences biotic interactions with negative consequences for coral: OA accelerated bioerosion of coral by a sponge (

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0173" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), while increasing temperatures by 2°C promoted 4.2–4.9 times higher recruitment (and therefore coral predation) by coral crown‐of‐thorns starfish (
 <italic class="italic">Acanthaster planci</italic> or CoTS), a major issue in the GBR (Uthicke et al.,
