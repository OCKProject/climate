<p class="p">One method of acclimation is a change in the coral–algae symbiosis to more heat‐resistant algae (Parmesan, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0138" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Experimentally bleached corals recovered with a higher proportion (&gt;90%) of stress‐tolerant symbiotic algae, reducing damage in subsequent bleaching events (Silverstein et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0156" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). It is unknown however whether this is enough to support coral survival under highly stressful conditions, or whether the unprecedented rate of environmental change is too rapid to enable successful adaptation or acclimation (Hoegh‐Guldberg,
