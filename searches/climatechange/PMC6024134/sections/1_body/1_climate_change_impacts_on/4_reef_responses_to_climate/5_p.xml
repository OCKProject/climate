<p class="p">Climate change also impacts on coral reef ecosystems through the interactions of individuals, populations and communities (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34146-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Corals are ecosystem engineers upon which the entire reef community depend: they build the ecosystem framework, providing habitat for other organisms (Wild et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0171" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The loss of habitat structural complexity due to coral reef dissolution and frequent bleaching can reduce the prevalence of other groups of organisms (Fabricius, De’ath, Noonan, &amp; Uthicke,
