<p class="p">These climate change‐associated changes in community composition and biodiversity of coral reefs can ultimately lead to regime shifts or “novel ecosystems”, either non‐coral ecosystems or alternative coral communities dominated by thermally resistant species (Graham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). While exactly predicting regime shifts is challenging, there are several conditions known to reduce coral reef resilience including herbivore removal, low reef structural complexity and high nutrient concentrations (Fabricius,
