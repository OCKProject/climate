<p class="p">We review recent advances in our understanding of the impacts of ocean warming, acidification and other anthropogenic pressures on coral reef ecosystems, including organism and community responses to their changing environments. We argue the need to integrate ecosystem‐based management and resilience thinking, and then review management and governance strategies for coral reefs under future environmental change. These include the need for climate‐ready marine protected areas (MPAs), alternative mechanisms for reducing local anthropogenic stressors, active management, participatory conservation strategies and marine spatial planning (MSP). We provide an overview of the huge conservation effort necessary to preserve coral reefs and their ecosystem services, and support the communities dependent upon them.</p>
