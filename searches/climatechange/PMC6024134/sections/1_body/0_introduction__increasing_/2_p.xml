<p class="p">Coral reefs are extremely diverse and valuable ecosystems, providing habitat for a third of marine species in just 0.2% of the ocean (Pandolfi, Connolly, Marshall, &amp; Cohen, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). They provide important ecosystem services to over 450 million people living within 100 km of them (Crabbe,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0137" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), including fisheries, tourism, building materials, and protection from storm waves and coastal erosion. As such, they are valued at US$350,000 per year for an “average” hectare of coral reef (De Groot et al.,
