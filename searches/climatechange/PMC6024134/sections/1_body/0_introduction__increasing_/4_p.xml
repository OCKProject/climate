<p class="p">The amount of carbon dioxide (CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) in the atmosphere has increased from 280 to ~405 ppm since the industrial revolution (Dlugokencky &amp; Tans, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), despite a third of all emissions having been absorbed by the oceans (Feely, Doney, &amp; Cooley, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). There are two overarching effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and other greenhouse gas emissions on marine systems. First, upper oceans have already been warmed by 0.11°C per decade between 1971 and 2010 (Rhein et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0142" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), and by 2100 the average temperature is predicted to have increased by 12°C (Scott, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0152" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). There are likely to be more frequent extreme high‐temperature events, such as those associated with El Niño‐southern oscillation (ENSO) (Frieler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Second, increased emissions have caused lower ocean pH, decreased carbonate ion concentrations and reduced the saturation state of aragonite (Ωa)—together known as “ocean acidification” (OA) (Doney, Fabry, Feely, &amp; Kleypas, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Orr et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). pH has already declined by 0.1 units (Doney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Orr et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Yeakel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0177" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), with a further reduction of 0.3–0.4 units predicted by 2,100 (Feely et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Orr et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0136" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Furthermore, on a more localised scale, tropical storms are predicted to increase in frequency and intensity due to climate change. Such storms can cause devastating damage to coral reefs, for example accounting for 42% of the coral loss in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) from 1985 to 2012 (De’ath, Fabricius, Sweatman, &amp; Puotinen, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Emanuel, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>).
