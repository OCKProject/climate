<p class="p">Coral reefs are severely threatened by a suite of human‐induced stressors at local and global scales. Ecosystem‐based management combined with resilience thinking can be used to better effect than approaches which do not take into account the multi‐use, complex social‐ecological nature of coral reef systems. Improving MPA design to enable coral reef organisms to adapt, acclimate or disperse under climate change is necessary but not sufficient: a range of other conservation tools will need to be employed including management of external stressors, alternative fisheries restrictions, novel approaches such as active restoration, inclusion of social–ecological factors and action on multiple scales. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34146-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> summarises various management strategies aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change and local human activities, facilitating positive responses to them via acclimation, adaptation or dispersal, and sustaining ecosystem services and functioning to maintain the resilience of social‐ecological systems.
