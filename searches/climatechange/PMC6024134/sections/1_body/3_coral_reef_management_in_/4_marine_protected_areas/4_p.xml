<p class="p">New MPAs should protect key areas under a range of future environmental scenarios. Key areas include locations where change is more gradual (“climate refugia”), ecologically important areas including fish spawning aggregations, and areas predicted to be more resilient in the long‐term, such as those with high herbivore populations and low sedimentation (Ban et al.,
