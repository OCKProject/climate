<p class="p">The efficacy of current MPAs is debatable. A meta‐analysis of 310 MPAs found coral cover remained stable within MPAs but declined in fished areas outside, while marine reserves can successfully maintain reef fish biomass, but only in high compliance with MPA regulations (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A recent study in the GBR suggests MPAs can increase coral reef resilience to natural disturbances exacerbated by climate change, such as coral bleaching, disease and storms (Mellin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), while in the Seychelles recovery after a bleaching event was faster within MPAs provided macroalgal cover was low (Wilson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0172" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, several studies have not shown measurable positive impacts (Bruno &amp; Valdivia,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0080" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0153" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and many MPAs are small, with low enforcement and compliance, and as such do not achieve management objectives (Norström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Sale et al.,
