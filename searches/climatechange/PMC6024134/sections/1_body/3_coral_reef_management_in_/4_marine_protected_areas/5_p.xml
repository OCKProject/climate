<p class="p">Small, unconnected MPAs are unsustainable as the surrounding seascape also needs to be managed, often in MPA networks (McLeod et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). MPA networks in particular should replicate habitat types within them (“spreading risk”), maintain ecological connectivity to facilitate recruitment and dispersal, and sustain not just biodiversity but ecosystem functioning and services, and key functional groups such as herbivorous fish (Groves et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lawler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; McLeod et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0125" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). MPA placement should therefore reflect both current and future species distributions where ranges are expected to change, to facilitate dispersal (Makino et al.,
