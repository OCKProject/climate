<p class="p">Implementing MPAs that have been effectively designed to meet climate change objectives is not always sufficient because implementation does not always equate to compliance (McClanahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). A total of 70% of coral reefs are found in developing nations with low enforcement capacity (Ban et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>); thus, MPAs may suffer from poor compliance (McClanahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0119" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), which can have serious consequences for their effectiveness (McClanahan &amp; Graham, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Including local stakeholders in MPA planning and design may drive improved levels of compliance and improve reef resilience outcomes (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Bottom‐up, participatory management and conservation approaches that account for the local context are central to successful management outcomes on many coral reefs, particularly in developing nations (Christie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Norström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
