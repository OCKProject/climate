<p class="p">Given limited conservation resources (McCarthy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0114" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and the time needed to produce positive benefits within MPAs (McClanahan &amp; Graham, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0116" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), investing in MPAs without considering future threats may result in them becoming less effective over time (McLeod, Salm, Green, &amp; Almany, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). If MPAs are to support the resilience of coral reefs in the face of climate change, providing time for acclimation, adaptation or dispersal by reef species, forward looking design is critical (Ban et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Lawler, Watson, &amp; Game, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; McLeod et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0121" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although research has highlighted general characteristics of effective MPAs today (no‐take, enforced, old, large and isolated) (Edgar et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), other factors need to be considered in a high‐CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> world. MPA design needs to address future scenarios in addition to present issues (Makino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0113" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0112" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
