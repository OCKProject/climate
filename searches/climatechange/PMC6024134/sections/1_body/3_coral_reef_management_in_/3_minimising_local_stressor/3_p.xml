<p class="p">A long‐term (20 years), large‐scale (150,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) study of coral reef communities on the Great Barrier Reef provided strong evidence that reducing local anthropogenic impacts might make coral reefs more resilient to a range of stressors, including coral bleaching (Mellin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0122" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This was seen through 21%–38% higher stability of reef community composition, lower susceptibility to initial impacts, and 20% increased recovery times (Mellin et al.,

A simulation model for Bolinao in the Phillipines found that management of water quality, and to a lesser extent fishing, can significantly improve reef state under future climate change scenarios, by enhancing recovery after bleaching events (Gurney, Melbourne‐Thomas, Geronimo, Alino, &amp; Johnson,
