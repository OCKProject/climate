<p class="p">On eliminating fishing in protected areas, reef resilience may be increased through a number of mechanisms: herbivory, reduced coral predation, maintaining structural complexity and increased response diversity, and promoting recovery from bleaching events (Adam, Burkepile, Ruttenberg, &amp; Paddack,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), but enforcement is often limited and reserves do not fulfil their function (McClanahan, Marnane, Cinner, &amp; Kiene,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Determining the carrying capacity of fish biomass in relation to environmental and anthropogenic variables could help managers to develop reference levels that would reduce trade‐offs between fisheries’ objectives and the protection of reef function (Valdivia, Cox, &amp; Bruno,
