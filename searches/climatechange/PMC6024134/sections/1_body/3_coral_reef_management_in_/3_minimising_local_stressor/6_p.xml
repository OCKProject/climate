<p class="p">Alternative fishing restrictions, such as controlling species caught, fishing gear and access, and seasonal closures of breeding sites, can be successful at sustaining fish biomass while maintaining key ecosystem functions such as herbivory (Burke et al.,

Setting fisheries targets is challenging due to the multiple species with diverse ecological functions, however total catch biomass alone can provide easy, effective targets where more information is not available (McClanahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Climate change and certain fishing gears may simultaneously select for functionally important species. For example, spear guns target specific herbivorous species that are susceptible to climate change, and as a result, restrictions on spear‐guns could be a targeted strategy for supporting reefs under pressure from climate change (Cinner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). A key challenge is the quantification of the full suite of ecological, social and economic trade‐offs associated with changes in any of the management levers that are used, but this could be addressed using management strategy evaluation (Fulton, Smith, Smith, &amp; Johnson,
