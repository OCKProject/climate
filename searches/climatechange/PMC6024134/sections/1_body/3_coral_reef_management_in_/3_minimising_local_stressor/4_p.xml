<p class="p">Increasing water quality through minimising sedimentation and nutrient enrichment could improve ecosystem health within decades (Fabricius, De’ath, McCook, Turak, &amp; Williams, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Better watershed management through improved agricultural practices near rivers, restoration of riparian reserves along rivers and of coastal floodplains and returning to more natural flow regimes could reduce run‐off and nutrient enrichment (Kroon, Schaffelke, &amp; Bartley, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Regulation of waste water could reduce bleaching severity (Wagner, Kramer, &amp; Van Woesik, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0168" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), while minimising sedimentation should reduce coral diseases (Pollock et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0140" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and decreasing nutrient loads could allow more time for the adaptation of the coral–zooxanthellae symbiosis to global change (Wooldridge,
