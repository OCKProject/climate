<p class="p">The concept of resilience has been advocated and can be used to support the design and implementation of EBM (Hughes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Ecological resilience can be defined as the ability of an ecosystem to maintain the same structure and functioning in a changing environment, including resistance to stress and recovery from disturbances (Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; McClanahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). One of the benefits of embedding this framework into EBM for reefs is that resilience of coral reefs has been relatively well studied, for example, in the context of recovery following disturbance events such as bleaching (Anthony, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and socio‐ecological resilience (Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Kittinger, Finkbeiner, Glazier, &amp; Crowder, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0106" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Vulnerability frameworks that integrate across ecological, social and economic aspects of coral reefs are an important part of developing adaptive and more integrated ecosystem management strategies under climate change (Cinner, Huchery, et al.,
