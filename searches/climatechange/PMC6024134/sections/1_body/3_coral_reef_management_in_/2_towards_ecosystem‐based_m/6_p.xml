<p class="p">In the context of climate change, changes in underlying reef resilience could also occur if key recovery processes (such as recruitment, growth or dispersal) are impacted by climate change (Anthony, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Management strategies could therefore enhance resilience to ongoing stressors (e.g., warming, sedimentation) and act directly to reduce the impacts of disturbances, such as control of CoTS (Anthony et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Reducing local drivers of coral reef decline may increase the chances of re‐establishment of coral‐dominated reefs from degraded reefs which are themselves resistant to change (Graham et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Maintaining resilience also means retaining diversity and functional redundancy in the face of change, managing ecosystem connectivity, understanding and managing feedbacks, and promoting social principles including encouraging education, broadening participation and advocating integration of multiple stakeholders (Biggs et al.,
