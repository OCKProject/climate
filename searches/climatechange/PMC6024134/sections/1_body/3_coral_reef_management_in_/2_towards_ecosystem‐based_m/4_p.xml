<p class="p">There is increasing recognition that coral reef management has been unable to halt degradation, and that returning to “pristine” conditions is an unrealistic goal (Abelson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0145" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), particularly in the context of changing environmental conditions. Conservation is moving away from this more traditional approach, as research seeks to provide conservation practitioners with a more diverse toolbox, including a range of indicators (Nash &amp; Graham, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0129" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and modelling frameworks (McClanahan et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0115" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The focus of management has changed from individual species and selected reefs, to management of the whole seascape, as the complexity of reef ecosystem responses to climate change and local human stressors has been realised (McClanahan, Graham, Macneil, &amp; Cinner, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0118" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Olsson, Folke, &amp; Hughes, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0135" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Weijerman et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0169" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Ecosystem‐based management (EBM) is a more holistic framework, incorporating interactions within ecosystems and socialecological links, impacts of multiple stressors on key functional groups and ecosystem processes, with the goal of maintaining ecosystem functioning and services (Levin &amp; Lubchenco, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0110" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>).
