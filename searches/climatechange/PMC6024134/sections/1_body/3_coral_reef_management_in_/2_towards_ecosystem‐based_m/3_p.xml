<p class="p">Marine protected areas or no‐take marine reserves are the most common form of reef management, focusing predominantly on reducing local anthropogenic pressures (Agardy, di Sciara, &amp; Christie,

These MPAs cost little to designate but may not be effective or representative (Jones &amp; De Santo, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). They do not protect the most threatened reefs—those associated with high human population densities—nor address social issues such as maintaining ecosystem services for those reliant on reefs for food or income (Sale et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Their designation should not divert attention from management of more damaged coral reefs in highly populated areas.
