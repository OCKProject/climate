<p class="p">On degraded reefs, removal of human pressures may be insufficient to facilitate recovery to coral‐dominated ecosystems, suggesting that active reef restoration may be necessary to maintain healthy ecosystems more resilient to climate change (Abelson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Introducing artificial complexity to replace the lost habitat structures of low complexity reefs, for example due to acidification, has been successful at small scales such as in the Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea (Al‐Horani &amp; Khalaf,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Coral “gardening”, where corals are farmed in mid‐water structures then transplanted to colonies, has been successful, leading to increased reproduction and larval dispersal (Rinkevich, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0144" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), for example, a 35% increase in oocyte production in farmed coral in Eilat, Red Sea (Amar &amp; Rinkevich, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Furthermore, coral transplantation could be used to reduce tourism exposure to natural reefs (Rogers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0148" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). These techniques are unlikely to provide larger‐scale solutions, yet can be effective locally.
