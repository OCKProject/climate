<p class="p">Human‐assisted evolution of coral reef organisms is another novel management tool, whereby genetically modified stress‐tolerant corals are transplanted onto reefs (Anthony,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0164" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This could also increase organisms’ resilience to environmental change by increasing resistance to stressors such as warming and acidification, and recovery from disturbances (van Oppen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, it could lead to a monopoly of a few resistant species, reducing overall biodiversity (Anthony,
