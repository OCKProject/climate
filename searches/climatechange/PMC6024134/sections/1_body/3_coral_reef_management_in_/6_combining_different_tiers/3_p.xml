<p class="p">Reducing dependency on fishing is imperative to protecting coral reefs, but highly challenging in societies with population growth, a lack of alternative income sources and poor governance (Burke et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Newton, Côté, Pilling, Jennings, &amp; Dulvy, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0131" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). These factors cannot be managed by conservation practitioners; however, management strategies built upon access rights, particularly, customary tenure are gaining traction (Christie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Jupiter, Cohen, Weeks, Tawake, &amp; Govan, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). A key study of over 2,500 reefs globally showed that reefs doing better than predicted from their environmental and social context commonly had customary management schemes and marine tenure (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In contrast, reefs doing worse than predicted had technological commonalities such as intensive netting methods (Cinner, Huchery, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). These findings suggest reef management may benefit from integrating customary and/or marine tenure arrangements, and gear restrictions rather than focusing solely on MPAs. These arrangements arise within indigenous communities or kinship groups and restrict certain behaviours, for example fishing at specific times or locations. Importantly, these restrictions may support key reef functions and processes, with positive implications for coral reef resilience (Aswani, Albert, Sabetian, &amp; Furusawa,
