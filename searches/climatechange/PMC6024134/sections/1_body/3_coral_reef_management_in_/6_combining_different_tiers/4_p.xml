<p class="p">Further considerations often overlooked are large‐scale or “distal” human drivers of coral reef degradation, which influence local anthropogenic threats such as fishing and pollution (Hughes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). These include international demand for certain species for food or the aquarium trade; increasing human migration (which may be exacerbated by climate change); foreign investments driving land use change; and changing fishing effort (Cinner, Graham, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Norström et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0132" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Rhyne et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Broader management strategies, especially marine spatial planning, need to be used to combat these external drivers. MSP incorporates MPAs and zoning, supports key ecosystem services, and separates conflicting uses of marine resources, for example by dividing coastal waters for different activities (e.g., conservation, food security and livelihoods) and integrating local and regional targets (Agardy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Sale et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This approach compensates for many of the deficits of MPAs on their own, incorporating them into a broader system of management and preventing degradation of surrounding areas (Agardy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). It should also reduce conflicts, maintain ecosystem services, and can facilitate rights‐based governance (Sale et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0150" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For instance, models for a national spatial plan for Belize which quantified ecosystem services led to a 25% increase in coastal protection with increases in tourism and doubling of fishing revenue when contrasted with models only including stakeholder views (Arkema et al.,
