<p class="p">Conservation management cannot focus solely on biodiversity measures or maintaining pristine reefs in remote locations. Six million fishers from nearly 100 countries rely on coral reefs for their livelihoods (Teh, Teh, &amp; Sumaila, 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0159" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>); therefore, management needs to support the resilience of both coral reefs and the communities that depend on them (Anthony et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Climate change impacts on reef social‐ecological systems are bi‐directional: how climate change impacts on communities determines how they then interact with the environment. For example, if climate change and local human pressures reduce local fish populations, will fishers look further afield for more fish, or turn to alternative incomes (Cinner, Pratchett, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34146-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>)? Such impacts are poorly understood, so the resilience of social‐ecological systems to climate change cannot be predicted.
