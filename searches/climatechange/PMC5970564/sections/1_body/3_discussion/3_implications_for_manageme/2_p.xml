<p class="p">First, identifying the areas experiencing climate change is a critical step (

Forecasting future areas of invasion by SDM provides an opportunity for governments to prioritize those regions for management and then develop strategies to control pests in these areas. For example, our results suggest that CAS has a highly suitable environment in southern China, which has severely harmed

 <italic class="italic">Cycas guizhouensis</italic> in Guizhou Province (
 <xref rid="ref-78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu, Li &amp; Luo, 2008</xref>); however, unfortunately, no management strategy for controlling this pest is exists in these region. Moreover, some regions, such as western Australia, northern New Zealand, western Madagascar, southern Brazil, Uruguay and north-eastern Argentina, were identified as having suitable habitat for the CAS in our work. Therefore, these areas should formulate strict quarantine measures to prevent invasion by this pest.
