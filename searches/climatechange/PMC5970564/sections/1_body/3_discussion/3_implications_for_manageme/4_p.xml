<p class="p">Finally, natural enemies are likely another effective way to control CAS. The first biological control agents, a parasitic wasp, 
 <italic class="italic">Coccobius fulvus</italic> and a predatory beetle, 
 <italic class="italic">Cybocephalus nipponicus</italic>, were released in 1998 (

 <italic class="italic">Cybocephalus nipponicus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">C. flavocapitis</italic> are effective biological control agents of CAS in Taiwan Province, China (

 <italic class="italic">Coccobius fulvus</italic> individuals were released in 14 Florida counties during Februaryâ€“April 2002, and good CAS control results were observed (
