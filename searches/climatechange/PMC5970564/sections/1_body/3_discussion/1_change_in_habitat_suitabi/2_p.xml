<p class="p">However, not all regions showed an expansion of the potential distribution range under climate change. Based on two climate scenarios, the current research showed that climate change will reduce the risk of invasion on some continents, such as Africa and previous studies have also suggested that some invasive species are likely to experience range reductions due to climate change (

Retreat by invasive pests could lead to opportunities for the restoration of currently invaded landscapes, but further research is needed to identify these opportunities and provide sound guidance for ecological restoration.
