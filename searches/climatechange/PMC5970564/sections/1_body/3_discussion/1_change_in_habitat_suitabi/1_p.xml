<p class="p">In this paper, the potential distribution of the invasive CAS was first simulated using MaxEnt and presence data. The CAS is native to Thailand and has already invaded other continents. The results of the simulation of the potential distribution of this invasive scale insect showed that climate change would affect its worldwide distribution. Our model also suggests that the CAS has a high invasive potential and is capable of invading large portions of the global landmass on several continents, particularly in South China, North India, north-western Africa and some areas of Russia. The occurrence of unsuitable areas on the current distribution map of

This pest is already causing serious damage to the mature leaves and trunks of many cycad species (

Interestingly, our results suggests that western Australia, northern New Zealand, western Madagascar, southern Brazil, Uruguay and northeastern Argentina have suitable habitat for this pest; however, fortunately, there have not been any reports of its presence at these sites. Thus, strict quarantine measures should be enforced across these regions to prohibit the spread of this pest from its invasive and native ranges. The potential distribution map for this pest provides a reference for developing monitoring strategies to detect future infestations in currently uninfected regions.
