<p class="p">The current distribution pattern of 
 <italic class="italic">A. yasumatsui</italic> based on the current environmental variables and occurrence records (including invasive records and native records) is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>. The current climatic variables in the invasive range of the pest, as predict from MaxEnt, were used to identify potential distribution areas around the world, which were especially concentrated in North America, South America, Europe and Asia. In the USA, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana and Texas had high invasion risks under the current climate scenario and areas with moderate invasion probabilities were also found in eastern Mexico. In addition, the Hawaiian Islands were also identified as having high potential distribution areas on the current map. In Europe, moderate-risk areas included France and Italy. In Asia, India, South China, Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan as well as portions of eastern Laos and Indonesia were the areas with the highest risk on the current potential distribution map. In Africa, the potential distribution area will extend to the east of Africa. Based on current climatic variables, the total area of potential suitable habitat for this pest is approximately 46,432,375 km
