 <xref ref-type="table" rid="table-1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These two factors could explain 74.8% of the modeled distribution. The contributions of the other factors, i.e., Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (Bio19), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (Bio8), Mean Diurnal Range (Bio2) and Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (Bio15) had contributions of the model were 15.2%, 6.8%, 2.7% and 0.5%, respectively, to the model. It appeared thermal conditions and topography were more important than other variables in creating the distribution map for this pest.
