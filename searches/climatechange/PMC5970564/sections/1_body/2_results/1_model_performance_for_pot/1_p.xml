<p class="p">The model performance for 
 <italic class="italic">A. yasumatsui</italic> was better than random based on 10-fold cross validation, with a mean AUC value of 0.939 ± 0.02 and a TSS value of 0.701 ± 0.11. A “maximum training sensitivity plus specificity” threshold value of 0.112 was obtained from the 10th percentile training presence of the species occurrences. The suitable habitat areas for the pest were reclassified into four levels: &lt;0.112 which indicated unsuitable habitat (no risk); 0.112–0.4, which indicated low habitat suitability (low risk); 0.4–0.6, which indicated moderate habitat suitability (medium risk); and &gt;0.6, which indicated high habitat suitability (high risk).
