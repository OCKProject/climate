<p class="p">Invasive species are considered a major threat to ecosystem functioning and native biodiversity. Climate changes can enhance invasion processes from initial introduction through establishment and spread, and consequently have a profound influence on agricultural systems. The CAS is one of the most serious pests of cycads that has emerged in recent years. This study provided the first potential distribution map based on current and future climate scenarios, and the result showed that the potentially suitable habitat area or CAS is far greater than the current distribution under current climate conditions. The amount of suitable habitats will continue to increase under future climate change scenarios. The present study only provides a reference to the manage this invasive species and develop policies for its control; thus, further research is required.</p>
