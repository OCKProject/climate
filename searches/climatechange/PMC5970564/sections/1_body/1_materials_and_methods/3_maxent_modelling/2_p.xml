<p class="p">Building models from MaxEnt with an appropriate amount of complexity for the study objectives is critical for robust inference (
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Merow et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, for several reasons, the default settings of MaxEnt are expected to produce overfit models (
 <xref rid="ref-55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Radosavijevic &amp; Anderson, 2014</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of both balancing model complexity and predictive power and evaluating model’s performance with spatially independent data. Hence, in order to produce the best possible model for CAS, avoiding overfitting while maximizing predictive power, we employed the R package ENMeval to select the optimal combination of two important MaxEnt’s parameters, the value of the regularization multiplier and the combination of feature classes (

In this study, the “checkerboard2” approach was used by calculating the standardized Akaike information criterion coefficient (AICc), and the parameterizations that resulted in the model with the lowest delta AICc score were selected to run the final MaxEnt models. The regularization multiplier was varied from 0.5 to 4 in increments of 0.5, and the following six feature combinations were tested: (1) Linear (L); (2) Linear (L) and Quadratic (Q); (3) Hinge (H); (4) Linear (L), Quadratic (Q) and Hinge (H); (5) Linear (L), Quadratic (Q), Hinge (H) and Product (P); (6) Linear (L), Quadratic(Q), Hinge (H), Product (P) and Threshold (T). The ENMeval package were implemented in R 3.1.3 (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-1" class="xref">Fig. S1</xref>. Thus, a regularization multiplier = 2.5; feature combinations = Linear, Quadratic and Hinge (LQH) were choose in final MaxEnt configuration. Background points were randomly chosen within the area enclosed by a minimum convex polygon comprising all records of the species of interest as suggested by 
 <xref rid="ref-52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips (2008)</xref>. The logistic output of MaxEnt was used for all the analyses. The 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold was used to define the suitable and unsuitable habitats for CAS. This threshold is a conservative value that is widely adopted in species distribution modelling, especially when data have been collected by different observers and have been collected using different methods over a long time (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bosso et al., 2016</xref>). By applying this threshold, binary presence/absence maps were created using the reclassify module from ArcGIS 10.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). To maximize the predictive information and simplification of future analysis, the suitable habitat areas for CAS were reclassified into four levels: unsuitable habitat (no risk), low habitat suitability (low risk), moderate habitat suitability (medium risk) and high habitat suitability (high risk). The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fielding &amp; Bell, 1997</xref>) and the true skill statistic (TSS; sensitivity + specificity − 1) (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Allouche, Tsoar &amp; Kadmon, 2006</xref>) were used to estimate the performance of the model according to 
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Swets (1988)</xref>. The AUC value ranges from 0 to 1, where a value below 0.5 can be interpreted as a random prediction; 0.5–0.7 indicates poor model performance; 0.7–0.9 indicates moderate performance; and a value above 0.9 is considered to have “good” discrimination abilities (
 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peterson et al., 2011</xref>). The TSS accounts for both omission and commission errors, and the value range from −1 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect agreement and 0 represents a random fit. Excellent model performances are expressed by TSS values close to 1 (
