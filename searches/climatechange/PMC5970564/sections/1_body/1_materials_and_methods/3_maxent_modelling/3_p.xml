<p class="p">A 10-fold cross-validation was used to run MaxEnt to prevent random errors from affecting the selection of the validation and prediction sample. To assess the influence of environmental variables on species, the jackknife test was used to measure the importance and the percent contributions of each variable. To account for variation among GCMs, a final projection environmental suitability map was created for CAS by averaging the projections from the all future climate scenarios.</p>
