<p class="p">The environmental variables used to characterize ecological niches were selected considering the climate and topography. Climatic variables are probably the main determinant of species niches at large scale (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Luoto, Virkkala &amp; Heikkinen, 2007</xref>), and they have previously been used for insect niche modelling (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Medley, 2010</xref>). All environmental variables used in this study were download from the WorldClim Global Climate Database (

 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>), and current climate conditions were represented by minima, maxima and average values of monthly, quarterly and annual ambient temperatures as well as precipitation values recorded from 1950 to 2000. These parameters provided a combination of means, extremes and seasonal differences in variables known to influence species distribution (
 <xref rid="ref-59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Root et al., 2003</xref>). Topographic variables represented by altitude (ALT) were derived from HYDRO1K (

 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Heikkinen et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, principal component analysis (PCA) in SPSS Statistics was performed to remove highly correlated variables (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-8" class="xref">Table S3</xref>). Finally, six climatic environmental and topographic variables were selected: Mean Diurnal Range (Mean of monthly (max temp–min temp)) (Bio2), Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (Bio8), Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter (Bio9), Precipitation Seasonality (Coefficient of Variation) (Bio15), Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (Bio19) and Altitude (ALT).
