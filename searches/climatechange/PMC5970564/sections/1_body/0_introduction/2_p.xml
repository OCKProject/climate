<p class="p">Cycads (Cycadales), commonly called “sago palms”, are considered as the most primitive extant seed plant lineage and are often characterized as “living fossils” (
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marler &amp; Moore, 2010</xref>) due to their long evolutionary history (
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brenner, Stevenson &amp; Twigg, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Salas-Leiva et al., 2013</xref>). There are 348 extant species of cycads, and almost all are threatened or endangered (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Normark et al., 2017</xref>). At present, cycads are popular landscape plants in tropical and subtropical areas because they are long-lived and require little maintenance (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bailey, Chang &amp; Lai, 2011</xref>). However, many cycad species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Cycad micronesica</italic>, are facing extinction in the wild due to insect pests (e.g., the cycad blue butterfly) (
 <xref rid="ref-79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al., 2010</xref>) and microbial pathogens (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nesamari et al., 2015</xref>). The cycad aulacaspis scale (CAS), 
 <italic class="italic">Aulacaspis yasumatsui</italic> Takagi (Hemiptera: Diaspididae), is one of the serious pest of cycads (
 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Giorgi &amp; Vandenberg, 2012</xref>). Studies have suggested that this highly invasive species poses a threat to costly ornamental and horticultural plants, but it also damages wild cycad populations, including plants in conservation areas around the world (
 <xref rid="ref-38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marler &amp; Lawrence, 2012</xref>). The CAS was first described from specimens collected in Bangkok, Thailand in 1972 by 
 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takagi (1977)</xref>, but the species usually occurs at low densities in its native range due to control by natural enemies (
 <xref rid="ref-68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tang, Yang &amp; Vatcharakorn, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marler &amp; Moore, 2010</xref>). To date, the CAS has spread to many areas outside of its native range. The first report of CAS on cycads outside Thailand was in 1996 in Florida, USA, where it infested ornamental plants and killed large numbers of king sago, 
 <italic class="italic">Cycas revoluta</italic> Thunberg (
 <xref rid="ref-32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howard et al., 1999</xref>); it was subsequently found in the Fairchild Tropical Garden and the Montgomery Botanical Center, both of which have collections of rare and endangered cycads. Following its introduction in Florida, the CAS spread to Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, South Carolina, and Texas (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haynes, 2005</xref>) and most recently, this pest was also reported in Mexico (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">González-Gómez et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Normark et al., 2017</xref>). The CAS has now been introduced to many countries including China (
 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bailey et al., 2010</xref>), Singapore (
 <xref rid="ref-31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hodgson &amp; Martin, 2001</xref>), Vietnam (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">EPPO, 2017</xref>) and Philippines in Asia; Guam (
 <xref rid="ref-70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Terry &amp; Marler, 2005</xref>), the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico, the Vieques Islands, and the Hawaiian Islands in the Americas; as well as in Africa (
 <xref rid="ref-47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nesamari et al., 2015</xref>); and Europe (
 <xref rid="ref-37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Malumphy &amp; Marquart, 2012</xref>); among other locations. Moreover, CAS was intercepted several times from France in 2001 (
 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Germain, 2002</xref>).
