<p class="p">Due to the damage caused by CAS, many cycads in southern Miami, area of Florida, died within a year, and mature cycads were killed in a matter of months (

 <xref rid="ref-67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takagi &amp; De faveri, 2009</xref>), and at the start of an infestation, damage initially appears as chlorotic spots on the undersides of leaves. As the infestation progresses, CAS infests the upper surfaces of the leaf and then occurs on the petioles as well as the stems and as the population density of the scale increases, infested plants become quickly and almost completely covered by live and dead scales and appear as enveloped a white crust (
