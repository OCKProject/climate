<p class="p">Based on empirical data from Florida and other regions, it is difficult to control CAS through any of the currently available methods (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muniappan et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, an alternative approach is to enforce strict quarantine measures in countries where CAS has not yet been introduced by prohibiting the importation of cycad plants from infested countries. Information regarding the potential distribution of this species under climate change will be indispensable for scientists and farmers around the world to develop future monitoring and management strategies for this pest (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jim√©nez-Valverde et al., 2011</xref>). In this paper, the current and future potential distributions of CAS were estimated based on available occurrence data using MaxEnt software. The mainly objectives were (1) to identify the main climatic variable that constrains the potential distribution of CAS, (2) to predict the trends of its suitable habitat range under different climatic change scenarios, and (3) to provide a theoretical reference framework for developing policy to manage and control this invasive pest.
