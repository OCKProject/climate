 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5" class="xref">Table 5</xref> shows the effects of adaptation, emissions, and climate modeling uncertainties on projected impacts. It compares the largest range in impacts from all the adaptation modeling methods we investigated with 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) the range in impacts from using 1 GCM run under two emissions scenarios without adaptation, and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) with the range in impacts from 5 GCMs run under one emissions scenario without adaptation. The range in impacts that arose from adaptation modeling uncertainty was greater than the range that arose because of emissions uncertainty for every city. It was also greater than the range that arose because of climate modeling uncertainty for 13 of 14 cities. These differences were considerable in some cases; for example, for Athens, Budapest, and Rome, the ranges due to adaptation uncertainty were 88, 80, and 80 deaths per 100,000, respectively, whereas for climate modeling uncertainty, they were 46, 57, and 45 deaths per 100,000 respectively.
