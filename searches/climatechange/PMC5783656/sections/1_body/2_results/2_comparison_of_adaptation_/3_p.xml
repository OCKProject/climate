<p class="p">For all cities, the range in impacts from using an absolute threshold shift was smaller than the range from using multiple GCMs and/or RCPs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). The ranges were larger when absolute threshold shifts were combined with reductions in ERF slope, but apart from three cities (Athens, Barcelona, and Valencia) the ranges were smaller than those from using multiple GCMs or RCPs. For all cities except Ljubljana and Valencia, the range in impacts from using analog ERFs was smaller than the range from using multiple GCMs and multiple RCPs (
