<p class="p">Combining a relative threshold shift with a reduction in the ERF was associated with the largest ranges in impacts across all the methods for all cities except Valencia. Relative threshold shifts were associated with the second-largest ranges in impacts. For example, with relative threshold shifts of 50% (100%),
