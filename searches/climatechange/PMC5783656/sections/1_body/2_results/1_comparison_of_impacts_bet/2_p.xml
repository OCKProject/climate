 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>, which shows, as a mean across all 14 cities, the range of the difference (percent) in impacts between including and excluding adaptation. The ranges are 49% (absolute threshold shift), 94% (relative threshold shift), 28% (reduction in slope of the ERF), 68% (absolute threshold shift combined with a reduction in slope of the ERF), 103% (relative threshold shift combined with a reduction in slope of the ERF), and 76% (analog ERF).
