<p class="p">To address these important research gaps, our study had three main objectives. Firstly, we conducted the first systematic comparison of the range in projected impacts that arises from using different adaptation modeling methods employed in previous studies; secondly, we compared the range in impacts that arises from adaptation uncertainty (i.e., impacts with the inclusion/exclusion of adaptation) to the respective ranges from climate modeling and emissions uncertainty; and thirdly, we aimed to provide the first recommendation of one or several adaptation modeling methods to use in future impact assessments.</p>
