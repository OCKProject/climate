<p class="p">Variation in the magnitude of observed declines in sensitivity to heat has limited the ability of researchers to investigate the effects of adaptation assumptions on projections of the impact of climate change. Thus, some researchers have not considered adaptation effects at all (e.g.,

Such an approach, however, which ignores what we refer to here as “adaptation uncertainty” (i.e., the sensitivity of impacts to including and excluding adaptation modeling respectively), is acknowledged to likely overestimate impacts (
