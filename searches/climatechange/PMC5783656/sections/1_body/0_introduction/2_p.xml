<p class="p">Adaptation mechanisms may occur through autonomous adaptation, such as physiological acclimatization and a range of behavioral adaptations such as dressing appropriately during hot weather. They may also occur through planned adaptation, such as the introduction of government subsidies to increase air conditioning installations or the introduction of heat health warning systems, or through public responses via health services such as changing prescription patterns and arranging home visits. Attempts to combine both autonomous and planned adaptation to represent the whole range of adaptation mechanisms and then to factor them into quantitative assessments of the impact of climate change on heat-related mortality by statistical modeling are largely based on liberal assumptions on the extent to which populations will adapt (
