<p class="p">Within this context, a number of impact assessments have accounted for adaptation uncertainty by representing adaptation statistically in the modeling process, suggesting that impacts could be up to 30â€“80% (

Although the inclusion of adaptation may be considered an advantage over excluding it because it accounts for likely autonomous and planned adaptation, it is important that the modeling methods are justified robustly with reference to empirical evidence. An arbitrary assumption that populations might adapt by 100% (
