<p class="p">A variety of different statistical methods have been used to model adaptation. Six main methods can be employed (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In all but one study, where three of the methods were applied in the Netherlands (
 <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynen and Martens 2015</xref>), the six methods have been applied independently and have never been compared quantitatively, although an interesting discussion of the methods is presented by Kinney et al. (
 <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). Our study is distinct from all previous work because we compare all six methods across multiple European cities and because we consider multiple assumptions in the magnitudes of potential adaptation systematically for each method. We describe the six methods here and discuss their strengths and limitations.
