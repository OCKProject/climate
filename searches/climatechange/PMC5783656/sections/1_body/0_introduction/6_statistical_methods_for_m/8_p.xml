<p class="p">A caveat that runs through all the methods employed in previous work is that they are not supported with reference to specific empirical evidence that confirms the magnitudes of adaptation assumed. The only exception is that the relative threshold shift method has been justified with reference to the observation that threshold temperatures can generally be estimated using the 80–th percentile of the daily maximum temperature in multiple locations in Japan (

A novel opportunity exists to develop adaptation modeling methods based upon empirical evidence of historical adaptation because a growing body of evidence shows that in some cities and countries, populations are becoming less sensitive to extremes of heat (

The mechanisms associated with and driving this decline are a matter of debate, but it is clear from these studies that population sensitivity to heat can and does vary over time. Therefore, it is somewhat surprising that there has been no significant advancement in the statistical methods used to model adaptation over the past decade; the methods used
