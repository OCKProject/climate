<p class="p">Two methods are based on shifting the threshold temperature of an epidemiological exposure–response function (ERF). Many different conceptualizations of threshold temperatures are presented in the literature, including minimum mortality temperatures, optimum temperatures, and other derivations related to statistical differences in relative risk between baseline and extreme conditions (see

 <xref rid="c42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petitti et al. 2016</xref>). Regardless of the specific statistical definition of the threshold, in general, the risks of heat-related mortality are lowest (or lower) at the threshold, whereas for temperatures higher than the threshold there is a proportionally higher risk (e.g.,
