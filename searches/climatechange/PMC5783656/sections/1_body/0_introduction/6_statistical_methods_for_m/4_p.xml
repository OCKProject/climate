<p class="p">The “relative threshold shift” method assumes “0% adaptation” when the threshold temperature in absolute terms (which is calculated originally as a percentile of the present-day daily temperature time series) is also used with the future time series. In contrast, “100% adaptation” is assumed when the threshold temperature for the future is at the same percentile value as that of the present day (the absolute value will therefore be higher in a warmer climate). The midpoint of the threshold temperatures between 0% and 100% adaptation is “50% adaptation.” Previous assessments have assumed 50% (
