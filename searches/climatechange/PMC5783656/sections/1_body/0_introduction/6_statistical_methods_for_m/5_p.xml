<p class="p">Temperature-mortality ERFs are typically described by linear or nonlinear slopes that start from a threshold temperature. Accordingly, the third adaptation modeling method reduces the slope of the ERF in the future. Huynen and Martens (
 <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) assumed a 10% reduction in linear slope using this method. This method is intuitive because it is plausible that populations may become less sensitive to high temperatures under climate change, which would manifest as a reduction in the slope of the ERF. However, Huynen and Martens (
 <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>) acknowledge that the 10% decline in slope that they applied is hypothetical, and they do not provide empirical evidence to support it. The method is straightforward to apply to a linear ERF but considerably more complicated for a nonlinear ERF.
