<p class="p">We found that on average across all 14 cities, the range of the difference (percent) in impacts between including and excluding adaptation, independent of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty, can be as low as 28% with one method (reduction in slope of the ERF) and up to 103% with another (relative threshold shift combined with a reduction in slope of the ERF). Furthermore, we have shown that in 13 of the 14 cities, the ranges in projected impacts due to adaptation uncertainty are larger than those associated with climate modeling and emissions uncertainty.</p>
