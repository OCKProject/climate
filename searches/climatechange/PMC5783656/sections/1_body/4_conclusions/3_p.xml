<p class="p">Therefore, we strongly encourage an advancement beyond the prevailing methodological approach adopted in most impact studies, which has traditionally focused on accounting for climate modeling and/or emissions uncertainties at the expense of ignoring adaptation (e.g.,

 <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hajat et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kingsley et al. 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al. 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vardoulakis et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al. 2014</xref>). This status quo has developed from an inherent assumption that the most important uncertainties to account for are climate modeling and emissions uncertainty because they have been shown to result in large ranges in impacts (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gosling et al. 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hajat et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al. 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zacharias et al. 2015</xref>). Our results stand in stark contrast.
