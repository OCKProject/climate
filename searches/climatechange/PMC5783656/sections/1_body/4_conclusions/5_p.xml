<p class="p">We treated adaptation in a purely statistical sense without consideration of the specific programs, strategies, and behavioral changes that are ultimately driving the adaptation assumptions we applied. More thorough and widespread evaluation of intervention measures will be paramount in closing this loop (
 <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Boeckmann and Rohn 2014</xref>). Therefore, in parallel to our recommendations for future research, we acknowledge that more evidence should be generated on the costs and effectiveness of the large array of adaptation mechanisms that underlie the modeling assumptions we applied here, from individual to technological to health system levels. This additional information will enable policy- and decision makers to focus on the most cost-effective interventions and will enable researchers to base their adaptation methods on more robust data.
