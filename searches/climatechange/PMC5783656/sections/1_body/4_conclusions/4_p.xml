<p class="p">Therefore, researchers should carefully consider how to model adaptation. We call for a move towards impact assessments that explicitly report the range in impacts from using multiple GCMs, emissions scenarios, and different adaptation assumptions to provide a more comprehensive assessment of uncertainty. This will in turn provide policy- and decision makers with a more holistic picture of potential climate change impacts. Ideally, this will help decision makers adopt the appropriate scale and combination of different investments and interventions required for effective adaptation to climate change.</p>
