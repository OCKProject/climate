<p class="p">Some studies have calculated the baseline mortality rate either from daily mortality excluding deaths attributable to temperature (

 <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al. 2014</xref>), meaning that the baseline mortality rate is representative of the mortality rate of the exposed population at the threshold temperature. Others have calculated the baseline mortality rate from the total number of deaths (

 <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwartz et al. 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vardoulakis et al. 2014</xref>), which means that it is representative of the whole exposed population year-round (i.e., at the threshold temperature and at temperatures above the threshold). We employed the last approach simply because it is more commonly adopted, but we acknowledge that it would be useful in future work to investigate quantitatively the effect of calculating the baseline mortality rate with different methods.
