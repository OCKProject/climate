<p class="p">The algorithm described by Muggeo (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) and used by Baccini et al. (
 <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) for the threshold temperature estimation can be unstable. This instability means that the linear relationship we used can be sensitive to the threshold. We did not investigate the sensitivity of our estimated impacts to the threshold because our goal was to demonstrate the sensitivity of impacts to adaptation methods. The drawback of this algorithm may be accounted for by using different starting points for each temperature and lag structure when running the algorithm (
