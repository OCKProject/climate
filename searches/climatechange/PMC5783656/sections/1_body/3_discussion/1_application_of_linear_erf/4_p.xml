 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baccini et al. 2011</xref>). We controlled for this in our experimental design by holding the baseline mortality rate constant between present and future periods, in line with others (e.g.,

Changing the baseline mortality rates between the future and the present would affect the projected absolute number of deaths because some future deaths would be attributable to changes in the baseline mortality rate, but it would not affect the mortality rates attributable to climate change (
