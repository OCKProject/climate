<p class="p">We used city-specific ERFs that described linear relationships between daily apparent temperature and mortality in the form of a slope. They were derived from a set of nonlinear curves developed from a flexible parametric approach presented by Baccini et al. (

 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2003</xref>) so that a linear slope above the threshold was used as an effect estimate for each city; these were used as the ERFs in our study. As others have noted (

 <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>). For a highly nonlinear curve, the strength of the temperature–mortality response might be higher further along the curve where its gradient is larger (i.e., at higher temperatures) than it might be closer to the threshold where the gradient is smaller. Baccini et al. (
 <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) started from the threshold temperature when computing their effect estimates, so if their curves were highly nonlinear, it would be fair to assume that we under-estimated the climate change effects of temperature on heat-related mortality. However, visual inspection of the curves presented by Baccini et al. (
 <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) suggests that the curves are broadly linear beyond the threshold temperatures. Therefore, we did not calculate climate change impacts with nonlinear ERFs.
