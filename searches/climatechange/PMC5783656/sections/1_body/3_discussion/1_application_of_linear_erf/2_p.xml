<p class="p">A goal of our study was to provide a point of reference to the sensitivity of climate change impacts to different adaptation modeling methods for researchers conducting climate change impact assessments for heat-related mortality. Considering that almost all previous assessments used linear ERFs derived from estimates of RR for an increase in temperature above a specific value (

 <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al. 2014</xref>), we also used linear ERFs because it is likely that future studies will do so as well. Thus, our conclusions should be readily interpretable by the community. This is another reason why we did not calculate impacts with nonlinear ERFs. In addition, the application of linear ERFs makes it straightforward to apply simple changes in slope and location to represent adaptation. The potential gains of using nonlinear associations would be outweighed by the increased complexity in implementing adaptation options.
