<p class="p">Our first objective was to compare the range in projected impacts that arises from using different adaptation modeling methods. All previous assessments of the impacts of climate change on heat-related mortality have modeled adaptation with only one method (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayhoe et al. 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Honda et al. 2014b</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jenkins et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knowlton et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zacharias et al. 2015</xref>), excluded it altogether (e.g., 
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baccini et al. 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hajat et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kingsley et al. 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peng et al. 2011</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vardoulakis et al. 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wu et al. 2014</xref>), or, in one case, provided a comparison of impacts using only a subset of the range of modeling methods available (
 <xref rid="c28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huynen and Martens 2015</xref>). Here, for the first time, we have used multiple adaptation modeling methods with different assumed magnitudes of adaptation, and we have shown that the ranges in projected impacts vary significantly according to the adaptation modeling method that is employed.
