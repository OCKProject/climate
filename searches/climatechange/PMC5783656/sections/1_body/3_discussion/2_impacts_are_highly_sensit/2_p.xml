 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). However, modeling adaptation with a different method (relative threshold shift with a reduction in ERF slope) suggests that there will be 2 (per 100,000) fewer deaths each year with climate change than in the present day. This magnitude of impact is only observed if this specific adaptation modeling method is applied. Such an effect does not occur with any of the other adaptation modeling methods, nor does it occur under a low-emissions (RCP2.6) scenario or when multiple GCMs are considered without adaptation, wherein the smallest effects climate change will have on heat-related mortality are an additional 17 and 31 annual heat-related deaths (per 100,000), respectively.
