 <xref rid="c60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zacharias et al. 2015</xref>) justify its application with reference to the observation that threshold temperatures can generally be estimated using the 80–85th percentile of daily maximum temperature in multiple locations in Japan (

 <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Honda et al. 2014b</xref>). However, relative thresholds can vary over time (
 <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Åström et al. 2016</xref>) and between countries (
 <xref rid="c12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gasparrini et al. 2015a</xref>), which leads to concerns about the rationale behind this method. The method has also been criticized as inappropriate for projecting climate change impacts because the relative threshold may not be a valid proxy for the absolute threshold in the future (
 <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Åström et al. 2016</xref>). In addition, referring to “100% adaptation” (
 <xref rid="c24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Honda et al. 2014a</xref>) is somewhat misleading because we have shown that climate change still causes an increase in heat-related mortality compared with the present day under this assumption. This is because the shape and the location of the future temperature distribution change, but a relative threshold shift of 100% does not entirely account for the change in shape. In light of these limitations, the method should be applied with caution, and relative threshold shifts of 100% should be carefully considered with respect to their plausibility.
