<p class="p">Our results confirm criticisms that impacts based on the analog ERF method may be biased if social, economic, and demographic characteristics related to mortality differ greatly between city pairs (
 <xref rid="c27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huang et al. 2011</xref>). Application of this method in our study did not always have the effect of reducing mortality relative to no adaptation (e.g., for Milan, Stockholm, Turin, Valencia, and Zurich). One reason for this result is that the method is sensitive to the “matching” of one city to another; some matches were better than others. Another reason is that the cities were matched based only upon their daily

Therefore, we recommend that future impact studies consider whether it is plausible to apply the analog ERF method when taking into account similarities and differences between the socioeconomic characteristics of the different locations under investigation.
