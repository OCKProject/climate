<p class="p">We assumed in our comparison that the methods employed in previous studies for particular locations could readily be transferred to different locations. Previous studies that have used these methods have also made this assumption. Apart from the analog ERF method, which we have shown may not be a plausible method for some locations, our results suggest no reason why the methods cannot be applied to locations that are different from where they have been used previously. However, as we have already noted, when using these methods for a new location, researchers should check the validity of the assumed magnitude of adaptation by exploring historical adaptation trends for that location. Although our recommendation is based upon an analysis of existing methods, we also encourage the development of new methods for modeling adaptation across large populations. These new methods might include shifts and declines in slope where the magnitudes vary seasonally or interannually to reflect the lead-in times that typify decreasing sensitivity to heat over the historical period (

 <xref rid="c45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Petkova et al. 2014b</xref>) because all of the methods we employed combine the two. In practical terms, it is likely that the two mechanisms will operate at different magnitudes, heterogeneously across locations, and at different spatial and temporal scales.
