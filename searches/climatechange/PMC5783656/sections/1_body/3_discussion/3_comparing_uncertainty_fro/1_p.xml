<p class="p">Our second objective was to compare the range in impacts arising from adaptation uncertainty to the ranges from climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. We found that adaptation modeling uncertainty results in large ranges of projected heat-related mortality impacts. In 13 of 14 cities, adaptation modeling uncertainty resulted in ranges larger than those caused by both climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. This occurred largely as a result of modeling adaptation with relative threshold shifts. When other methods were used, the ranges were still large but typically smaller than those from climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. Our results confirm those of other studies that have shown large differences in impacts between adaptation and no adaptation (e.g.,

 <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sheridan et al. 2012</xref>), but here, we have provided additional understanding by specifically showing that adaptation uncertainty can have a greater effect on heat-related mortality rates attributable to climate than climate modeling and emissions uncertainty.
