<p class="p">Previous studies have paired locations for the analog ERF method by comparing mean annual temperatures (
 <xref rid="c32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knowlton et al. 2007</xref>), mean summer temperatures (
 <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayhoe et al. 2004</xref>), or maximum summer temperatures (
 <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mills et al. 2014</xref>) between present-day and future time periods for multiple locations, but these approaches do not account for the whole statistical distribution of temperatures. This is a significant limitation because it is the extremes of temperature, as well as the mean, that are important for heat-related mortality.
