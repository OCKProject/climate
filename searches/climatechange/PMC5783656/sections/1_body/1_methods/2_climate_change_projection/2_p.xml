<p class="p">Each GCM was run under RCP8.5 (high emissions) and RCP2.6 (low emissions) because these are the highest and lowest emissions scenarios, respectively, commonly used in climate modeling that are available from the four RCP emissions scenarios (
 <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Riahi et al. 2011</xref>). By using the highest and lowest emissions scenarios, we were able to investigate the maximum extent to which emissions scenario choice contributes to the uncertainty in projected heat-related mortality impacts.
