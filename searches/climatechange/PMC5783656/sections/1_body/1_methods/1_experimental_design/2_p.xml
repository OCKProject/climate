<p class="p">We also estimated impacts with no adaptation using climate projections from five GCMs run under RCP8.5 to explore the effect of climate modeling uncertainty while controlling for adaptation and emissions uncertainty. Furthermore, we estimated impacts with HadGEM2-ES run under low (RCP2.6) and high (RCP8.5) emissions scenarios to explore the effect of emissions uncertainty while controlling for adaptation and climate modeling uncertainty. The experimental design is summarized in
