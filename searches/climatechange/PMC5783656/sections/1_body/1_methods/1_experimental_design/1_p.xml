 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) under the assumption that populations will not adapt in the future, that is, “no adaptation.” We then estimated the impacts using six different methods for modeling adaptation. In all cases, the impacts were estimated using climate projections from one GCM (HadGEM2-ES) that was run under a single emissions scenario [Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5] to control for the effects of climate modeling and emissions uncertainty. We chose RCP8.5 because it is the highest of the four RCP emissions scenarios commonly used in climate modeling (
