<p class="p">Loss of traditional knowledge was also observed in other tropical communities affected by natural disasters like typhoon (Acosta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2016</xref>). And any natural disaster leads to a panic situation that reduces the ability of the community to deal with the immediate emergency (Asuero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>). Ten disaster management committees would serve a pivotal role in disaster preparednessâ€™ and management during any natural calamity. Local knowledge on adaptation to natural disaster has also been taken into account so that the same can aid in emergency situations and not get lost with time and development.
