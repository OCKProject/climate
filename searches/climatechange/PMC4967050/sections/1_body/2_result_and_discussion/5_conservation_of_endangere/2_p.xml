<p class="p">Mangroves act as an effective carbon sink (Donato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011</xref>) and sequester highest amount of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (than any other non-mangrove forest types) which approximately amounts to 100 tons of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> per hectare (ha) and also stabilize the soil particles to control erosion (Harty 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">1997</xref>). Hence, this plantation program was aimed to scale down the ominous effect of climate change as well as to form a natural barrier against any disaster. Mangroves have the unique ability to stabilize the soil particles, thus able to control the erosion. So, in future these plants can be effective to reduce the erosion of embankments of these areas. The huge root system of the mangrove flora has the ability to slow the tidal wave energy, this feature also helps to reduce the erosion. Then, in long term Mangrove would protect the country from both ill effect of climate modification and also from erosion of land. Works of Chowdhury et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2016</xref>) highlights that the climate change/sea level raise was responsible for the exclusion of true mangrove varieties (Rhizophoraceae members and plants with prominent physiological/phenological/morphological adaptations to combat salt stress) with salt tolerant/invasive species in central parts of Indian Sundarbans between 2008 and 2013. So sea level raise and climate change have deleterious influence on the mangrove ecology and re-vegetating the naked/deforested mudflats were a small step taken through this climate change adaptation project to conserve the mangrove varieties as well as increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sequestration. And this plantation program was required to motivate the community members towards revegetating the deforested mud flats with mangrove plants and is an indispensable part of this project aimed at improving community level adaptation strategies to battle climate change issues in vulnerable tropical coasts.
