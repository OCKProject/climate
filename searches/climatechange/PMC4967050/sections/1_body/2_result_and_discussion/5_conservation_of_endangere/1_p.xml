<p class="p">Scattered mudflats of 87.07 ha were brought under mangrove plantation in between 2012 and 2013. Approximately 140,843 saplings were planted (Satjelia Island) out of which 96,531 saplings survived by the end of 2015. The selected species for plantations were in endangered category as per IUCN red data book i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">Brugeria gymonorrhiza</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Brugeria sexangula</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora mucranata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Avicenia</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Ceriops decandra</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Xylocarpus mekongenis</italic> (IUCN 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2014</xref>). 355 sacks (700 propagules/sack) of 
 <italic class="italic">Avicennia</italic> spp. progules collected by local population that floats out from the reserve mangrove patches during high tide, were scattered in the mudflats during the plantation period. These 
 <italic class="italic">Avicennia</italic> spp. that are tolerent to high salinity stress, have shown a profuse growth and a comparatively better survival rate (81.5 %) than the saplings (68.5 %). Previous works by Chowdhury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2016</xref>, have also indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">Avicennia marina</italic> can tolerate high salinity stress resulting due to the influx of salt water from sea during storm surges like AILA (2009). This trait makes one of the most suitable colonizers outcompeting the salt sensitive species, due to sea level raise and climate change. PCFC/SHG members were employed in this plantation process (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and given wages as per standard labor rates. Community members in supervision of the group members have taken part in this plantation program. The donor agencies funded the purchase of saplings and also the re-embursement of the labor rates charged by the plantation team.
