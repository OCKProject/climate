<p class="p">Mangrove species produce propagules that are relatively easy to collect and plant. Propagules are directly planted particularly for 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora</italic> spp., but for other mangroves, seedlings and saplings have grown to a height of 0.3–1.2 m beforehand at nursery. Replanting mangroves is a useful first step but to restore the ecosystem, to protect the embankments by process of soil consolidation. The process of plantation follows this order (1) clearing of 
 <italic class="italic">Porteresia</italic> sp. patch to plant new mangrove saplings, as it hinder the growth of other mangrove plants by covering the sediments by thick mat of fibrous root system and competing with saplings of other halophytic species for nutrients (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a), (2) saplings are transported in wooden boat/dinghies to plantation sites from the nursery (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b), (3) digging of pits/trenches for plantation of saplings (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c), (4) excavation of trenches for plantation of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhizophora</italic> spp that possess distinct stilt roots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d).
