<p class="p">Early communications on climate change is mostly limited to scientific findings and synthesis of reports (Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2010</xref>). But this information originating at the researchers/scientist/environmentalist’s end should percolate to the resident populations and properly dealt with the managers (Tribbia and Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2008</xref>). Closing the gap between science and practice is a pressing ordeal bridged by the managers who regulate this flow of information from source to users (Cash et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2003</xref>). Another constraint in communicating climate change is the less impetus given to the human behavioral components in policy formulation and more weightage are given to the scientific fact-findings and technological aspects. Unsustainable ‘quick–win’ mindset of the people is mostly responsible for resource exploitive and non-green practices (Spence and Pidgeon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2010</xref>). So educating the local population is the foremost duty of an environmental manager to communicate climate change issues. Environmental threats can be mitigated with the dynamic participation of the local community and this ‘bottom up’ (from lowest strata of society to the policy making officials) mode of management is the effective process to battle this world threatening climate problems and communicating solutions (Carvalho et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2012</xref>). Community based approaches (CBA) target participant empowerment and a structured mechanism to communicate ideas from bottom to top (Allen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2006</xref>). Researches show that CBA is socio-economically effective tool in forest conservation and give positive outcomes (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR700" class="xref">2013</xref>; Robert and Rebecca 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2006</xref>). Growth of these CBA’s in environmental problems is due to its cost–effectiveness and preference of donors to this ‘community component’ for easy penetrability of the information and ideas to the lowest strata of the society. Communication involves a large number of discrete processes like framing messages through pictures and articulation, through the tale of life experiences for presenting an issue or event (Chong and Druckman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2007</xref>; Spence and Pidgeon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus the participatory style of awareness campaigns is effective in imparting consciousness about negative impacts of climate change. Social learning has many benefits than individual communication. It results in increased in shared knowledge, trust between members and induce democratic decision-making power to community members (Biedenweg and Monroe 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>).
