<p class="p">The Ganga–Brahmaputra–Meghna delta has already been labelled as the ‘Extremely vulnerable’ zone in the terms of population displacement due to climate change and raising ocean levels by 2050 (Ericson et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2013</xref>). In an estimate it is argued that mangroves are disappearing at an alarming rate of 2 % per year which is higher than any other endangered ecosystems, like coral reefs or tropical rain forest, due to anthropogenic interventions like habitat modification for agriculture and aquaculture along with pollution problems (Dasgupta and Shaw 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2013</xref>; Chowdhury and Maiti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2016a</xref>). This austere amphibious terrain infested with malaria causing mosquito, snakes, crocodile, tigers and regularly battered by cyclones and storm, is populated by ostracized section of society (reserve castes). Social organization of the Indian part of Sundarbans is discussed in details in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. Low education levels, chronic health problems, excess labor migration, a low skill base, lack of access to official credit, low savings, under employment, high dependence on government and poor infrastructure (housing, roads, embankments, ponds, waterways, marketing, electricity and communication) are indicators of a poor livelihood asset base in the region. And this compels the inhabitants to engage in resource exploitive activities like poaching and deforestation.
