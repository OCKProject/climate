  <title class="title">Diagram of reference and heated plots, including wiring and conduit systems.</title>
  <p class="p">Each plot is 11 X 13.5 m
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>. Plots 1 and 2 are 
   <italic class="italic">reference</italic>, 3 and 4 are 
   <italic class="italic">warmed</italic>, and 5 and 6 are 
   <italic class="italic">warmed +FTC</italic>. EPDM synthetic rubber roofing membrane material was installed to 30 cm depth between the two types of warmed plots (i.e., between plots 3–4 and 5–6) to inhibit roots from growing into different treatments. The parallel gray lines inside plots represent heating cable and the black lines outside plots represent heating cable conduit. The junction boxes, located along the conduit, are represented by white boxes. The equipment shed (center box) houses the control equipment for the experiment.
