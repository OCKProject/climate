<p class="p">An increasing number of studies recognize the importance of evaluating changes in winter climate [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Previous studies have examined the effects of a smaller snowpack on the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems primarily through snowmelt induced by infrared lamps in short-statured ecosystems such as tundra and grasslands [

 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] or addition of water to mimic rain on snow events [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] in tall statured ecosystems such as forests. Many snow removal experiments in the field induce persistent soil freezing (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]), while fewer induce FTCs in soil (e.g., 20, 26]). The distinction between the two forms of soil freezing is important since many ecosystems that have historically experienced snow are likely to experience an increase in FTCs as air temperatures oscillate around the freezing point, rather than a longer duration of soil freezing, over the next 100 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Most experiments that purposefully induce soil FTCs are limited to laboratory experiments (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]) and/or create severe freeze/thaw conditions that may be more intense than ecosystems experience in reality [

 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. While some studies have mimicked soil FTCs in the field under realistic conditions, these have been limited to ecosystems dominated by short-statured grasses and/or shrub species (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]). To our knowledge no study has utilized a combination of snow-removal and buried heating cables to induce soil FTCs in a mature forest ecosystem and none have combined this experimental treatment with warming during the snow-free season to examine the interactive effects of climate change across seasons in a terrestrial ecosystem. The “across season” effects could be antagonistic, additive, or synergistic, which would not be apparent from examining one season alone.
