<p class="p">We buried a total of 4 km of resistance heating cables in the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> plots in July and August 2012. Cable installation required approximately 340 person hours over three weeks to complete. Soil heating cables were buried 10 cm deep in lines that are 20 cm apart, making a total of 56 lines of cable across each plot (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171928.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). We used a flat-blade, square-edge shovel to make a 10 cm vertical cut in the soil for each cable, then used drywall spatulas to open the soil and gently insert the cable by hand. The cable is buried at 10 cm depth except for where that depth was not reachable due to large roots or rocks, in which case the cable rests aboveground. Cables also go around tree trunks aboveground and then are buried again on the opposite side. We made similar lines of 10 cm deep cuts in the two 
 <italic class="italic">reference</italic> plots to create the same disturbance across all six plots. Past studies have shown that the disturbance associated with installation of heating cables does not affect soil temperature or biological processes such as soil respiration [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Due to these past results and the high cost of infrastructure required to implement the experimental treatments and measure response variables, we had only “disturbance controls”, known as 
 <italic class="italic">reference</italic> plots, in our study. We waited 15 months between the time of cable installation and turning on of experimental treatments to allow the soil microbes, roots and soils to equilibrate following the disturbance in all six plots.
