<p class="p">The experimental warming applied to the four heated plots during the snow-free season is intended to simulate an anticipated 5°C rise in air temperatures by the year 2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. At the onset of the snow-free season, defined here as the time at which all snow and soil frost had melted and the daily soil temperatures began a natural increase tracking air temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], we began soil warming in both the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> plots. This onset of snow-free season warming occurred on April 18, 2014 and April 21, 2015 in each treatment year. Once triggered, the heating cables were used to maintain soil temperatures at 5°C above 
 <italic class="italic">reference</italic> soil temperatures throughout the snow-free season and continue until the mean air temperatures are below 0°C for five consecutive days or December 1, whichever comes first, to avoid warming throughout the winter in the event of a low snow year. Warming cables were turned off at the end of the snow-free seasons on November 19, 2014 and December 1, 2015. The annual power consumption to maintain the experimental treatments and sensors in 2015 was 63,521 kWh.
