<p class="p">The effects of experimental treatment on snow-free season soil temperature, snow-free season soil moisture, and winter environmental variables were assessed by plot using linear mixed effects models with plot nested within year as the random effect (R nlme package V 3.1â€“124, [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons among treatments were calculated using Tukey's HSD tests (R multcomp package, [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]). Assumptions of normality and constant variance were assessed by visual inspection of residual plots and data were log transformed when necessary. All statistical analyses were conducted in R version 3.1.2 (R Core Team 2014). Unless otherwise noted, values presented are treatment means with standard error.
