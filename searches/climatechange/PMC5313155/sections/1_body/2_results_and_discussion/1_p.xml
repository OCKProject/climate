<p class="p">By employing a combination of buried heating cables and snow-removal, we achieved a 5°C increase in average soil temperatures in the snow-free season and four soil FTCs in each winter, both of which are consistent with projected changes in temperature for northeastern U.S. forests over the next century [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Because soil temperatures track air temperatures during the growing season, we feel confident using 5°C as the expected increase in soil temperatures over the next century, as projected for air temperature in a variety of climate model scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The snow-free season warming treatment led to increased mean soil temperatures in the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> treatments relative to the reference treatment by 4.9 ± 0.8°C in 2014 and 2015 at 10 cm depth (all 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171928.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Soil temperatures at 30 cm depth in the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> treatments relative to the reference plots were elevated by 4.9 ± 0.0°C in 2014 and 4.5 ± 0.2°C in 2015 at 30 cm (
 <italic class="italic">p =</italic> 0.02). Soil temperatures declined with depth across all treatments in the snow-free seasons of both 2014 and 2015 (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.023 in 2014 and &lt; 0.0001 in 2015). Mean winter soil temperatures in the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> plots were not different from the other plots (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05), but the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> plots had lower minimum soil temperatures, snow depth, and snow AUC, as well as deeper maximum soil frost depth, greater soil frost AUC and more soil FTCs than the other four plots (

 <italic class="italic">reference</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> plots (i.e., 12 cm) compared to the long term average (i.e., 6 cm) measured in multiple locations throughout Hubbard Brook is likely due to local spatial variation in soil freezing. The effects of induced freeze-thaw cycles on soil temperatures varied by depth and influenced soils to a depth of at least 30 cm, while soil temperatures in 
 <italic class="italic">reference</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">warmed</italic> plots remained relatively constant and near freezing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171928.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). These changes in winter dynamics illustrate that the experimental treatments at CCASE lead to increased variability in winter soil temperatures through induction of soil FTCs, without affecting mean temperatures. Together, the changes in winter conditions in the 
 <italic class="italic">warmed + FTC</italic> plots mimic projected changes in soil thermal regimes for the northeastern U.S. [
 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] more accurately than snow removal alone would. While other experiments have successfully induced realistic increases in winter temperature variability in small statured ecosystems such as grasslands using infrared lamps [

 <xref rid="pone.0171928.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], this study is the first that we are aware of to document a similar treatment in an intact tall statured forest ecosystem.
