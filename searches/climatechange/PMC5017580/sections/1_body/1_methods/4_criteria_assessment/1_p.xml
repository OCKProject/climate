<p class="p">Exposure and sensitivity to perturbations and stressors were defined as criteria to assess hammocks resilience and a set of indicators was identified to assess each criterion. A score from 1 to 3 was used to assess each indicator, where lower values represented less exposure or sensitivity. A total of 425 hammock polygons were delimited in the LPBR by analysing SPOT multispectral and panchromatic images, aerial photographs, and land use and vegetation maps. The indicators of both criteria were assessed for each of these polygons.</p>
