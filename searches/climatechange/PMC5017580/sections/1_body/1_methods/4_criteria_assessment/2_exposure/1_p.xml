<p class="p">Five indicators were used to assess exposure: Sea flooding due to SLR scenarios, coastal flooding, proximity to streams, hurricanes impact, and land cover change. The main underlying force in the first four indicators is the intrusion of saltwater due to SLR. Although tidal flooding could also be a stressor in the persistence of hammocks, it operates at fine temporal scales; in studies encompassing broader temporal scales, such as this, it is difficult to assess its effects. However, tidal flooding is an intrinsic risk factor in some of the indicators we defined to assess the exposure (e.g., hurricanes impact) and sensitivity (e.g., type of hammock) criteria.</p>
