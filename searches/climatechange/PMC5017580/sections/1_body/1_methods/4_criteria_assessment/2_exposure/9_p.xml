 <bold class="bold">Land cover change</bold>: Land cover change (LCC) due to human activities affects the persistence of native land cover. To assess this indicator, the differences in reflectance between forested and non-forested areas were discerned using four georeferenced and orthorectified cloud-free Landsat scenes at 30 m resolution (
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). A combination of unsupervised classification methods was used to digitally classify the pixels in all four Landsat images with the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (ISODATA) in Idrisi Selva 17.0 (Clark Labs, Worcester). Six thematic classes were distinguished, which represented the land cover types in the study area, excluding shadow and cloud cover. The land cover types were: (1) high and dense vegetation mainly of hammocks and mangroves, a class whose pixels were very green with the highest Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values characterized by the homogeneity of forest cover; (2) discontinuous secondary forest, a forested class with low-density vegetation whose mixed pixels are characterized by a variety of land cover types including hammocks, intervened vegetation, low mangroves, and secondary mixed forest with a relatively high NDVI value; (3) bushes and shrubs whose pixels have a low to medium NDVI values; (4) coastal dune scrub communities, cattail, grass, and brush whose pixels have a low NDVI; (5) bare soil or sparse vegetation and dry grass, and (6) water (

For example; in the 1979 image, NDVI class 1 values ranged from 0.74 to 0.97, and in the 1990 image from 0.41 to 0.95; thus, NDVI class 1 had different values depending on the image date ranging from 0.32 (in 2014) to 0.97 (in 1979;
