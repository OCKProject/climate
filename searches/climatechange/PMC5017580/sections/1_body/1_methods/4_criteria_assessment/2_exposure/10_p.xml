<p class="p">Pixels that could be clearly identified as belonging to one of the six classes were extracted from the image to reduce spectral variability across the remaining pixels. Reflectance values corresponding to dense vegetation and exposed areas such as salt flats and crops were used to create spectral signatures for classes. The remaining pixels were grouped into the mixed class containing mangroves, secondary vegetation, and small-scale subsistence agriculture. This process was applied to each Landsat scene. A GIS-based spatial tool was used to assign pixels to the most likely thematic class based on their location to discriminate among similar classes and to avoid classification errors in established classes. No field data were available, so secondary reference data were used to validate map accuracy; for example, the national vegetation maps were used to discriminate among different types of forest and the orthophotos helped in identifying the agricultural class.</p>
