 <bold class="bold">Proximity to streams</bold>: Sea flooding due to SLR may be facilitated with the presence and proximity to streams. Modelling the hydrodynamic flow of watercourses was difficult because of the lack of high precision data and logistical constrains to make accurate measurements at the LPBR. Therefore, based on discussions with specialists, three distance buffers from streams (0–100, &gt;100–500, &gt;500 m) were created. These buffers were intersected with the 425 hammock polygons layer in order to assign an unsupervised risk category to each polygon (from 0 to 3). Zero represented no intersection, (1) &gt;500 m from streams, (2) from &gt;100 to 500 m, and (3) within 100 m from streams. Again, when a polygon was intersected by more than one risk category, it obtained the category with the largest proportion of area.
