 <bold class="bold">Coastal flooding</bold>: This indicator was considered because of the intrinsic vulnerability to sea flooding of areas with sinks and next to the coast. Three risk categories were defined for this indicator based on the hydrologic conditioning, the sink identification layer from HydroSHEDS, and the DSM. With this data, the low-lying areas close to the coastline and the natural sinks or depressions were delimited obtaining three zones that represented different exposure scores to sea flooding due to SLR scenarios. The most exposed zone (score 3) was the lowest-lying area (-5 to 3 m ASL) characterized by jungle hammocks, located in the coastline (&lt;4 km from the coastline) and coastal lagoons [
