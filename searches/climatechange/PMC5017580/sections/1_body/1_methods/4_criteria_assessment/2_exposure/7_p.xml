 <bold class="bold">Hurricanes impact</bold>: Hurricanes are a disturbance factor that may potentially affect hammocks persistence due to storm surges and vegetation damage. Hurricanes in the Atlantic coast can cause storm surges of 5 m or more [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The intensity and frequency of Atlantic hurricanes have increased substantially in recent decades. Based on numerical models [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], these phenomena are likely to become more intense as surface temperature of tropical sea increases [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Assessing this indicator relied on previous information of hurricane occurrence in the region through the analysis of hurricane frequency and intensity, as well as its relationship with terrain. First, historical data of hurricane occurrence within a buffer of 200 km from the LPBR were downloaded from the NOAA website [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] in GIS format. A total of 990 hurricane tracks were retrieved over a period of 171 years (1842â€“2013). A buffer for each hurricane track was generated according to its category (Saffir-Simpson scale) and inland effect [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Based on its intensity (tropical depression [TD], tropical storm [TS], and hurricane [H] from 1 to 4), the width of the buffer was defined as: TD = 1.6 km, TS = 3.2 km, H1 = 6.4 km, H2 = 9.7 km, H3 = 12.9 km, and H4 = 16.1 km [
