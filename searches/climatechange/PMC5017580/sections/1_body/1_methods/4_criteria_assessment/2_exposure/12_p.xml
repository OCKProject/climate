<p class="p">Scores were assigned to each polygon according to the transition categories from 1 to 3, where 1 represented recovery (an increase in the NDVI value), 2 perturbation (a decrease in the NDVI value of one or two class levels), and 3 the loss of native vegetation (a decrease in the NDVI value of more than two class levels; 
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The polygons that showed no transition were also assigned a score of 1. The overall transition score per polygon was calculated by averaging the transition scores of its pixels.
