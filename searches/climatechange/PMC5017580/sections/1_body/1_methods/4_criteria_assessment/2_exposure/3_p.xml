<p class="p">A Digital Surface Model (DSM) was used to perform a series of GIS analyses to assess this indicator. The DSM was reclassified adjusting the outliers; then, elevation scores were assigned from 1 to 3, where 1 represented the values from &gt;0 to 1 m above sea level (ASL), 2 from &gt;1 to 2 m ASL, and 3 from &gt;2 to 3 m ASL. Elevation values &lt;0 m and &gt;3 m were masked. The 425 hammock polygons were overlaid on the reclassified DSM to estimate the proportion of flooded area of each polygon in each of the three SLR scenarios. The categories of flooding due to SLR were assigned to the polygons according to their proportion of flooded area: (1) from 0 to 30%, (2) from &gt;30 to 60%, and (3) &gt;60%.</p>
