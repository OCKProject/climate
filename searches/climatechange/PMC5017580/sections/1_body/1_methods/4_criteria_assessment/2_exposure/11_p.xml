<p class="p">Land conversion analyses were performed with the module Land Change Modeler available in Idrisi Selva [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. The software provides a rapid assessment of quantitative change by graphing gains and losses per category or it examines the contribution to changes experienced by a single land cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In these analyses a number of predictors were considered including slope, distance to settlements, distance to roads, and distance to agriculture to calibrate the model. Transitions smaller than 1 km
