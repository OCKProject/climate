<p class="p">The buffers and the hammock polygons layers were intersected, obtaining a total of 485 tracks that directly hit the LPBR. The number of times that each hammock polygon was intersected by a hurricane and its type was estimated. Each hammock polygon was assigned a value by adding the products of the number of hurricanes that hit it by their intensity. These values were then normalized from 1 to 3 in order to assign a hurricane risk category to each hammock polygon.</p>
