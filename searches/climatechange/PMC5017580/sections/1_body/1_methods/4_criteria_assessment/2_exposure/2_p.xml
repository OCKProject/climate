 <bold class="bold">Sea flooding due to SLR scenarios</bold>: Given the uncertainties on SLR projections due to climate change and based on the precautionary principle, this indicator was assessed using three SLR scenarios for the next 100 years. These scenarios were based on the estimations given in the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Report (AR4, AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) as well as other regional projections [
