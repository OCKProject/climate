 <bold class="bold">Patch size</bold>: Patch size is one of the most used metrics in landscape analyses [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] and size is known to be correlated with some measure of persistence or stability. The hammock polygons layer was used to classify hammocks by their size. Hammock patches ranged from 0.15 to 89.6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. It was assumed that larger patches were less sensitive to SLR; in contrast, smaller patches were relatively less likely to rebound from disturbances because they were more likely to be fragmented or destroyed after changes in hydrology, destruction of vegetation, or the establishment of opportunistic flora and fauna [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Three size categories were defined: The largest patches (&gt;5 to 89.6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) got the lowest value of sensitivity (1), the smallest patches (&gt;0.15 to 1.5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) got the highest value of sensitivity (3), and the remaining patches (&gt;1.5 to 5 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) got a medium value of sensitivity (2).
