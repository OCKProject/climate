 <bold class="bold">Type of hammock</bold>: Each type of hammock has a specific vulnerability to SLR. Three types of hammocks were identified and delimited using the orthophotos and the hammock polygons layer: basin hammocks, mixed hammocks, and fringe hammocks. Then the type of hammock was rated based on their intrinsic sensitivity to SLR, basin hammocks scored 1, mixed hammocks scored 2, and fringe hammocks scored 3.
