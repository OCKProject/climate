 <bold class="bold">Hammock canopy height</bold>: This indicator assumed that canopy height is a proxy of habitat quality and that habitat quality influences the vulnerability of hammocks to SLR. A calibrated high-resolution (30 m) DSM was used to measure forest canopy height [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The DSM and the hammock polygons layer were overlaid to assign a score to polygons based on their canopy height. Mangrove hammock forest scored 1. This type of forest has an average height of 15 m or more due to the high concentrations of nutrients, low salinity, and soil with a thick layer of organic matter. They are associated to spring waterholes. 
 <italic class="italic">Rizophora mangle</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Laguncularia racemosa</italic> are the dominant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Medium height mixed forest scored 2. Canopy height in this forest is between 3 and &lt;15 m. This category includes deciduous forest, floodplain forest, and lowland deciduous forest among others [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Finally, the dwarf mangrove forest scored 3, where canopy height is between 1.5 and &lt;3 m. This forest develops in nutrient limited sediments and high salinity. It is dominated by 
 <italic class="italic">Rizophora mangle</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Some hammock polygons were intersected by two canopy height categories, therefore the final score was based on the category which covered the largest proportion of the polygon.
