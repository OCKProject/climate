<p class="p">Basin hammocks are located behind the coastline, the tidal influence is indirect and lower compared to the fringe hammocks. This community can be monospecific or a mixed species forest of 
 <italic class="italic">Avicennia germinans</italic>, if salinity is high, and 
 <italic class="italic">Laguncularia racemosa</italic>, if salinity is relatively low [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. On the other hand, fringe hammocks are mainly located on the coastline and in coastal lagoons. This type of hammock is influenced by astronomical tides with semidiurnal trends with a maximum value of +0.49 m and a minimum of -0.72 m a.s.l. [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>], so they are flooded and dried practically every day. In addition, they are exposed to winds and waves of up to 0.5 m, which can increase to more than 2.0 m during storms [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The dominant species is 
 <italic class="italic">Rizophora mangle</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Some of the hammocks (mixed hammocks) could not be distinguished from basin and fringe hammocks; in this case, hammocks could be influenced both by winds and tides, but their impact is lower than in the fringe hammocks.
