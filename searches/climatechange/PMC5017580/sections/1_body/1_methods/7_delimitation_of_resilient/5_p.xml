<p class="p">This statistic generated a continuous variable of standardized intervals measuring the cold spots or very low resilient areas (-6.32 to -1.79 G
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>* score), low resilient areas (&gt;-1.79 to 0.33), moderate resilient areas (&gt;0.33 to 2.11), and high (&gt;2.11 to 6.19) and very high resilient areas (&gt;6.19 to 9.98), the hot spots of resilience. In this sense, G
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>* score close to zero shows no pattern (a random distribution), whereas a high G
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>* score shows a clustered structure and represents highly resilient areas.
