 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] was adapted to our study, specifically to emphasize exposure and sensitivity to perturbations and stressors, considering persistence as part of the concept of ecological resilience. A hierarchical model was developed to measure, analyse, and weight the main ecological indicators to assess exposure and sensitivity criteria. The interaction of these criteria generated an index of persistence that was used to determine the most resilient areas of the LPBR (
