<p class="p">In this study, a matrix is developed to assess hammocks resilience, based on measures and metrics of hammocks exposure and sensitivity to SLR due to climate change at different spatiotemporal scales. Exposure, sensitivity, and persistence are used to build a model that operationalize the resilience analysis, using a modified vulnerability framework of the RH model [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In the model, a resilient ecosystem has a low exposure and a low sensitivity to stressors, and thus experiences a high persistence. Exposure to stressors is therefore proportional to sensitivity and both are the inverse of persistence. This study uses an indicator-based approach to evaluate coastal vulnerability and to characterize aspects or the state of coastal ecosystems, such as drivers of change, pressure on the ecosystem, human impacts on the vegetation, exposure, sensitivity, and risk of flooding due to SLR [
