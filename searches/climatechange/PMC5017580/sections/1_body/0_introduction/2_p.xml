<p class="p">According to the Fifth National Communication of Mexico to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change of 2012, the sea surface temperature in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Mexican Pacific may rise between 1 and 2°C by 2020; and in general, the climate of Mexico will be between 2 and 4°C warmer around 2050 [

Hammocks are restricted to the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico, the Everglades in Florida, and the Ciénaga de Zapata in Cuba [

In 1999, this region was decreed a natural protected area (NPA), “Los Petenes Biosphere Reserve” (LPBR). LPBR is a long, narrow coastal strip covering an area of 2,829 km
