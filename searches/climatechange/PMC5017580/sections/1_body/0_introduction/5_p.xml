<p class="p">In this study, we use the vulnerability framework applied in the Risk Hazard (RH) model [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] to understand the impact of a particular hazard event, such as SLR, and the dose-response of the entity exposed (hammocks). The RH model was developed to make vulnerability analysis consistent with the concerns of sustainability and global environmental change science [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Quantitative applications of this model applied in environmental and climate impact assessments emphasize the importance of including exposure and sensitivity to perturbations and stressors in the analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This study uses persistence of hammocks in response to SLR to assess the ecological resilience of the system [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], that in turn is derived from the core idea that multiple stability domains and equilibria may exist within an ecological system [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Persistence represents a fundamental property of the stability concept that corresponds to whole ecosystems; therefore, it is a holistic and qualitative concept of resilience [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. As such, persistence of coastal ecosystems is determined by the ability of hammocks to cope totally or partially with SLR by growing vertically, migrating inland or expanding laterally [
