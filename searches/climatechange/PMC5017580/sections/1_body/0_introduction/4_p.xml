<p class="p">Four decades ago, Holling introduced the term resilience in the ecological literature to explain the non-linear dynamics observed in disturbed ecosystems, by focusing on the persistence of populations or communities at the ecosystem level [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. He defined ecological resilience as the amount of disturbance that an ecosystem can withstand without changing self-organized processes and structures [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Since then, multiple meanings of resilience have appeared in the literature, giving the concept a rich history, sometimes with a considerable stretch from its original meaning [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Some authors recognize two distinct and measurable components of response to disturbance: ‘Resistance’ as the ability to persist during the disturbance, and ‘recovery’ as the capacity to ‘bounce back’ following alleviation of the disturbance [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Both terms are merged within the concept of ‘ecological resilience’ [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Recognizing the dynamics of ecosystems, current resilience theories envision ecosystems as constantly changing. As a result, resilience is often evaluated in terms of the amount of change a given system can undergo and still remain within a set of natural or desirable states [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. In this study, the concept of ecological resilience is defined as the magnitude of disturbance that hammocks can absorb before changes of states or tolerances occur in response to perturbations [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. To make this concept practical and measurable, it needs to be applied to empirical cases, for which the dynamics of the ecosystem needs to be understood [
