<p class="p">This proposed methodological framework to assess resilience against climate change has proven to be efficient even when high-precision data are missing. Lack of data is a fairly common situation in many countries, such as Mexico, where high-precision eco-geographical data are still missing. Resilience analyses in highly vulnerable ecosystems, such as hammocks, are urgently needed because decisions have to be taken to implement the most appropriate adaptation or mitigation strategies, based on the best available information.</p>
