<p class="p">Criteria and indicators used in this research were assumed to be appropriate, even though coastal ecosystems may also be sensitive to other variables, such as the increase in sea surface temperature, ocean acidification, salt water intrusion, rising ground water tables, and changing runoff patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], among others. Hammocks persistence could also be affected by rainfall patterns, because precipitation and water seeping into the ground water table tend to dissolve the limestone surface (karst) causing the formation of sinkholes and thus, hammocks. Although it was not possible to assess the rate (not to mention the change in rate) of hammock formation because of changes in precipitation patterns due to climate change, this is a variable that remains to be analysed. The Mexican state of Campeche is located in one of the most vulnerable regions subjected to drought, and this tends to worsen [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. The assessment of precipitation averages projected to 100 years (1980–1999 to 2080–2099) in the Fourth Report on Climate Change of the IPCC [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] estimates a decrease in annual precipitation for the entire Central American region. Some studies have also estimated a decrease in annual precipitation in the Yucatán Peninsula from 10 to 15% and over 30% in the dry and rainy seasons respectively [

 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] also estimated a decrease between 10 to 22% in annual precipitation by 2090, with periods of drought that could even reach a reduction of 48%. This decrease in rainfall could cause more intense droughts and more frequent forest fires [
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], which would further threaten hammocks resilience.
