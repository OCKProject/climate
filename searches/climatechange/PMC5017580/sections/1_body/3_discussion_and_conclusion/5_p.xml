<p class="p">This research shows that approximately 25% of the LPBR is highly or very highly resilient to SLR, particularly in areas that are distant from the coast and are only indirectly influenced by tides, have a dense forest cover, and a low probability of hurricane incidence. On the other hand, hammocks with low or very low resilience cover 51% of the LPBR and are characterized by its location near the coastline, are covered with sparse vegetation, and are directly exposed to winds and tides. These results suggest that half of the LPBR is vulnerable to SLR due to climate change.</p>
