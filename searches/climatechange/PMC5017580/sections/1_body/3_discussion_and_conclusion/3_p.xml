<p class="p">Proximity to coastline is just one of the several factors that affects hammocks resilience. For example, coastal areas in the LPBR are structured by an array of parallel stripes to the coastline due to the presence of fringe mangrove that grows in salt water and where beaches are not present. This suggests a low physical energy from the environment, allowing mangroves to trap sediments and litter [
