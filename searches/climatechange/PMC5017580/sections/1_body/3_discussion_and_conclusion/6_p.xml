<p class="p">Although the LPBR is a natural protected area, it does not necessarily grant its conservation. The rate of LCC in some areas is high, particularly in those areas with dense and high vegetation outside the core areas of the LPBR. LCC due to human activities could significantly hamper the potential of inland hammock migration due to SLR as salt water intrudes the coastline.</p>
