<p class="p">A resilience index was developed based on qualitative and quantitative data to assess the magnitude of estimated future SLR disturbances on a coastal ecosystem due to climate change. This type of studies allows a better design of response strategies to face SLR disturbances on sensitive ecosystems, such as hammocks. While a comprehensive resilience analysis would ideally consider the entire ecosystem, this is unrealistic. Nevertheless, every pattern observed in an ecosystem is the result of several functional and evolutionary processes that are simplified or idealized with models [
