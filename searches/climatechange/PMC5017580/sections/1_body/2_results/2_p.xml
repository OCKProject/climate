<p class="p">The assessment of the sensitivity criterion showed that the highest proportion of the LPBR corresponded to the moderate risk category for the indicators “hammock canopy height” (94.6% scored 2, 4.8% scored 1, 0.6% scored 3) and “type of hammock” (46.7% scored 2, 44.1% scored 3, 9.2% scored 1). On the other hand, a higher proportion (49.4%) corresponded to the highest risk category (score 3) of the “patch size” indicator, followed by the low (41.9%, score 1), and moderate (8.7%, score 2) categories. The interpolation of the sensitivity indicators showed that 8.0% of the study area presented very low sensitivity, 39.5% low, 15.5% moderate, 17.2% high, and 19.8 very high (Figs
