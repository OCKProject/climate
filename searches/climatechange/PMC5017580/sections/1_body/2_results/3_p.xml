<p class="p">Resilient areas at the LPBR were defined from the interpolation of the estimated persistence value of each hammock polygon. About 65 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (6.4%) of the LPBR was very highly resilient to SLR due to climate change, and 194 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (19.1%) was highly resilient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162637.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). These areas were characterized by being distant from the coastal zone, little direct tidal influence, and consisted of hammocks surrounded by basin mangrove and floodplain forest. These areas also had a low influence of streams and channels, and a low probability of hurricane occurrence. These areas were located in the north-eastern and eastern portions of the LPBR. On the other hand, hammocks with very low resilience covered an area of 172 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (16.9%) and hammocks with low resilience an area of 346 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (34.0%). These hammocks were located in coastal areas without vegetation or with scattered mangroves, and with a direct influence of tides and winds. These areas were located in the north-western and southern portions of the LPBR. Areas with medium resilience had dense and high vegetation, they had a very low sensitivity, and high levels of exposure mainly because of a high rate of LCC.
