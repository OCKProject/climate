<p class="p">The assessment of the exposure criterion showed that most of the LPBR has a low risk for the indicators “sea flooding due to SLR scenarios” (95.1% scored 1, 2.8% scored 2, 2.1% scored 3) and “LCC” (47.6% scored 1, 26.8% scored 2, 25.6% scored 3). On the other hand, a large proportion of the LPBR corresponded to the moderate risk category for the indicators “coastal flooding” (63.1% scored 2, 27.5% scored 1, 9.4% scored 3) and “hurricanes impact” (53.0% scored 2, 46.5% scored 1, 0.4% scored 3). Finally, for the indicator “proximity to streams” 38.5% of the LPBR corresponded to the high risk category (score 3), while 25.1% scored 2, and 36.3% scored 1. Based on the interpolation of the exposure indicators, 17.3% of the study area presented very low risk, 24.2% low, 37.5% moderate, 14.3% high and 6.7% very high (Figs
