<p class="p">The assessment of the three other weighting schemes (
 <xref rid="pone.0162637.t007" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 7</xref>) showed that high resilient areas had a coincidence of 73.9% with scheme 1, 64.3% with scheme 2, and 72.4% with scheme 3. Since indicators to assess exposure and sensitivity can be quite diverse and that the weighting values assessed gave consistent resilience estimates, these analyses were considered appropriate in accordance with the opinions of experts, published research, and data availability.
