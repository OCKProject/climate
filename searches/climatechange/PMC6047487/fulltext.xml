Physiological plasticity has the potential to buffer organisms from warming by reducing the thermal sensitivity of life-sustaining processes and increasing physiological tolerances (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>). Behavioral avoidance can also buffer organisms from climate change by minimizing exposure to costly or lethal temperatures (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>). However, the potential for plasticity to buffer species from extinction is contentious. Climate warming might exceed plastic capacities (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>) or increase costs of behavioral strategies (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). Predictions that incorporate plasticity might help to resolve whether physiological and behavioral responses can reduce extinction risk.</p><p>The absence of plasticity represents a major impediment to improving predictions of extinction risk under climate change (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). The most common approach used to predict extinction risk under warming cannot explicitly incorporate plasticity because their predictions are generated using statistical relationships between species occurrence data and climatic data (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). These correlative models operate under the assumption that occurrence data implicitly reflect underlying mechanisms, such as phenotypic plasticity. Alternatively, mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) are well suited to explore the ecological consequences of plasticity (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). These models estimate habitat suitability by linking functional traits with the biophysical environment to determine whether organisms can acquire the necessary energy for survival and reproduction, that is, the fundamental niche (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). To date, studies have yet to link both physiological and behavioral plasticity to an individual&#x02019;s capacity to acquire sufficient energy to survive and reproduce. Current evidence suggests that mechanistic and statistical SDMs predict similar responses to climate (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>), but the incorporation of plasticity might disrupt the similarities between mechanistic and correlative predictions.</p><p>Mechanistic SDMs predict the distribution of habitat suitability through space and time by assessing energy balance. Daily and seasonal fluctuations in the thermal and hydric environment jeopardize energy balance by reducing the rates and durations of activities that supply energy and resources (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). Temperature constrains energy intake in plants and animals by reducing the rates of photosynthesis and the capacity to forage and assimilate energy, respectively (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Similarly, the vapor content of the air also influences habitat suitability by limiting the duration of foraging activity and increasing lethal dehydration stress (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Climate change might further exacerbate hydric stress as warming increases the drying power of the air. Physical expectations indicate that warming will increase evaporation rates by increasing the vapor pressure deficit (VPD), one of the primary forces driving evaporation rates (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). High VPDs are known to threaten plants as a major driver of mortality events (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>), and the rise in evaporation rates under climate change increases exposure to lethal dehydration events by fourfold in birds (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). Therefore, ecological predictions require knowledge on the physiological and behavioral strategies that organisms use to minimize thermal and hydric stress.</p><p>Amphibians are among the most vulnerable organisms on the planet (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>), yet they exhibit a high degree of physiological plasticity (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr"><italic>21</italic></xref>). The empirical evidence of plasticity in amphibians consists primarily of thermal tolerances and timing of metamorphosis, but we lack a rigorous test of plasticity in traits related directly to balancing energy budgets, a key component of the fundamental niche. To address this gap in our knowledge, we evaluated the potential for plasticity in metabolic rates, water loss rates, and behavior to reduce extinction risk for seven species within the <italic>Plethodon jordani</italic> species complex under climate warming, assuming that carbon emissions continue to rise at current levels [Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)] (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). We estimated extinction risk for the entire species complex because these species can exhibit the greatest biomass among salamanders across the region (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>), and they have a wide geographic distribution within the global hotspot of salamander diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). As high elevation specialists, these species also share similar climatic requirements reflecting underlying physiological similarities (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that populations of these species have recently declined (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>), exhibited reductions in body size due to climate (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>), and face a widespread loss of suitable habitat under future climate warming (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>). Because of their shared physiological requirements, high abundance, and high extinction risk, these species are well suited to assess the role of plasticity in minimizing the loss of biodiversity.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Acclimatization of physiological traits in the global hotspot of salamander diversity.</title><p>The species richness of the salamander diversity hotspot (<xref rid="R60" ref-type="bibr"><italic>60</italic></xref>) inset on top of the eastern United States with the geographic range of the <italic>P. jordani</italic> species complex outlined in black (<bold>A</bold>).

Both laboratory-based experiments and field-based experiments relied upon using a flow-through respirometry system. We collected individuals (<italic>n</italic> = 180 for field study and <italic>n</italic> = 120 for laboratory study) along elevational gradients for both experiments in a stratified design. We collected along the elevational gradient due to recent evidence of greater physiological plasticity in salamanders collected from low elevations potentially indicative of local adaptation (<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr"><italic>28</italic></xref>).</p><p>In the field and laboratory, salamanders adjusted physiological traits in ways that would maximize time available to forage and minimize energetic costs.

We also found that <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> was positively correlated to VPDs [<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.702; slope (&#x003b2;) = 11.1; slope (SE) = 4.19]. Individuals acclimatized by lowering metabolic rates by 24.7% during the warmest part of the year (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). Metabolic rates were also negatively correlated with our measurements of air temperature (<italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = 0.53; &#x003b2; = &#x02212;5.22; SE = 2.81).

In the laboratory, individuals maintained high <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> or increased <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> by as much as 68% in response to controlled exposure to the experimental conditions (fig.

The magnitude and consistent pattern of acclimatization in the field and laboratory suggest a high potential for <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> to minimize the ecological impact of rising VPDs. We combined these responses with validated estimates of air temperature and VPD to predict extinction under climate warming.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Environmental predictions appear valid</title><p>Relevant estimates of temperature and VPD are critical to predict energy balance using mechanistic SDMs. We estimated air temperatures and VPDs experienced by salamanders on the basis of the microclim data set, which estimates relevant microhabitat conditions for many organisms (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>). We increased the spatial resolution using adiabatic lapse rates to capture the changes in air temperature that occur due to altitude, and we estimated VPDs based on the local dew point temperature on an average night (see Materials and Methods and the Supplementary Materials for calculations). We validated our estimates of temperature and VPD with direct measurements of near-surface conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 2939) from the field using temperature and humidity data loggers. Our predicted values of current temperatures and VPDs overlapped with the observed values from the field with the exception of 2 months that were warmer than we predicted (fig. S2). We predicted VPDs under future climate warming based on the typical pattern of constant relative humidities during climate change in global circulation models (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Under climate change, we predicted VPDs to rise by 29.5% by the end of this century across the hotspot of salamander diversity (fig. S3), which is consistent with ~3% rise per decade predicted by general circulation models (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>). The spatial distribution of VPDs suggests that high elevations will continue to contain the most suitable habitat by 2100 (fig. S3). Persistence of salamander populations in these areas depends upon whether the degree of climate change challenges their capacity to balance their energy budget.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plasticity improves performance of the SDM</title><p>We integrated physiological acclimatization and avoidance behavior into a simulation-based SDM to predict extinction risk across the global hotspot of salamander diversity. The model predicts annual energy balance, activity, and local extirpation of a site by integrating across an average day for each month of the year. We integrated physiological acclimatization into our predictions based on the consistent upper limits of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> (7 s/cm) recorded in our laboratory and field-based experiments. We compared these estimates with an average <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> (4 s/cm) to identify the maximum potential for physiological acclimatization to reduce extinction risk. We also incorporated behavioral avoidance into our SDM because these species are well known for their behavioral avoidance of harsh climatic conditions. In nature, terrestrial salamanders assess climatic conditions at the opening of their refuge and avoid unfavorable thermal and hydric conditions (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). We incorporated behavioral avoidance based on the relative energetic costs associated with activity. In the simulations with avoidance behavior, individuals either foraged on the surface or remained inactive underground depending upon the state with the lowest net energetic costs. Salamanders always abandoned surface activity upon reaching a specific dehydration threshold, a relative amount of mass lost due to water loss during activity (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). We predicted annual energy balance under all possible combinations of body size, dehydration thresholds for activity, physiological acclimatization, and behavioral strategies every 10 years over the next century for a total of 480 simulations across 288,000 sites. With these iterations, we could address the sensitivity of our predictions to ecologically important factors.</p><p>Incorporating physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance improved our ability to explain the current geographic range of the species complex. Without acclimatization and avoidance, our simulation indicated that 63% of the current geographic range could not support salamanders (that is, annual energy reserves were depleted). With acclimatization and avoidance, more than 90% of their species range was predicted to be suitable (that is, positive energy balance), assuming that individuals remained active until losing 10% of their body mass to water loss, a realistic value based on empirical evidence (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). Including behavioral avoidance improved our SDM by predicting most of their geographic range to support the energetic demands of reproduction (at least 1.7 kJ/year) (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). The SDM overestimated the species range at higher latitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>), but mechanistic SDMs typically overestimate species ranges to regions that are inhabited by congenerics with similar physiological traits (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>). The importance of acclimatization and avoidance under current climates suggests that these responses could be important during climate warming.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Acclimatization and avoidance behavior reduces extinction risk in the core of salamander diversity hotspot.</title><p>Estimates of energy balance (ranging from green to red) and extinction (grayscale) as warming progresses through time (top to bottom) demonstrate that acclimatization and avoidance behavior reverse extinction in the core of the global hotspot of salamander diversity.

Without plasticity, 71% of the sites within the species range were predicted to experience local extirpation by the end of the century. With plasticity, our SDM predicted that only 20% of the sites within the species&#x02019; range would experience local extirpation by 2100 for an average-sized salamander (~3 g for our study) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figs. 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, plasticity reduced the number of sites expected to experience local extirpation by 72% by the end of the century. The SDM also predicted that the geographic range would contract by 30% by the end of the century with physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Populations that persisted through the next century appear to be limited to high elevations in the core of their range (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref> for digital elevation map underlying energy balance). The incorporation of plasticity led to an increase in positive energy balance in the core of their range by as much as twofold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). Therefore, including plasticity reversed the pattern of energy balance over the next century in the core of their range. Warming still appears to negatively affect populations at the range limits as energetic costs exceed energy intake (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>), whereas warming positively affects the core of their range by increasing energy intake. We also discovered that local extirpation occurred because of a failure to balance energy budgets, and salamanders never experienced physiological death because of reaching their maximum thermal tolerance.</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Extinction risk is highest for juvenile salamanders.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The effects of acclimatization and avoidance behavior are illustrated using empty circles (no acclimatization or avoidance behavior), half-filled circles (acclimatization only), and full circles (acclimatization and avoidance behavior).

These differences in body size explained up to 53% of the variation in the number of areas predicted to become locally extirpated within the species range during climate change (table S3). Thus, juveniles or small-bodied terrestrial salamanders might experience the greatest threat to their capacity to forage, defend territories, and find mates in the future. However, we identified three possible responses capable of relieving physiological stress of juveniles.

Recent meta-analyses have suggested that climate change will exceed the physiological capacities of ectotherms to tolerate warming (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). In contrast, other studies have suggested that plasticity will buffer species from climate change (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>), but to date, studies have yet to link plasticity in multiple traits to an individual&#x02019;s capacity to balance their energy budget. Our results indicate that predictions without explicitly incorporating plasticity should be interpreted cautiously. Our study also demonstrates that the incorporation of physiological and behavioral plasticity can improve the capacity of mechanistic SDMs to explain the geographic range of a species. By incorporating complex traits, mechanistic SDMs might identify the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that support the fundamental niche. We also predicted that warming might disproportionately threaten small individuals and juveniles, a common trend among many taxa under climate change (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>).</p><p>Reductions in body size represent a universal response to climate warming due to an increase in energetic costs that reduce energy available for growth (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). In our analysis, the higher rates of physiological death in small individuals suggest that studies on salamanders have missed critical processes underlying ecological responses to climate by focusing on an average body size (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). For instance, warming has been linked to reductions in body size of salamander populations by reducing the amount of energy available for growth (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Our study reveals that large individuals exhibit a substantial advantage under warming in terms of energy balance and activity budgets, likely due to their low surface area&#x02013;to&#x02013;volume ratios, higher energy intake, and greater lipid reserves that minimize the risk of starvation. Our analysis is consistent with reductions in energy available for growth, resulting in reductions in body size; however, the reductions in body size might also reflect changes in the age distribution of a population or statistical artifacts due to nonrandom sampling (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). If these alternative explanations are true, the survival of small individuals would rely upon adaptation, plasticity, or greater behavioral avoidance.</p><p>We identified three possibilities that could greatly reduce physiological stress of juveniles. These responses could ameliorate physiological stress imposed upon juveniles, but the possibility of one of these scenarios reducing extinction risk appears low, at least in isolation. For instance, we lack evidence that <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> is a heritable trait or that the required genetic variation exists for <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> to evolve. We also assumed that salamanders had immediate access to prey, and thus, the capacity to maximize energy intake will depend upon prey densities. Any reductions in prey abundances would inhibit their capacity to maximize energy intake. The analysis also indicated that a 20% reduction in metabolic rates could lower extinction risk for juveniles, and our experimental results suggest that salamanders can meet that demand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). However, our simulations required that juveniles reduce metabolic rates by 20% during the entire year, whereas our empirical results indicated that salamanders only acclimatize during the warmest period of the summer. In isolation, these scenarios seem unlikely, but they are not mutually exclusive. Combinations of these responses might interact over time to lower physiological stress. In addition, juveniles might avoid lethal stress by restricting activity to saturated microhabitat, such as under leaf litter. These unexplored strategies might be critical for lowering physiological stress in the most vulnerable stage of life.</p><p>Our results suggest that correlative SDMs overestimate extinction risk because they do not capture plasticity. Comparisons between correlative and mechanistic SDMs indicate that these approaches can produce similar predictions under climate warming (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). In our focal system, correlative SDMs have predicted suitable habitat for the global hotspot of salamander diversity to disappear under climate change (<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr"><italic>27</italic></xref>), a result that is similar to our simulations without plasticity. However, incorporating plasticity fundamentally altered our predictions of extinction by maintaining habitat suitability and reversing the change in energy balance during warming in the core of their range. Our analysis suggests that correlative models struggle to capture complex traits, such as phenotypic plasticity. More precisely, correlative models can predict whether populations will experience nonanalogous climates under climatic change (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>), but they cannot evaluate whether an individual has the potential to survive and reproduce in nonanalogous climates. Correlative models are likely more appropriate for studies on current distributions, such as the discovery of unknown populations (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>) or factors beyond physiology, such as species interactions, that structure species ranges (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). However, spatial layers derived from physiology can be incorporated into a correlative framework, and previous work indicates that incorporating mechanism can reduce the severity of extinction risk under climate change (<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). These findings bolster our claim that mechanism promotes a more flexible, and possibly realistic, perspective on the impact of climate warming, particularly if the model addresses uncertainty (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>). Studies like these can inform conservation strategies by providing perspective on the processes that threaten biodiversity.</p><p>Conservation plans can improve their effectiveness by considering the physiological mechanisms that contribute to population decline (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>). For amphibians, enigmatic population declines have hindered the development of effective conservation strategies (<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Understanding the cause of amphibian declines has been complicated by the multitude of factors that contribute to their decline, such as habitat conversion, overexploitation, disease, and climatic factors (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr"><italic>44</italic></xref>). Salamanders are no exception. Population declines in North and South America have occurred in the absence of a clear cause (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr"><italic>45</italic></xref>). Here, we contributed to the broader effort of identifying the geographic regions with the highest physiological stress under climate warming. These predictions can be combined with alternative stressors across a landscape (for example, disease risk and habitat destruction) to identify high-priority regions for conservation action. Because of additional threats like novel fungal pathogens (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr"><italic>46</italic></xref>), an integrative approach provides the best chance to conserve the global hotspot of salamander diversity.</p><p>Physiological and behavioral plasticity have been proposed as predictors of a species&#x02019; susceptibility to climate change (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr"><italic>47</italic></xref>). In accordance with this hypothesis, we discovered that physiological and behavioral plasticity reduced estimates of extinction risk under the most extreme warming scenario. We acknowledge that interpreting plasticity can be complicated by an incomplete understanding of the relative costs and benefits of plasticity. Physiological acclimation in lungless salamanders has been shown to reflect a trade-off between water loss rates and metabolic rates due to underlying physical and biochemical linkages (<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr"><italic>48</italic></xref>). The trade-off has the potential to undermine the benefits of acclimation, but in our study, salamanders in the field-based experiments appeared to decouple physiological responses to thermal and hydric stressors without exhibiting an obvious trade-off. We also suggest further studies on the consequences of physiological acclimatization for behavior will improve our understanding of the costs and benefits of plasticity. Even with these caveats, our results underscore the need to include complex biological responses, such as plasticity and adaptation, into ecological predictions of climate change. These considerations will improve our capacity to understand whether physiological and behavioral plasticity can effectively meet the biophysical demand of climate change.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animal collection and care</title><p>Our study conducted several laboratory-based experiments to confirm that individuals exhibit physiological plasticity in response to temperature and humidity. We collected <italic>P. metcalfi</italic> from the Nantahala National Forest near Cullowhee, NC (35&#x000b0;20&#x02032;N, 83&#x000b0;4&#x02032;W) for all experiments. We collected no more than four individuals from random coordinates that we generated using QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System Developmental Team), and we sampled more than 100 m from the road to reduce the risk of road effects. We collected individuals equally across the extent of our species&#x02019; elevational range at low (1000 m), mid (1300 m), and high (1600 m) sites. After collection, we placed each salamander in a Ziploc bag with moist leaf litter and transported them back to the laboratory. Individuals were maintained in containers (17 cm &#x000d7; 17 cm &#x000d7; 12 cm) throughout their time in the laboratory and provided with moist paper towels to avoid dehydration. All experiments were approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee at Clemson University (#2014-024), and approval for collections and experimentation were granted by the Nantahala National Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (#MA90761B-0), and the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission (#16-SC00746).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Seasonal acclimatization of physiology</title><p>Seasonal variation in physiological traits could identify the sensitivity of organisms to environmental cues. We collected 36 individuals at five time points (<italic>n</italic> = 180) that occurred over the spring, summer, and fall of 2015 to measure variation in physiological traits. After collection, salamanders were maintained at 15&#x000b0;C for 1 week to ensure that salamanders were in a postabsorptive state. Waiting for 1 week did not appear to influence our ability to detect geographic variation of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> in the past, and an acclimation period was critical to control for potential differences in digestion. We then used the flow-through system (described in the Supplementary Materials) to measure physiological traits. Each salamander was measured three times over a period of 2.5 hours at 18&#x000b0;C and a VPD of 0.5 kPa (76% relative humidity). We only analyzed physiological traits during rest, which occurred at least 1 hour after being placed in the chambers, and we excluded any measurements with spikes or irregularities indicative of activity. The values of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> and <inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> were calculated using a series of equations that convert partial pressures of gases into meaningful physiological values (see eqs. S1 to S4). Resistance of the respiratory system could be ignored because these species lacked lungs and relied upon cutaneous gas exchange to breathe. We included an additional laboratory-based experiment that tested the extremes of their capacity to acclimatize (described in the Supplementary Materials) to demonstrate that salamanders in this population exhibited physiological plasticity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Environmental data</title><p>We measured temperature and humidity in the spring, summer, and fall of 2015 to identify the relationship between physiological plasticity and environmental cues. We distributed 15 iButton data loggers (Hygrochron, Maxim Integrated) to randomly generated coordinates at the collection sites. The local microhabitat associated with each iButton typically consisted of low-lying herbaceous undergrowth in a hardwood, deciduous forest. We programmed the iButtons using Thermodata Viewer (v. 3.1.24; Thermodata Ltd.) to record temperature and relative humidity every 20 min from May to September 2015. We only included nighttime temperatures and humidities in our analyses (<italic>n</italic> = 2939). The iButtons were placed on the ground in hardwire mesh cages (1-cm gauge) and measured conditions at ~1 cm above the forest floor. We then converted relative humidity to VPDs using the equations described in the Supplementary Materials. We averaged the nightly temperatures and VPDs over the 10 days before collection. We selected 10 days due to the rate at which congenerics adjust physiological traits to temperature in the laboratory (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr"><italic>49</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Estimation and validation of environmental data for SDM</title><p>We used estimates of air temperature near the surface from the microclim data set (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>), which generates estimates of surface temperature across the globe under various types of microclimatic environments. For our model, we assumed that the environmental temperatures were similar to the surface soil temperatures (depth, 0 cm) in 90% shade to reflect the conditions of a typical deciduous forest. We used an adiabatic correction on the temperature layers from the microclim data set that accounts for the effect of altitude on temperature to improve the resolution to ~0.9 km<sup>2</sup> (see eq. S5). We estimated the vapor content of the air by treating the daily minimum temperature as the dew point temperature (see eq. S6) because minimum temperatures frequently approach the dew point temperature due to radiative cooling near the surface (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr"><italic>50</italic></xref>). To estimate VPDs under climate change, we assumed that relative humidities remained constant during climate change, a typical characteristic of general circulation models (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). We validated the estimates of temperature and humidity using the iButton data loggers deployed from March to October in 2015 and 2016 using the same methods described above. We then assessed the relationship between observed and predicted estimates of surface temperature and VPDs. The microclim values were then used to estimate activity and energetics in our foraging-energetic SDM.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Foraging-energetic SDM</title><p>We developed a physiologically structured SDM to estimate the change in durations of activity and net energy balance under climate change over the geographic range of the <italic>P. jordani</italic> species complex. The model was built from a custom code implemented in Python (v. 2.7) that iterated across each pixel (<italic>n</italic> = 288,000) of the environmental data to calculate activity and energetics. We validated our physiologically structured approach in a recent study by demonstrating the necessity of accurate estimates of resistance to water loss to predict the current distribution of the study species (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr"><italic>51</italic></xref>). Our modeling approach predicted 83% of the recorded captures between 1940 and the current day to be in positive energy balance. We provided a flow chart that describes how the model iterates through space, time, and phenotypes to generate estimates of activity, energy budgets, and extinction risk (fig. S4).</p><p>In our model, individuals need to acquire sufficient energy (that is, prey) while foraging to reproduce and maintain their physiological capacity to survive. We limited the potential for activity to nighttime hours (2100 to 0600) to reflect their nocturnal behavior. We then used durations of activity to calculate energy budgets based on thermally sensitive traits involving energy intake and costs. Body temperatures were estimated using humid operative temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>eh</sub>) to account for radiative balance at night and the loss of heat associated with evaporative cooling (see eq. S10) (<xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr"><italic>52</italic></xref>). Salamanders were active when body temperatures were between 5&#x000b0; and 25&#x000b0;C because <italic>Plethodon</italic> cease activity outside of this range, and this interval represented the range of values that salamanders selected in the laboratory (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). A salamander could be active until the salamanders lost 10% of their fully hydrated mass, the threshold at which motor function begins to decline (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>). We also ran simulations with a 3.5 and 7% dehydration threshold to assess the sensitivity of the output to the dehydration threshold. Upon losing the specified body mass to water loss, salamanders retreated underground (to 2.5- or 30-cm depth, depending on the behavioral strategy) to rehydrate during the day. Our assumption that salamanders rehydrate during the day was supported by the maintenance of high water potential of soil in the southern Appalachian Mountains (<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr"><italic>53</italic></xref>) and the rapid rehydration rates of <italic>Plethodon</italic> in soil (<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr"><italic>54</italic></xref>).</p><p>A key component to foraging-energetic models is the balance between energetic intake and costs. We estimated energy intake while foraging based on the thermal sensitivity of prey consumption (in joules) and energy assimilation (see eq. S11) (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><italic>55</italic></xref>). In our simulations, individuals always have access to prey during activity, and they immediately consume and digest their prey. Water intake from prey was incorporated by assuming that insects had an average composition of water content of ~70% and yielded 22 kJ/g of dry mass (<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr"><italic>56</italic></xref>). Energetic costs were estimated from the variation in resting rates of oxygen consumption (<inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub>) across temperature measured in the laboratory in this study (see eq. S12). Rates of <inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> during activity were estimated to be 1.5-fold higher than resting rates (<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr"><italic>57</italic></xref>), and salamanders were assumed to exhibit resting rates of <inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> when underground. Reproductive potential was determined by whether an individual could acquire sufficient energetic resources (1.7 kJ) over a year to support their biennial strategy of reproduction (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). While inactive underground, a salamander&#x02019;s body temperature was calculated on the basis of the soil temperature fluctuations that occur throughout the day at a given depth (see eq. S13). We assumed that salamanders could find a suitable microhabitat during brumation (winter dormancy) throughout the cold months. Energetic costs associated with brumation are less than 1% of their total energy reserves (<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr"><italic>58</italic></xref>); therefore, we assumed no energetic costs associated with subzero temperatures. Because of the difficulty in estimating energy budgets, our model required several assumptions. However, we believed these assumptions to be supported by existing data or result in conservative estimates of extinction. These assumptions and explanations can be found in the Supplementary Materials.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Incorporation of physiological and behavioral plasticity</title><p>We ran multiple simulations of the model with and without acclimatization of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub>. The values of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> were empirically derived estimates based on the seasonal variation of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> that coincided with changes in VPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and plasticity of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> in the laboratory (fig. S3). We modeled physiological plasticity using changes in the mean value of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> between simulations. By using the mean, our simulations estimated the full potential for physiological plasticity to minimize the effect of warming. Simulations with acclimatization incorporated the maximum value of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> (7 s/cm), and simulations without acclimatization incorporated the average value of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> (4 s/cm). We also tested the extent to which behavioral avoidance buffers extinction risk. In simulations with avoidance, salamanders retreated underground to a depth of 30 cm when net energetic costs were higher while foraging relative to remaining inactive underground. This avoidance behavior was used to simulate the potential for individuals to limit exposure to high energetic costs. We selected a depth of 30 cm in simulations with avoidance due to the negligible dampening of temperature beyond this depth. Therefore, this depth represents the maximum depth that behavioral strategies might minimize energetic costs. We used a depth of 2.5 cm in simulations without avoidance to identify the full potential of avoidance to minimize energetic costs. These depths also represented the range of depths that terrestrial salamanders behaviorally selected while underground (<xref rid="R59" ref-type="bibr"><italic>59</italic></xref>). Comparisons between these depths indicated the greatest extent to which behavioral choices of depth might influence energy balance and extinction.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Predicting extinction</title><p>We estimated extinction based on the net energy balance of salamanders and temperatures that they experienced throughout the year. We considered a population at a site to be locally extirpated if body temperature exceeded the critical thermal maximum of 34.9&#x000b0;C while inactive underground (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). From an energetic perspective, populations at a certain geographic location were considered extinct if net energy budgets fell below the lipid reserves for a given body size (see eq. S14). The model assessed energy balance throughout the year (as opposed to the annual net energy balance) to determine whether the climatic conditions depleted energy reserves during any month of the year. Our analysis addresses sensitivity of extinction by adjusting body size, <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub>, dehydration thresholds, and behavioral strategies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Plasticity or adaptation required to lower extinction</title><p>We ran additional simulations that varied <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub>, <inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub>, and energy assimilation based on empirical evidence to identify the phenotypic changes required for individuals with a small body size (2 g) to avoid extinction. Specifically, we tested whether extreme trait variation in <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> due to developmental plasticity or adaptation could reverse estimates of extinction. We tested <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> from 8 to 15 s/cm, which represents trait values above the current distribution of <italic>r</italic><sub>i</sub> phenotypes. We also explored the capacity for acclimatization of <inline-formula>V&#x0202f;.&#x0202f;</inline-formula>O<sub>2</sub> to lower extinction risk, and we ran simulations in which individuals reduced metabolic costs from 10 to 50%. We also increased energy intake based on the upper bound of an SD of energy assimilation (<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr"><italic>55</italic></xref>). Maximizing energy assimilation adjusted energy intake by 22 to 122% depending on body temperature. We determined the phenotypic changes required to maintain habitat suitability by comparing the average energy balance within the species range from current time periods to energy balance by the end of the century with the extreme trait variation.</p></sec></sec>
