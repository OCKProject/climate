  <title class="title">Acclimatization and avoidance behavior reduces extinction risk in the core of salamander diversity hotspot.</title>
  <p class="p">Estimates of energy balance (ranging from green to red) and extinction (grayscale) as warming progresses through time (top to bottom) demonstrate that acclimatization and avoidance behavior reverse extinction in the core of the global hotspot of salamander diversity. Green regions are predicted to have sufficient energy for reproduction, orange regions are in negative energy balance, and grayscale regions are extinct. The grayscale also indicates the elevation ranging from black (80 m) to white (2300 m). The left panels do not include acclimatization, the middle panels include acclimatization, and the right panels include acclimatization and avoidance behavior. The black outline represents the range limits for the 
   <italic class="italic">P. jordani</italic> species complex. The maps have a spatial resolution of 1 km
   <sup class="sup">2</sup> over an area of 430 km Ã— 530 km.
