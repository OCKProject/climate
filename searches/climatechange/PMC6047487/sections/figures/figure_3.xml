   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) The effects of acclimatization and avoidance behavior are illustrated using empty circles (no acclimatization or avoidance behavior), half-filled circles (acclimatization only), and full circles (acclimatization and avoidance behavior). Each panel illustrates how warming influences extinction risk within the geographic range for each body size (2 to 5 g) over the next century. Average proportions of extinct regions with SDs of four body size classes are shown. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold> to 
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) The spatial distribution of energy balance and extinction for each corresponding body size (2 to 5 g) reveals that juvenile salamanders are disproportionately affected by warming.
