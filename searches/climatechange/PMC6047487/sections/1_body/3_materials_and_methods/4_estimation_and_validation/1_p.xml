<p class="p">We used estimates of air temperature near the surface from the microclim data set (
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>), which generates estimates of surface temperature across the globe under various types of microclimatic environments. For our model, we assumed that the environmental temperatures were similar to the surface soil temperatures (depth, 0 cm) in 90% shade to reflect the conditions of a typical deciduous forest. We used an adiabatic correction on the temperature layers from the microclim data set that accounts for the effect of altitude on temperature to improve the resolution to ~0.9 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (see eq. S5). We estimated the vapor content of the air by treating the daily minimum temperature as the dew point temperature (see eq. S6) because minimum temperatures frequently approach the dew point temperature due to radiative cooling near the surface (

 </xref>). To estimate VPDs under climate change, we assumed that relative humidities remained constant during climate change, a typical characteristic of general circulation models (

 </xref>). We validated the estimates of temperature and humidity using the iButton data loggers deployed from March to October in 2015 and 2016 using the same methods described above. We then assessed the relationship between observed and predicted estimates of surface temperature and VPDs. The microclim values were then used to estimate activity and energetics in our foraging-energetic SDM.
