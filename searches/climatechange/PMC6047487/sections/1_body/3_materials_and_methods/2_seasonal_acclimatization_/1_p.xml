<p class="p">Seasonal variation in physiological traits could identify the sensitivity of organisms to environmental cues. We collected 36 individuals at five time points (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 180) that occurred over the spring, summer, and fall of 2015 to measure variation in physiological traits. After collection, salamanders were maintained at 15°C for 1 week to ensure that salamanders were in a postabsorptive state. Waiting for 1 week did not appear to influence our ability to detect geographic variation of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> in the past, and an acclimation period was critical to control for potential differences in digestion. We then used the flow-through system (described in the Supplementary Materials) to measure physiological traits. Each salamander was measured three times over a period of 2.5 hours at 18°C and a VPD of 0.5 kPa (76% relative humidity). We only analyzed physiological traits during rest, which occurred at least 1 hour after being placed in the chambers, and we excluded any measurements with spikes or irregularities indicative of activity. The values of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> and 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> were calculated using a series of equations that convert partial pressures of gases into meaningful physiological values (see eqs. S1 to S4). Resistance of the respiratory system could be ignored because these species lacked lungs and relied upon cutaneous gas exchange to breathe. We included an additional laboratory-based experiment that tested the extremes of their capacity to acclimatize (described in the Supplementary Materials) to demonstrate that salamanders in this population exhibited physiological plasticity.
