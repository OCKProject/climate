<p class="p">Our study conducted several laboratory-based experiments to confirm that individuals exhibit physiological plasticity in response to temperature and humidity. We collected 
 <italic class="italic">P. metcalfi</italic> from the Nantahala National Forest near Cullowhee, NC (35°20′N, 83°4′W) for all experiments. We collected no more than four individuals from random coordinates that we generated using QGIS (Quantum Geographic Information System Developmental Team), and we sampled more than 100 m from the road to reduce the risk of road effects. We collected individuals equally across the extent of our species’ elevational range at low (1000 m), mid (1300 m), and high (1600 m) sites. After collection, we placed each salamander in a Ziploc bag with moist leaf litter and transported them back to the laboratory. Individuals were maintained in containers (17 cm × 17 cm × 12 cm) throughout their time in the laboratory and provided with moist paper towels to avoid dehydration. All experiments were approved by the Institute for Animal Care and Use Committee at Clemson University (#2014-024), and approval for collections and experimentation were granted by the Nantahala National Forest, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (#MA90761B-0), and the North Carolina Wildlife Resource Commission (#16-SC00746).
