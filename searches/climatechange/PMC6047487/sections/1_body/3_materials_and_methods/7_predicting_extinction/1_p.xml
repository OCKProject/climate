<p class="p">We estimated extinction based on the net energy balance of salamanders and temperatures that they experienced throughout the year. We considered a population at a site to be locally extirpated if body temperature exceeded the critical thermal maximum of 34.9Â°C while inactive underground (

 </xref>). From an energetic perspective, populations at a certain geographic location were considered extinct if net energy budgets fell below the lipid reserves for a given body size (see eq. S14). The model assessed energy balance throughout the year (as opposed to the annual net energy balance) to determine whether the climatic conditions depleted energy reserves during any month of the year. Our analysis addresses sensitivity of extinction by adjusting body size,
