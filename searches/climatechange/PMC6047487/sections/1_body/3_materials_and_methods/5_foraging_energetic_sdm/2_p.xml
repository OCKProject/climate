<p class="p">In our model, individuals need to acquire sufficient energy (that is, prey) while foraging to reproduce and maintain their physiological capacity to survive. We limited the potential for activity to nighttime hours (2100 to 0600) to reflect their nocturnal behavior. We then used durations of activity to calculate energy budgets based on thermally sensitive traits involving energy intake and costs. Body temperatures were estimated using humid operative temperature (

 <sub class="sub">eh</sub>) to account for radiative balance at night and the loss of heat associated with evaporative cooling (see eq. S10) (

 <italic class="italic">Plethodon</italic> cease activity outside of this range, and this interval represented the range of values that salamanders selected in the laboratory (

 </xref>). A salamander could be active until the salamanders lost 10% of their fully hydrated mass, the threshold at which motor function begins to decline (

 </xref>). We also ran simulations with a 3.5 and 7% dehydration threshold to assess the sensitivity of the output to the dehydration threshold. Upon losing the specified body mass to water loss, salamanders retreated underground (to 2.5- or 30-cm depth, depending on the behavioral strategy) to rehydrate during the day. Our assumption that salamanders rehydrate during the day was supported by the maintenance of high water potential of soil in the southern Appalachian Mountains (
