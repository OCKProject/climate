<p class="p">A key component to foraging-energetic models is the balance between energetic intake and costs. We estimated energy intake while foraging based on the thermal sensitivity of prey consumption (in joules) and energy assimilation (see eq. S11) (

  <italic class="italic">55</italic>
 </xref>). In our simulations, individuals always have access to prey during activity, and they immediately consume and digest their prey. Water intake from prey was incorporated by assuming that insects had an average composition of water content of ~70% and yielded 22 kJ/g of dry mass (

 </xref>). Energetic costs were estimated from the variation in resting rates of oxygen consumption (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) across temperature measured in the laboratory in this study (see eq. S12). Rates of 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> during activity were estimated to be 1.5-fold higher than resting rates (
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">57</italic>
 </xref>), and salamanders were assumed to exhibit resting rates of 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> when underground. Reproductive potential was determined by whether an individual could acquire sufficient energetic resources (1.7 kJ) over a year to support their biennial strategy of reproduction (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). While inactive underground, a salamander’s body temperature was calculated on the basis of the soil temperature fluctuations that occur throughout the day at a given depth (see eq. S13). We assumed that salamanders could find a suitable microhabitat during brumation (winter dormancy) throughout the cold months. Energetic costs associated with brumation are less than 1% of their total energy reserves (
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">58</italic>
 </xref>); therefore, we assumed no energetic costs associated with subzero temperatures. Because of the difficulty in estimating energy budgets, our model required several assumptions. However, we believed these assumptions to be supported by existing data or result in conservative estimates of extinction. These assumptions and explanations can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
