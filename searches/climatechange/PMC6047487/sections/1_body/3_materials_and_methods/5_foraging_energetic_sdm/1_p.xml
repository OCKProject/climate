<p class="p">We developed a physiologically structured SDM to estimate the change in durations of activity and net energy balance under climate change over the geographic range of the 
 <italic class="italic">P. jordani</italic> species complex. The model was built from a custom code implemented in Python (v. 2.7) that iterated across each pixel (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 288,000) of the environmental data to calculate activity and energetics. We validated our physiologically structured approach in a recent study by demonstrating the necessity of accurate estimates of resistance to water loss to predict the current distribution of the study species (
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">51</italic>
 </xref>). Our modeling approach predicted 83% of the recorded captures between 1940 and the current day to be in positive energy balance. We provided a flow chart that describes how the model iterates through space, time, and phenotypes to generate estimates of activity, energy budgets, and extinction risk (fig. S4).
