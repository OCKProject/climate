<p class="p">We measured temperature and humidity in the spring, summer, and fall of 2015 to identify the relationship between physiological plasticity and environmental cues. We distributed 15 iButton data loggers (Hygrochron, Maxim Integrated) to randomly generated coordinates at the collection sites. The local microhabitat associated with each iButton typically consisted of low-lying herbaceous undergrowth in a hardwood, deciduous forest. We programmed the iButtons using Thermodata Viewer (v. 3.1.24; Thermodata Ltd.) to record temperature and relative humidity every 20 min from May to September 2015. We only included nighttime temperatures and humidities in our analyses (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2939). The iButtons were placed on the ground in hardwire mesh cages (1-cm gauge) and measured conditions at ~1 cm above the forest floor. We then converted relative humidity to VPDs using the equations described in the Supplementary Materials. We averaged the nightly temperatures and VPDs over the 10 days before collection. We selected 10 days due to the rate at which congenerics adjust physiological traits to temperature in the laboratory (
