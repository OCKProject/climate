 <sub class="sub">i</sub> due to developmental plasticity or adaptation could reverse estimates of extinction. We tested

 <sub class="sub">i</sub> from 8 to 15 s/cm, which represents trait values above the current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> phenotypes. We also explored the capacity for acclimatization of 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to lower extinction risk, and we ran simulations in which individuals reduced metabolic costs from 10 to 50%. We also increased energy intake based on the upper bound of an SD of energy assimilation (
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">55</italic>
 </xref>). Maximizing energy assimilation adjusted energy intake by 22 to 122% depending on body temperature. We determined the phenotypic changes required to maintain habitat suitability by comparing the average energy balance within the species range from current time periods to energy balance by the end of the century with the extreme trait variation.
