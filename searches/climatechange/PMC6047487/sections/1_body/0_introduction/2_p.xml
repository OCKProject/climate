<p class="p">The absence of plasticity represents a major impediment to improving predictions of extinction risk under climate change (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">9</italic>
 </xref>). The most common approach used to predict extinction risk under warming cannot explicitly incorporate plasticity because their predictions are generated using statistical relationships between species occurrence data and climatic data (
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </xref>). These correlative models operate under the assumption that occurrence data implicitly reflect underlying mechanisms, such as phenotypic plasticity. Alternatively, mechanistic species distribution models (SDMs) are well suited to explore the ecological consequences of plasticity (

  <italic class="italic">10</italic>
 </xref>). These models estimate habitat suitability by linking functional traits with the biophysical environment to determine whether organisms can acquire the necessary energy for survival and reproduction, that is, the fundamental niche (

  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>). To date, studies have yet to link both physiological and behavioral plasticity to an individualâ€™s capacity to acquire sufficient energy to survive and reproduce. Current evidence suggests that mechanistic and statistical SDMs predict similar responses to climate (
