<p class="p">Amphibians are among the most vulnerable organisms on the planet (
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">20</italic>
 </xref>), yet they exhibit a high degree of physiological plasticity (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">7</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">21</italic>
 </xref>). The empirical evidence of plasticity in amphibians consists primarily of thermal tolerances and timing of metamorphosis, but we lack a rigorous test of plasticity in traits related directly to balancing energy budgets, a key component of the fundamental niche. To address this gap in our knowledge, we evaluated the potential for plasticity in metabolic rates, water loss rates, and behavior to reduce extinction risk for seven species within the 
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon jordani</italic> species complex under climate warming, assuming that carbon emissions continue to rise at current levels [Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5)] (
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). We estimated extinction risk for the entire species complex because these species can exhibit the greatest biomass among salamanders across the region (
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">23</italic>
 </xref>), and they have a wide geographic distribution within the global hotspot of salamander diversity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). As high elevation specialists, these species also share similar climatic requirements reflecting underlying physiological similarities (
 <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">24</italic>
 </xref>). Moreover, recent evidence suggests that populations of these species have recently declined (
 <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>), exhibited reductions in body size due to climate (
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">26</italic>
 </xref>), and face a widespread loss of suitable habitat under future climate warming (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>). Because of their shared physiological requirements, high abundance, and high extinction risk, these species are well suited to assess the role of plasticity in minimizing the loss of biodiversity.
