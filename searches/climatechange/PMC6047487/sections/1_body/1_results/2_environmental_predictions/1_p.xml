<p class="p">Relevant estimates of temperature and VPD are critical to predict energy balance using mechanistic SDMs. We estimated air temperatures and VPDs experienced by salamanders on the basis of the microclim data set, which estimates relevant microhabitat conditions for many organisms (

 </xref>). We increased the spatial resolution using adiabatic lapse rates to capture the changes in air temperature that occur due to altitude, and we estimated VPDs based on the local dew point temperature on an average night (see Materials and Methods and the Supplementary Materials for calculations). We validated our estimates of temperature and VPD with direct measurements of near-surface conditions (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2939) from the field using temperature and humidity data loggers. Our predicted values of current temperatures and VPDs overlapped with the observed values from the field with the exception of 2 months that were warmer than we predicted (fig. S2). We predicted VPDs under future climate warming based on the typical pattern of constant relative humidities during climate change in global circulation models (

  <italic class="italic">22</italic>
 </xref>). Under climate change, we predicted VPDs to rise by 29.5% by the end of this century across the hotspot of salamander diversity (fig. S3), which is consistent with ~3% rise per decade predicted by general circulation models (
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">16</italic>
 </xref>). The spatial distribution of VPDs suggests that high elevations will continue to contain the most suitable habitat by 2100 (fig. S3). Persistence of salamander populations in these areas depends upon whether the degree of climate change challenges their capacity to balance their energy budget.
