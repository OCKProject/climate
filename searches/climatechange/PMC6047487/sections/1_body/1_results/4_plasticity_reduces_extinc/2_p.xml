<p class="p">Juveniles might experience the greatest physiological stress as the climate warms. In our predictions, large individuals (5 g) experienced little risk of extinction over the next century, whereas small individuals experienced the greatest threat to their physiological capacity to survive (

These differences in body size explained up to 53% of the variation in the number of areas predicted to become locally extirpated within the species range during climate change (table S3). Thus, juveniles or small-bodied terrestrial salamanders might experience the greatest threat to their capacity to forage, defend territories, and find mates in the future. However, we identified three possible responses capable of relieving physiological stress of juveniles. Our additional sensitivity analysis on small individuals indicated that evolving a high
