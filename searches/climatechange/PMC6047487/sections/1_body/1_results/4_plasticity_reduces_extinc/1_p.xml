<p class="p">Physiological and behavioral plasticity maintained energy balance in the core of the hotspot of salamander diversity under climate warming. Without plasticity, 71% of the sites within the species range were predicted to experience local extirpation by the end of the century. With plasticity, our SDM predicted that only 20% of the sites within the speciesâ€™ range would experience local extirpation by 2100 for an average-sized salamander (~3 g for our study) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Thus, plasticity reduced the number of sites expected to experience local extirpation by 72% by the end of the century. The SDM also predicted that the geographic range would contract by 30% by the end of the century with physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> for digital elevation map underlying energy balance). The incorporation of plasticity led to an increase in positive energy balance in the core of their range by as much as twofold (

 </xref>), whereas warming positively affects the core of their range by increasing energy intake. We also discovered that local extirpation occurred because of a failure to balance energy budgets, and salamanders never experienced physiological death because of reaching their maximum thermal tolerance.
