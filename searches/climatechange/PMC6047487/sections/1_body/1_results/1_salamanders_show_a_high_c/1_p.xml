<p class="p">We determined the capacity of an abundant, widely distributed salamander (
 <italic class="italic">Plethodon metcalfi</italic>) to acclimatize by adjusting metabolic rates [volume of oxygen consumption (
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>)] and water loss rates [skin resistance to water loss (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub>)] in response to seasonal changes in climate in field-based experiments and under controlled exposure to temperatures and humidities in laboratory. Both laboratory-based experiments and field-based experiments relied upon using a flow-through respirometry system. We collected individuals (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 180 for field study and 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 120 for laboratory study) along elevational gradients for both experiments in a stratified design. We collected along the elevational gradient due to recent evidence of greater physiological plasticity in salamanders collected from low elevations potentially indicative of local adaptation (
