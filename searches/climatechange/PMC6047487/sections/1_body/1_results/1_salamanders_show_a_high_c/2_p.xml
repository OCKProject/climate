<p class="p">In the field and laboratory, salamanders adjusted physiological traits in ways that would maximize time available to forage and minimize energetic costs. In the field, we assessed the effect of body size, elevation, and sampling time period of measurements on 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> and 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. We also demonstrated that these physiological traits are correlated with either temperature or VPD. The field-based experiments revealed that individuals increased 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> by 35% in response to VPDs with the greatest drying potential (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), and nearly 20% of the variation of 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> was explained by the sampling time period (table S1). We also found that 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> was positively correlated to VPDs [
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.702; slope (β) = 11.1; slope (SE) = 4.19]. Individuals acclimatized by lowering metabolic rates by 24.7% during the warmest part of the year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Metabolic rates were also negatively correlated with our measurements of air temperature (

 <sup class="sup">
  <italic class="italic">2</italic>
 </sup> = 0.53; β = −5.22; SE = 2.81). Sampling time period explained less than 5% of the variation in metabolic rate (table S2), indicating a high degree of variation in acclimatization of 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">V . </inline-formula>O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. In the laboratory, individuals maintained high 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> or increased 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> by as much as 68% in response to controlled exposure to the experimental conditions (fig. S1). Individuals across the elevational gradient exhibited the same capacity to acclimatize (that is, no signal of local adaptation). The magnitude and consistent pattern of acclimatization in the field and laboratory suggest a high potential for 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> to minimize the ecological impact of rising VPDs. We combined these responses with validated estimates of air temperature and VPD to predict extinction under climate warming.
