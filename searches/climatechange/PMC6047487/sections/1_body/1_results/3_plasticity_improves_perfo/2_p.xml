<p class="p">Incorporating physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance improved our ability to explain the current geographic range of the species complex. Without acclimatization and avoidance, our simulation indicated that 63% of the current geographic range could not support salamanders (that is, annual energy reserves were depleted). With acclimatization and avoidance, more than 90% of their species range was predicted to be suitable (that is, positive energy balance), assuming that individuals remained active until losing 10% of their body mass to water loss, a realistic value based on empirical evidence (
