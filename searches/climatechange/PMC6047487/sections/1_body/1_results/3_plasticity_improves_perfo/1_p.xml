<p class="p">We integrated physiological acclimatization and avoidance behavior into a simulation-based SDM to predict extinction risk across the global hotspot of salamander diversity. The model predicts annual energy balance, activity, and local extirpation of a site by integrating across an average day for each month of the year. We integrated physiological acclimatization into our predictions based on the consistent upper limits of

 <sub class="sub">i</sub> (7 s/cm) recorded in our laboratory and field-based experiments. We compared these estimates with an average

 <sub class="sub">i</sub> (4 s/cm) to identify the maximum potential for physiological acclimatization to reduce extinction risk. We also incorporated behavioral avoidance into our SDM because these species are well known for their behavioral avoidance of harsh climatic conditions. In nature, terrestrial salamanders assess climatic conditions at the opening of their refuge and avoid unfavorable thermal and hydric conditions (

 </xref>). We incorporated behavioral avoidance based on the relative energetic costs associated with activity. In the simulations with avoidance behavior, individuals either foraged on the surface or remained inactive underground depending upon the state with the lowest net energetic costs. Salamanders always abandoned surface activity upon reaching a specific dehydration threshold, a relative amount of mass lost due to water loss during activity (

 </xref>). We predicted annual energy balance under all possible combinations of body size, dehydration thresholds for activity, physiological acclimatization, and behavioral strategies every 10 years over the next century for a total of 480 simulations across 288,000 sites. With these iterations, we could address the sensitivity of our predictions to ecologically important factors.
