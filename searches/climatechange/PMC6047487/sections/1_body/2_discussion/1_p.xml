<p class="p">Our study suggests that physiological acclimatization and behavioral avoidance have the potential to markedly reduce extinction risk under climate change. Recent meta-analyses have suggested that climate change will exceed the physiological capacities of ectotherms to tolerate warming (

 </xref>), but to date, studies have yet to link plasticity in multiple traits to an individualâ€™s capacity to balance their energy budget. Our results indicate that predictions without explicitly incorporating plasticity should be interpreted cautiously. Our study also demonstrates that the incorporation of physiological and behavioral plasticity can improve the capacity of mechanistic SDMs to explain the geographic range of a species. By incorporating complex traits, mechanistic SDMs might identify the physiological and behavioral mechanisms that support the fundamental niche. We also predicted that warming might disproportionately threaten small individuals and juveniles, a common trend among many taxa under climate change (
