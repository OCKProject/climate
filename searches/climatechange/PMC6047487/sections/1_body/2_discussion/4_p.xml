<p class="p">Our results suggest that correlative SDMs overestimate extinction risk because they do not capture plasticity. Comparisons between correlative and mechanistic SDMs indicate that these approaches can produce similar predictions under climate warming (

  <italic class="italic">12</italic>
 </xref>). In our focal system, correlative SDMs have predicted suitable habitat for the global hotspot of salamander diversity to disappear under climate change (
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">27</italic>
 </xref>), a result that is similar to our simulations without plasticity. However, incorporating plasticity fundamentally altered our predictions of extinction by maintaining habitat suitability and reversing the change in energy balance during warming in the core of their range. Our analysis suggests that correlative models struggle to capture complex traits, such as phenotypic plasticity. More precisely, correlative models can predict whether populations will experience nonanalogous climates under climatic change (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">38</italic>
 </xref>), but they cannot evaluate whether an individual has the potential to survive and reproduce in nonanalogous climates. Correlative models are likely more appropriate for studies on current distributions, such as the discovery of unknown populations (
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">39</italic>
 </xref>) or factors beyond physiology, such as species interactions, that structure species ranges (
 <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">32</italic>
 </xref>). However, spatial layers derived from physiology can be incorporated into a correlative framework, and previous work indicates that incorporating mechanism can reduce the severity of extinction risk under climate change (
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">40</italic>
 </xref>). These findings bolster our claim that mechanism promotes a more flexible, and possibly realistic, perspective on the impact of climate warming, particularly if the model addresses uncertainty (
 <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">41</italic>
 </xref>). Studies like these can inform conservation strategies by providing perspective on the processes that threaten biodiversity.
