<p class="p">Reductions in body size represent a universal response to climate warming due to an increase in energetic costs that reduce energy available for growth (

  <italic class="italic">26</italic>
 </xref>). Our study reveals that large individuals exhibit a substantial advantage under warming in terms of energy balance and activity budgets, likely due to their low surface area–to–volume ratios, higher energy intake, and greater lipid reserves that minimize the risk of starvation. Our analysis is consistent with reductions in energy available for growth, resulting in reductions in body size; however, the reductions in body size might also reflect changes in the age distribution of a population or statistical artifacts due to nonrandom sampling (
