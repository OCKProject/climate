<p class="p">We identified three possibilities that could greatly reduce physiological stress of juveniles. These responses could ameliorate physiological stress imposed upon juveniles, but the possibility of one of these scenarios reducing extinction risk appears low, at least in isolation. For instance, we lack evidence that 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> is a heritable trait or that the required genetic variation exists for 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> to evolve. We also assumed that salamanders had immediate access to prey, and thus, the capacity to maximize energy intake will depend upon prey densities. Any reductions in prey abundances would inhibit their capacity to maximize energy intake. The analysis also indicated that a 20% reduction in metabolic rates could lower extinction risk for juveniles, and our experimental results suggest that salamanders can meet that demand (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). However, our simulations required that juveniles reduce metabolic rates by 20% during the entire year, whereas our empirical results indicated that salamanders only acclimatize during the warmest period of the summer. In isolation, these scenarios seem unlikely, but they are not mutually exclusive. Combinations of these responses might interact over time to lower physiological stress. In addition, juveniles might avoid lethal stress by restricting activity to saturated microhabitat, such as under leaf litter. These unexplored strategies might be critical for lowering physiological stress in the most vulnerable stage of life.
