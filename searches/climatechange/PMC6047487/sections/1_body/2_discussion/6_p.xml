<p class="p">Physiological and behavioral plasticity have been proposed as predictors of a speciesâ€™ susceptibility to climate change (

 </xref>). In accordance with this hypothesis, we discovered that physiological and behavioral plasticity reduced estimates of extinction risk under the most extreme warming scenario. We acknowledge that interpreting plasticity can be complicated by an incomplete understanding of the relative costs and benefits of plasticity. Physiological acclimation in lungless salamanders has been shown to reflect a trade-off between water loss rates and metabolic rates due to underlying physical and biochemical linkages (

  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
 </xref>). The trade-off has the potential to undermine the benefits of acclimation, but in our study, salamanders in the field-based experiments appeared to decouple physiological responses to thermal and hydric stressors without exhibiting an obvious trade-off. We also suggest further studies on the consequences of physiological acclimatization for behavior will improve our understanding of the costs and benefits of plasticity. Even with these caveats, our results underscore the need to include complex biological responses, such as plasticity and adaptation, into ecological predictions of climate change. These considerations will improve our capacity to understand whether physiological and behavioral plasticity can effectively meet the biophysical demand of climate change.
