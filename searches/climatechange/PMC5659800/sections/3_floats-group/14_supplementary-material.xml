  <title class="title">AICc metrics for Maxent models among multiple settings.</title>
  <p class="p">Maxent models were run with regularization multipliers ranging from 0.5 to 6.0 (increments of 0.5) using six different feature combinations (L, LQ, H, LQH, LQHP, LQHPT; where L = linear, Q = quadratic, H = hinge, P = product and T = threshold). Black arrows denote the AICc-selected models (i.e. minimum AICc values where delta AICc = 0). AICc-selected models settings are given in each box, together with performance metrics. Models were generated for the four subspecies separately, and for
