<p class="p">Binary predictions were based on 
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>Maxent outputs, as thresholding future predictions from ensembles is difficult. Overlapping the Central Route and Eastern Route of SNWD with the binary future predictions for

 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>.

 <italic class="italic">h</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> in 2050–2060, and its suitable areas will expand northward along the southern Eastern Route by 2080–2090 (

 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> may occur considering future climate warming, these potential expansion areas need to be better covered by future surveillance efforts. Future surveillance efforts should also consider potential re-emergence of

 <italic class="italic">guangxiensis</italic> and
