<p class="p">ENM tools, however, are also subject to issues including the need to balance goodness-of-fit against model complexity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], and the importance of considering uncertainty in model predictions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. These issues are particularly critical in studies involving transfer of models across space or time (e.g. climate change effects). Recent efforts have developed methods to reduce model complexity and characterize uncertainty, and thereby improve model transferability in forecasting climate change effects [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. These steps include species-specific tuning of settings (rather than default setting) to improve model performance [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], evaluation using spatially independent training and testing data sets [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], and integrating multiple predictions via ensemble approaches [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>].
