<p class="p">Schistosomiasis is a neglected tropical disease that is known to have affected people in China for more than 2100 years, with presently ~800,000 infected and ~65 million people at risk of infection [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The challenge of combatting this disease lies in the wide distribution of its snail hosts and the broad range of domestic and wild mammals that act as reservoirs for human infections [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Chinese schistosomiasis is caused by the digenetic blood trematode 
 <italic class="italic">Schistosoma japonicum</italic>, a parasitic flatworm that completes its life cycle through one intermediate (i.e. the snail 
 <italic class="italic">Oncomelania hupensis</italic>) and diverse definitive (i.e. mammals) hosts. Over the past five decades, China has made remarkable progress in reducing 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">japonicum</italic> infections in humans through a combination of chemotherapy and snail control, but schistosomiasis has re-emerged in recent years owing to changes in ecological and socio-economic factors, together with termination of the World Bank Loan Project on schistosomiasis control in 2001 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Given that schistosomiasis is unlikely to be eliminated, considering whether and how future climates are likely to impact its transmission becomes increasingly important.
