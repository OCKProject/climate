<p class="p">In this study, we used a unique dataset of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> presences from more than 5 thousand villages to explore ecological dimensions and potential distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> in mainland China. The aims of this study were to (1) compare climate spaces occupied by the four subspecies of 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic>, to (2) test whether climate niches were conserved during the four subspeciesâ€™ divergence (i.e. climate niche conservatism evaluation), to (3) predict their potential distributions using state-of-the-art modelling techniques, to (4) investigate the potential impacts of future climate change and the SNWD project on 
 <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic>. The overall purpose was to predict the 
 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">japonicum</italic> transmission risk at present and under climate change in mainland China.
