<p class="p">Based on the environmental variables that associated with species’ occurrence records, ecological niche modeling (ENM) seeks to characterize environmental conditions suitable (i.e. realized niche) for a particular species and then identify where suitable environmental habitats are distributed in the space [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Assumptions under which ENMs work best include equilibrium between species’ distributions and their ecological requirements, and conservatism of ecological niche [

Among them, niche conservatism providing support for using ENMs has been widely noticed, the degree to which plants and animals retain their ancestral ecological traits and environmental distributions ('niche conservatism') is hotly debated, in part because of its relevance to the fate of modern species facing climate change [
