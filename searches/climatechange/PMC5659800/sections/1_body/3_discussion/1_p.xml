<p class="p">Limitations on materials and methodologies employed in this study need to be addressed here. While this paper focused on climate drivers, these factors occur in a complex milieu of other non-climatic drivers of snail distribution and parasite endemicity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], although the non-climatic factors usually functioned at a small scale. Although we adopted ensemble forecasting approach to minimize the uncertainty of individual model predictions, the uncertainty exists in consensus models [

Future projections for species involved in disease transmission and likely to respond to climate change are usually fraught with uncertainties and complexities; however, these assessments are crucial in identifying appropriate mitigation strategies [

 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> across mainland China, and integrated state-of-the-art modelling techniques (
 <italic class="italic">f</italic>Maxent and ensemble models) to forecast climate change effects. Our results have important implications regarding genetic divergence of
