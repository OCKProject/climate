 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]) in which future anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions were estimated to peak around 2040. This scenario was chosen because it represents the middle range of available four scenarios, and as such is considered more realistic than models based on extremely high or extremely conservative scenarios [
