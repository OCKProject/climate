 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Rather than using centroids of infested counties, which reduces precision, we georeferenced individual villages using Google Maps. These points varied in terms of clumping, so we subsampled them to reduce sampling bias and spatial autocorrelation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], as follows. First, we arranged infested provinces according to sample density (i.e. number of occurrence points divided by area of the province). The median served as the standard sampling effort, and all provinces presenting densities above that value were subsampled randomly to a lower density. In the end, we had 1996 occurrence points: 1402
