Maxent is the most commonly used method in ENM, and it can fit arbitrarily complex models to explain relationships between environmental variables and occurrence data (version 3.3.3k; [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]). However, because an excessively complex model will be extremely specific to input data and perform poorly when extrapolating, Warren and Seifert proposed using a sample-size-adjusted Akaike information criterion (AICc) as criteria with which to address overfitting; this approach does not control model fit directly, but rather uses AICc to choose appropriate settings [

 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] to fine-tune Maxent models by seeking the minimum value of AICc among candidate models. ENMeval provides an automated way to execute Maxent models across a user-specified range of regularization multiplier (RM) values and features combinations (FC). We set the RM range to 0.5–6.0 with increments of 0.5, and used 6 FCs, to cover a broad range of model settings. The block method was used to partition occurrence data into four bins, 3 of which were used for training and the remaining one for testing (bin combination, BC), which is desirable for studies involving model transferring [
