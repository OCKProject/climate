<p class="p">The occurrence data used to fit the niche models were split randomly into two datasets, for calibration (70% of points) and interpolation evaluation (30% of points). Performance of individual and consensus models was evaluated via a partial ROC (receiver operating characteristic) approach [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Comparing to traditional AUC (area under the ROC curve), which was criticized because present data are more reliable than absence data in model evaluation [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], the partial ROC approach takes the quality of occurrence points into account and weights more on omission error [
 <xref rid="pntd.0006021.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]). Here, AUC calculations were limited to ROC spaces over which models actually made predictions, and only omission errors &lt;5% were considered (i.e.
