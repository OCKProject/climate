<p class="p">Final model runs incorporating all point data were used for visualizations and risk assessments. A modified least training presence threshold based on

 <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> to generate binary predictions. We did not generate threshold predictions in ensemble future projection because such predictions are not applicable and hard to interpret (i.e. individual models for generating consensus models were different in present and future predictions).
