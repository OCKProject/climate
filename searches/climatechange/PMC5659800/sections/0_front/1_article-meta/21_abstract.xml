 <p class="p">The South-to-North Water Diversion (SNWD) project is designed to channel fresh water from the Yangtze River north to more industrialized parts of China. An important question is whether future climate change and dispersal via the SNWD may synergistically favor northward expansion of schistosomiasis in China. Our models indicated increased suitability and range expansion in

  <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> in the future; an eastward and northward shift in 
  <italic class="italic">O</italic>.

  <italic class="italic">robertsioni</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">h</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">guangxiensis</italic>, respectively; and relative stability in 
  <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">h</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">gangi</italic>. The southern Central Route of SNWD will coincide with suitable areas for 
  <italic class="italic">O</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">h</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">hupensis</italic> in 2050–2060; its suitable areas will also expand northward along the southern Eastern Route in 2080–2090. Our results call for rigorous monitoring and surveillance of schistosomiasis along the southern Central Route and Eastern Route of the SNWD in a future, warmer China.
