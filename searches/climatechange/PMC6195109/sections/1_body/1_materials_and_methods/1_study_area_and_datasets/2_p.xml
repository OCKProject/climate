 <xref rid="ref-10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fick &amp; Hijmans, 2017</xref>), in the form of 19 bioclimatic data layers summarizing potentially relevant climate dimensions at 2.5′ spatial resolution. Parallel bioclimatic data layers were obtained for five downscaled general circulation model (GCM) outputs at CCAFS Climate (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.ccafs-climate.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.ccafs-climate.org</uri>). We considered 2050 and 2070 as future time slices, under two emission scenarios: representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. As such, we explored 5 GCMs × 2 time periods × 2 RCPs = 20 future transfers of models for the species.
