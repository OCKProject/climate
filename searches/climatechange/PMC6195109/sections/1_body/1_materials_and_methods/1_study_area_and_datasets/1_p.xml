<p class="p">Occurrence data were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility website (
 <uri xlink:href="https://www.gbif.org" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.gbif.org</uri>), with an initial total of 6,371 occurrence points corresponding to 15 infraspecies (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>; 
 <uri xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.cu3tvo" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.cu3tvo</uri>). These data were checked rigorously for georeferencing errors and spatial biases. Outliers and botanical garden-based points were removed through careful assessment of data source and consultation of record metadata, leaving 5,508 points for further analysis. To estimate the area (
 <bold class="bold">M</bold>) that has been accessible to the species over relevant time periods (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barve et al., 2011</xref>), which should be used as the model calibration area, we applied a buffer of 1,000 km around all of the known occurrence points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="ref-2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barve et al., 2011</xref>). In light of the relatively subtle differences between present and future potential distributions, and considering the problems associated with model transfers to other regions (
 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yates et al., 2018</xref>), we have opted not to transfer our models globally, but rather to explore implications of climate change within the 
 <bold class="bold">M</bold> region only.
