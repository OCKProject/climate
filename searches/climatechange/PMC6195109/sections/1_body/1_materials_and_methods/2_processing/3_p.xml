<p class="p">Finally, we developed binary models based on relationships between the calibration points and the raw model outputs. Threshold values were decided on the basis of the calibration dataset, identifying the highest thresholds corresponding to 0%, 5%, and 10% omission error rates. We calculated change in high, moderate, and low suitability areas in all future transfers as follows: 0–0.09 threshold value (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> = 0–5%) as low suitability area, 0.09–0.19 threshold value (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> = 5–10%) as moderate suitability area, and above 0.19 threshold value (
 <italic class="italic">E</italic> ≥ 10%) as highly suitable area. Future-transfer maps were thresholded based on the same criteria as the present-day models, and percentages of area were calculated to facilitate comparisons.
