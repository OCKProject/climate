<p class="p">Occurrence data were rarefied to leave no pair of points closer than five km using SDMTools (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown, 2014</xref>) in ArcGIS, reducing biases related to spatial autocorrelation. This spatial filtering reduced the number of occurrence points still further to 1,287. We divided these data into two equal parts at random to permit model calibration and evaluation. We also calculated Pearson correlation coefficients among environmental variables (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" class="xref">Table S1</xref>) to avoid using non-independent variables in model calibration. One from each pair of variables showing high correlations (i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> &gt; 0.9) is eliminated (

 <xref rid="ref-3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bemmels et al., 2016</xref>). Variable choice from each pair for retention is based on its variable importance in preliminary model runs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-3" class="xref">Table S1</xref>). Variables removed were annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of coldest month, temperature annual range, mean temperature of warmest quarter, and precipitation of wettest and driest quarters. We further removed mean temperature of wettest and driest quarters, and precipitation of warmest and coldest quarters, as they present odd spatial artifacts (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ribeiro et al., 2017</xref>). Variables used as predictors in final models are presented in
