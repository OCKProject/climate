 <xref rid="ref-22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Phillips &amp; Dudík, 2008</xref>) was used for calibrating models, as well as for assessing the importance of environmental variables (see above). Maxent settings were 5,000 iterations, 10 random replicate analyses, and 10% test sample size; all other options were left on default. For evaluation of model predictions, we used partial receiver operating characteristic (ROC) approaches (
