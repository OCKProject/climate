<p class="p">Ecological niche modeling (ENM) and the related ideas of species distribution modeling and habitat suitability modeling have gained popularity since they allow evaluation of potential geographic distributions of species under scenarios of climate change (
 <xref rid="ref-11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huntley et al., 2008</xref>). The approach employs information on environmental variables associated with ecological niche constraints on a species in relation to future distributions of those conditions as approximated by climate model outputs (
 <xref rid="ref-1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ara√∫jo &amp; Peterson, 2012</xref>). The result of these models is the coarse-resolution correlative model of the ecological niche, which makes geographic predictions of the distributional potential of species under present and future conditions. These models are evaluated for predictive ability based on careful testing with independent occurrence datasets.
