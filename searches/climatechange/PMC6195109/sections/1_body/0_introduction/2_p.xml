 <italic class="italic">Capparis spinosa</italic>, known commonly as flinders rose or caper bush, is an evergreen shrub that prefers dry heat and intense sunlight. The drought- and salt-tolerant nature of the species allows it to persist in a wide range of habitats, even on nutrient-poor, sandy, and gravelly soils (

 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sakcali, Bahadir &amp; Ozturk, 2008</xref>). The species is apparently native to dry regions of western and central Asia; however, long ago it spread to the Mediterranean Basin, southern Europe, North and East Africa, Madagascar, Australia, and Oceania (

 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chedraoui et al., 2017</xref>). Although sometimes considered a weed, it has a long history as an archaeophyte (

Flower buds, fruits, seeds, shoots, and bark of roots were traditionally used for pharmacological purposes, especially for treating rheumatism (
