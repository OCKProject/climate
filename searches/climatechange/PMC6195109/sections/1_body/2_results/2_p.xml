<p class="p">The potential distribution for the present day identified by our models indicates that this species is able to maintain populations in arid, semi-arid, and Mediterranean climate regions, including parts of Asia, Africa, Europe, and Australia (

 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) at different suitability levels were closely similar to present-day patterns (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Figs. 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">4</xref>). Overall, only minor differences existed in highly suitable area, with increases of 0.2â€“0.3% in suitable area under RCP 4.5 (2070) and RCP 4.5 (2050), respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Figs. 3</xref> and
