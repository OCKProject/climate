 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> summarizes relative contributions of environmental predictor variables to the model. The most important predictor variable was mean diurnal range (
 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), which is the difference between mean maximum monthly temperature and mean minimum monthly temperature. Mean temperature of the coldest quarter was the second most important factor for this species; the least important environmental variable was precipitation seasonality. Indeed, precipitation-related variables in general showed minimal contributions to model quality.
