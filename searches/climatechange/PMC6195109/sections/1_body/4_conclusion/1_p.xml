<p class="p">In this study, ENM was used to assess the likely current and future potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">C. spinosa</italic>, under different emissions scenarios for two time periods (2050 and 2070). These explorations revealed that, under future climatic scenarios, impacts of these changes on the distributional potential of 
 <italic class="italic">C. spinosa</italic> will be minimal. Temperature places strongest constraints on populations of the species. As this species can grow in hot and arid environments, this species may increase in the arid, semi-arid, and Mediterranean climate regions in the future.
