<p class="p">For both current and future time periods, countries having Mediterranean climates, with hot and dry summers (drought conditions) were predicted as highly suitable for this species, such as Portugal, Spain, France, Morocco, Italy, Greece, Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria, Armenia, and parts of Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, Algeria, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, Yemen, and Australia. Countries at higher latitudes were predicted to hold unsuitable habitat for this species: for example, Latvia, Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, China, Ireland, and UK. Variable contributions also revealed that hot and dry climates appear to be key for this species, as precipitation was much less important than temperature in model calibration.</p>
