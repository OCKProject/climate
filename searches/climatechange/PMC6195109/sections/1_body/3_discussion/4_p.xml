 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chedraoui et al., 2017</xref>). The medicinal properties of this species are appreciated across its native range. Our models indicate that climate change poses few or no direct challenges to its persistence. Anthropogenic pressures such as human population pressure and associated land-use change and livestock grazing, may reduce its populations, leading to soil erosion and desertification, which would require restoration and rehabilitation of land areas toward conservation. 
 <xref rid="ref-8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Chedraoui et al. (2017)</xref> presented a comprehensive review of the social, economical, and ecological properties of 
 <italic class="italic">C. spinose</italic>; the review also encouraged studies on this species in relation to climate change in the Mediterranean region, which is presented in this contribution.
