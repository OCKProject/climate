The partial ROC/AUC program generated AUC ratios ranging from 1.046 to 1.741 at the given 1- omission threshold of 0.95 using accepted omission error of 5% to the AUC at 50% for random prediction to specify the percentage of testing points which included in each of the random subsets. The models showed that the probability of the presence of infectious
