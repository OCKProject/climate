 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> distributions for all climatic scenarios. Relative contributions of each variable to our prediction results by iteration of the algorithm during regularization and by random permutation in the jackknifing procedure showed that precipitation of driest month (BIO-14) and temperature annual range (BIO-7) contributed more to the model output for the current scenario whereas precipitation of warmest quarter (BIO-18) and precipitation of driest month (BIO-14) had higher permutation significance for the current scenario. For 2020 climate scenario, precipitation of driest month (BIO-14) and mean diurnal range (BIO-2) contributed more whereas precipitation of driest month (BIO-14) and precipitation of warmest quarter (BIO-18) had higher percentage on permutation importance. For 2050 climate scenario, precipitation of driest month (BIO-14) and mean diurnal range (BIO-2) contributed more whereas permutation importance was only contributed by precipitation of driest month (BIO-14), precipitation of coldest quarter (BIO-19) and precipitation seasonality (BIO-15) only. Temperature annual range (BIO-7), mean temperature of warmest quarter (BIO-10) and temperature seasonality (BIO-4) did not indicate any contribution to model output in 2050 climate scenario (
