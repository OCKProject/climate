<p class="p">Predicted risk maps for 2020 and 2050 climate scenarios show risk intensification in dengue epidemic risks areas as previously identified in the current scenario. However, for 2020, the risk seems to disappear in parts of Iringa near Lake Nyasa and Ruvuma. Dengue risk indicated broad-scale potential for change and shift in the distribution towards the central part of the country especially for 2050 projections (Figs

Models show anticipated high-risk areas southern parts of Lake Victoria spreading to eastern parts of Lake Tanganyika while leaving higher emerging risks in many parts of the country. Predicted suitability probability for 2050 indicated risk intensification nearly in all parts of the country (
