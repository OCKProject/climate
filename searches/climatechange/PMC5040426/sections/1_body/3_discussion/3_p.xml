 <italic class="italic">A</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>, we estimate an intensification and shift of risk areas estimated from probability of occurrence of infected mosquitoes. Despite minor risk detected at the current scenario, Lake Victoria zone and northern areas of Tanzania have recorded detection of arboviruses such as Chikungunya virus and Rift Valley Fever among hospital based patients [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. The arboviruses use nearly similar climatic drivers similar to the ones causing dengue epidemics. Trends in change for temperature, rainfall and other environmental conditions influence the length of the immature stages by providing necessary resources within the larval habitats. Model projections into 2050 conditions predict increases in intensification and distribution of high risks area nearly in all parts of the country. Future climate models scenarios show spread of disease risk from coastal areas to towards the central zones of the country while intensification in areas surrounding lake zones continues. Therefore, the identified areas should be considered when monitoring for potential future epidemics.
