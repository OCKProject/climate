<p class="p">Despite that fewer bioclimatic variables were important predictors of the information generated by our models, their predictive performance and accuracy allows for inherited certain level of uncertainty from the modelled climate dataset that was used since the climatic conditions for the future are themselves predictions from the models [
 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Also, our ecological niche modeling approach use only one time infected mosquito occurrence records without considering other entomological parameters such as container index, Breteau index, house index and pupal index. We urge for a careful interpretation and use of results as our finding are only limited to climate change as the main driver of dengue epidemics, while other factors also present potential increase for future disease risk areas such as ecological imbalanced state as a result of habitat fragmentation, urbanization, land-use changes, and human-imposed species disequilibria, making some other areas especially susceptible to the uncertain effects of global change. These activities create favourable environmental conditions for survival of mosquito vectors hence may worsen the situation in the future. Despite these limitations, recommend surveillance for dengue fever epidemics originating in these predicted areas in the upcoming decades especially in the new suitable habitat surrounding the major lakes.
