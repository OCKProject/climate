 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> occurrence data was re-sampled with replacement by bootstrapping method to determine AUC ratios generated from proportion area predicted present and sensitivity. AUC ratios were calculated from observed data and random prediction. It was assumed that a good model would give AUC ratio above 1. Significance testing of model performance was done by plotting the AUC ratios replicates that would indicate a normal distribution.
