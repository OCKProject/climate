 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> co-occurrence with dengue were used together with bioclimatic data layers to develop ecological niche models. We used MaxEnt (version 3.3.1) to develop models for potential distribution of infected mosquito species in relation to reported disease cases. The dataset for all scenarios was split in the ratio of 3:1 for the training and testing respectively as previously done [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. We used default settings for MaxEnt except that we specified a random seed with 50% of points set aside for model evaluation together with the regularization multiplier factor to reduce over-fitting due to many bioclimatic variables. Modifying the regularization multiplier helped to generate risk maps that can be extrapolated to a larger countrywide scale.
