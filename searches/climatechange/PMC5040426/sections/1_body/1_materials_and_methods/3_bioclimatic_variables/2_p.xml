 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162649.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>
 <bold class="bold">)</bold> were annual mean temperature (BIO-1), mean diurnal range (BIO-2), isothermality (BIO-3), temperature seasonality (BIO-4), max temperature of warmest month (BIO-5), min temperature of coldest month (BIO-6), temperature annual range (BIO-7), mean temperature of wettest quarter (BIO-8), mean temperature of driest quarter (BIO-9), mean temperature of warmest quarter (BIO-10), mean temperature of coldest quarter (BIO-11), annual precipitation (BIO-12), precipitation of wettest month (BIO-13), precipitation of driest month (BIO-14), precipitation seasonality (BIO-15), precipitation of wettest quarter (BIO-16), precipitation of driest quarter (BIO-17), precipitation of warmest quarter (BIO-18) and precipitation of coldest quarter (BIO-19). In order to avoid the collinearity problem for MaxEnt, variables were chosen using several Jackknife procedures to identify their percentage contribution, permutation importance and relevance to infected
