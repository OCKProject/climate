<p class="p">Climate change represents a threat to emergence of more risk areas for dengue epidemics in Tanzania. Predicted distributions of risk areas present a cause of concern among disease managers. Results show that the influence of future climate scenarios on anticipated potential distribution of risk areas for dengue epidemic risk areas is immense and results will help in guiding future public health policy decisions on surveillance and control of dengue epidemics. A collaborative approach is recommended to develop and adapt control and prevention strategies that will help manage the anticipated risk. Concerted efforts are required towards adaptation to impact of climate change on vector-borne infectious diseases.</p>
