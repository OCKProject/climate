 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. The disease is endemic in more than 100 countries [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] and continue to spread worldwide due to emerging ecological distribution areas of disease vectors and the global movement of humans [
 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Climate has a significant role in mosquito distribution due to emerging favourable conditions especially rising temperatures [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Globally, climate change projections indicate an increase in mean temperatures ranging between 1.8°C and 4°C by the end of the 21st century [
 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In Tanzania, temperatures are expected to rise between 1°C to 3°C above baseline, and precipitation and extreme events are expected to increase in frequency by the 2050s [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Climatic change creates new ecological niches for vectors hence altering temporal and spatial distribution of vector-borne disease [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Climate change has been implicated as a contributing factor in dengue globally [

 <xref rid="pone.0162649.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Studies indicate that climate change and variability influence dynamics and potential spatio-temporal distribution of dengue vectors and hence potential of disease endemicity [
