<p class="p">Interestingly, exposure to hyperosmotic stress led to slightly higher heat tolerance (at least in males). This was not reflected the level of overlap among differentially expressed genes: Only 27 differentially expressed genes were shared between the two stress responses. However, the positive effects of hyperosmotic stress on heat tolerance might still be driven by a

In particular, ten of the transcripts that were upregulated in response to hyperosmotic stress were heat‐shock proteins, mostly isoforms of hsp 70. Although this was small component of the total response, recent work using RNAi to manipulate gene expression has shown that a change in the expression of a single heat‐shock protein can alter heat tolerance (Barreto et al.
