<p class="p">In contrast to results for the heat tolerance selection lines, we saw no evidence that the salinity selection lines had adapted to their native salinity regimes, with neither the low‐ or high‐salinity lines having improved fecundity or survival at their native salinities. However, despite the lack of adaptation to their native salinity, the low‐salinity lines showed substantial loss of tolerance to high salinity, with nearly 10‐fold greater mortality than controls at high salinity. One possible reason for lack of adaptation in the salinity selection lines is that we did not impose strong enough selection. In the heat selection lines, we imposed at least 50% mortality every generation, whereas the salinity selection lines just experienced a gradual increase or decrease in salinity. Alternately, it is possible that there is simply less additive genetic variance for salinity tolerance segregating between populations than there is for heat tolerance.</p>
