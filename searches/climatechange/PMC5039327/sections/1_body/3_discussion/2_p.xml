<p class="p">We also saw no evidence that selection for increased salinity tolerance leads to a loss of heat tolerance, indicating that the two traits are not genetically correlated. We selected for increased tolerance of both hyper‐ and hypo‐osmotic stress in hybrids by serially increasing or decreasing the rearing salinity of replicate lines over the course of five generations, but when we returned copepods from selected lines to ambient (35 ppt salinity), we observed no difference in heat tolerance of selected lines and controls. Our results are consistent with previous work in 
 <italic class="italic">Daphnia</italic> where lines selected for increased salinity tolerance also failed to show a cost of increased salinity tolerance at nonstressful salinities (Latta et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We also saw no evidence that selection for increased heat tolerance lead to decreased salinity tolerance, with similar survival at both high and low salinities for heat‐selected lines and controls.
