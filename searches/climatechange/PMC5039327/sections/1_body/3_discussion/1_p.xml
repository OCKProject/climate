<p class="p">Trade‐offs may influence both physiological and evolutionary responses to co‐occurring stressors, but their potential importance in shaping plastic and adaptive responses to climate change is poorly understood. We used laboratory selection and physiological tolerance experiments to test whether responses to heat and salinity stress (two important stressors in intertidal habitats) would incur trade‐offs in the copepod

 <italic class="italic">californicus</italic>. When we crossed populations that were divergent for heat and salinity tolerance and then selected for increased heat tolerance for five generations, we observed increased heat tolerance in selected lines, but also reduced fecundity. This finding is in contrast to previous work, where we were unable to demonstrate a fecundity cost in female

 <italic class="italic">within</italic> populations; it possible that alleles responsible for variation in heat tolerance
