<p class="p">The interactive effects of co‐occurring stressors will depend on the specific biology of individual stress responses. Here, we have shown that, depending on the physiological basis of the two responses, they can either dampen each other's effects, as in the case of heat and hyperosmotic stress, or heighten each other's effects, as in the case of heat and hypo‐osmotic stress. Our results highlight the need for more physiological studies in the context of responses to multiple stressors, as the responses we observed depended on the specific combination of stressors, and could not have been predicted from the individual stress responses. Our results also highlight the utility of transcriptomic techniques for understanding physiological responses to multiple stressors: relatively few studies employed transcriptomic techniques in this context (DeBiasse and Kelly 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and the upregulation of heat‐shock proteins under hyperosmotic stress provided a mechanism for the positive effect of hyperosmotic stress on heat tolerance, a result that would otherwise have gone unexplained. Finally, our results also have important implications for biological responses to environmental change. As one of the few studies to test both physiological and genetic trade‐offs incurred in tolerating multiple stressors, our findings imply that the synergistic physiological effects of multiple stressors may have more important consequences than evolutionary constraints imposed by genetic correlations among stress tolerance traits.
