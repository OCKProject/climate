 <sub class="sub">2</sub> generation, followed by generations of interlocus selection that purges incompatible alleles, so that hybrid populations may eventually exceed the fitness of either parental population (Pereira et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This underscores the importance of comparing selected lines with hybrid controls from the same cross, at the same generation. Because we expect the average effects of post‐hybridization intralocus selection to be the same for both selected lines and controls, we can then attribute changes in tolerance or fecundity (relative to the hybrid controls) to the effects of the selection regime, rather to the side effects of hybrid breakdown.
