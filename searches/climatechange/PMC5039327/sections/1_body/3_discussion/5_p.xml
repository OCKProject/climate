<p class="p">Despite the apparent lack of genetic correlation between heat and salinity tolerance, we observed synergistic physiological effects of heat and hypo‐osmotic stress, with copepods from low‐salinity lines held at their ‘native’ (15 ppt) salinity having ~1°C lower heat tolerance than control lines at ambient (35 ppt) salinity. However, we saw no evidence that the apparent physiological trade‐off between heat and salinity tolerance was driven by opposing effects on gene regulation. We observed 1488 transcripts that were differentially regulated in response to heat shock, but only 18 overlapped with the 357 transcripts responding to low salinity, indicating that the two stressors trigger unrelated physiological pathways. More likely, the observed synergistic effects of the two stressors are driven by competing energetic demands imposed by tolerating the two stressors. The response to hypo‐osmotic stress was dominated by transcripts involved in ion regulation, which may be quite costly (Kidder et al.

Although they involve nonoverlapping pathways, each response might incur energetic demands that would reduce tolerance to the other stressor. In addition, increased temperatures lead to increased permeability of membranes (Hochachka and Somero
