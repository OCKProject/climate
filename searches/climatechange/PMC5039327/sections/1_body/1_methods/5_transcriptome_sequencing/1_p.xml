<p class="p">We measured the transcriptomic response to heat‐shock and to hypo‐ and hyperosmotic stress using RNA sequencing. The response to heat shock was measured as part of a prior experiment (Kelly et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0223" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Briefly, we created six sequencing libraries, each from the pooled RNA of 30 hybrid copepods from the F4 generation. We created two libraries for each of three unselected control lines: one from 30 adults (males and females) that had been held at ambient temperatures and then flash‐frozen, and one from copepods that had been heat‐shocked for 1 h at 34°C, allowed 1 h to recover, and then flash‐frozen. To measure the transcriptomic response to low and high salinities, we created three libraries from individuals from the SD population for each of three salinities [low (15 ppt), ambient (35 ppt), and high (60 ppt)]: 50 copepods in each replicate were exposed to each salinity treatment for 1 h before flash‐freezing in liquid nitrogen.
