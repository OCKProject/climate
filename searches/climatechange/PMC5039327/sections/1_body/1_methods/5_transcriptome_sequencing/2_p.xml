<p class="p">Total RNA for all treatments was immediately extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plus Mini Kit. mRNA was isolated using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation kit and libraries were prepared using either the NEBNext Ultra RNA library prep kit for Illumina and the AxyPrep Mag PCR Clean‐up kit (salinity experiment) or the Illumina TruSeq kit (heat‐shock experiment) (version 2; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. The distribution of fragment sizes was verified by running libraries on a Bioanalyzer high‐sensitivity DNA chip, and library concentration was quantified with qPCR using a Kapa Biosystems kit. Barcoded libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations. 100‐bp single‐end reads were sequenced in two lanes (9–12 libraries per lane) on the HiSeq2500 platform using a TruSeq SBS sequencing kit v4 at the University of Illinois at Urbana‐Champaign Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center (salinity experiment) or at the University of Davis Genome Center Core Facility (heat‐shock experiment).</p>
