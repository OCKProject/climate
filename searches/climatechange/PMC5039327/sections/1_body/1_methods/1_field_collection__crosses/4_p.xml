<p class="p">To select for increased heat tolerance, we exposed &gt;80 mate‐guarding pairs to the temperature that produced 50–90% mortality for 1 h (36.0°C in the first generation of selection, increasing by ~0.1°C per generation of selection). We then established the next generation with 30 of the surviving mate‐guarding pairs. To select for increased tolerance of low salinity and high salinity, we placed 50 mate‐guarding pairs at 20 and 55 ppt, respectively, for each of five replicate selection lines. Thereafter, we decreased salinity by 2 ppt per generation for the low‐salinity selection lines, and increased it by 3 ppt per generation for the high‐salinity selection lines, and established each new generation with 50 mate‐guarding pairs.</p>
