<p class="p">Field collection and copepod culture are described in detail in Kelly et al. (
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Briefly, we established laboratory cultures of 
 <italic class="italic">T. californicus</italic> from two sites, Bodega Bay in northern California, USA (BB 39°20′N, 123°33′W) and San Diego in southern California (SD, 32°49′N, 117°16′W). At each site, we collected individuals from 3 to 4 tidepools. We initiated one laboratory culture for each pool, with 50 gravid females per culture, and maintained cultures at 19°C (
 <italic class="italic">Tigriopus</italic> pools in nature range from 0 to 35°C) under 12‐h light/12‐h dark conditions at ambient (35 ppt) salinity. We maintained cultures in the laboratory for two generations before establishing crosses. We kept generations separate and established each new generation with 40 haphazardly selected mate‐guarding pairs.
