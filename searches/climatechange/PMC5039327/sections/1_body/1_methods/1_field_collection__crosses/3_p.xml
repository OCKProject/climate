<p class="p">When the F1 generation reached adulthood, we created five replicate cultures, each established with 30 mate‐guarding pairs from the F1 generation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Replicate cultures were also maintained at 19°C as described above. Starting in the F2 generation, we split each replicate line into three selection treatments, selecting for tolerance to heat, low salinity, and high salinity, respectively. Selection lines were propagated for five more generations, before remeasuring heat tolerance and testing for trade‐offs between heat and salinity tolerance. From each F2 line, we also established an ‘unselected’ control with 40 haphazardly chosen pairs each generation.
