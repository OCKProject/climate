<p class="p">Previous work has established that copepods from northern and southern sites differ in their thermal tolerances, with LT
 <sub class="sub">50</sub> temperatures of 34.8 and 36.5°C for BB and SD, respectively, and also that genetic variation for thermal tolerance within sites is quite limited, with 99% of genetic variation for thermal tolerance partitioned between sites (Kelly et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We initiated the cross with 20 males from SD and 20 females from BB, teasing apart mate‐guarding pairs (males + virgin females) with a fine probe and then pairing each individual with a partner from the opposite population. To ensure successful mating had occurred, each pair was held separately in a 24‐well tissue culture plate until the female had produced her first brood. After that, all females and broods were combined into a single 500‐mL culture, and maintained as described above. We could be sure that each female mated only with the intended male because female

 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1985</xref>). Given that most of the genetic variation for thermal tolerance is partitioned between populations, we expected 20 individuals from each population to be sufficient to sample the majority of the genetic variation for thermal tolerance segregating between populations.
