<p class="p">Reads were trimmed of adapter sequences and low‐quality bases using the wrapper script Trim Galore v3.8 with Cutadapt v1.7 and FastQC v0.11.2 under default settings. We mapped reads to a transcriptome previously assembled from reads for the SD population by Kelly et al. (accepted). Briefly, the final transcriptome was assembled from 44,617,800 pairs of reads to obtain a transcriptome sequence for the southern population. The final collapsed and filtered assembly contained 59,519 contigs with an N
