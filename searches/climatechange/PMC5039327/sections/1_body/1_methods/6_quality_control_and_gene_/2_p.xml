 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Limma employs an empirical Bayesian method to estimate log‐fold changes in expression and has recently been shown to be more robust to false positives than methods that rely heavily on fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data (Law et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In limma, we fit a generalized linear model to the data, testing for differences in gene expression between heat‐shocked and ambient temperature treatments, between low‐ and ambient‐salinity treatments, and between high‐ and ambient‐salinity treatments, setting the threshold for false discovery in all analyses to FDR &lt; 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg
