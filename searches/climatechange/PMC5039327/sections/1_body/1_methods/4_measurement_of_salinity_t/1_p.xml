<p class="p">We tested for an effect of selection treatment and ambient salinity on maintenance costs using a starvation experiment, under the assumption that selection + salinity treatment combinations with the lowest maintenance costs would have the longest survival during starvation (Evers and Kooijman 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1988</xref>). Three groups of ten adult females from each selection line were placed under common garden acclimation conditions (35 ppt, 19°C) for 72 h, and then one group of ten was moved to each of three test salinities: low (5 ppt), medium (35 ppt), or high (90 ppt), and held without food at 19°C for 17 days. We checked each container for mortality every 2–3 days and estimated per‐day mortality rates via individual cox proportional hazard models, fitted to each selection line × salinity combination in the R package ‘OIsurvival.’ We tested for effects of salinity, selection regime, and a selection × salinity interaction in a two‐way ANOVA, with individual lines as replicates, after first log‐transforming per‐day mortality values to achieve normality.
