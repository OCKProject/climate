<p class="p">Either physiological or genetic trade‐offs may alter the demographic response to environmental change. Within a generation, synergistic physiological effects of multiple stressors may produce a greater demographic impact than would have been predicted from either of the stressors’ individual effects. Across multiple generations, negative genetic correlations among stress tolerance traits may alter the likelihood of evolutionary rescue if selection for one tolerance trait tends to deplete genetic variation for the response to other stressors. However, despite their importance, the possibility of both physiological and genetic trade‐offs have rarely been tested together in the same system.</p>
