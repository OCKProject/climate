<p class="p">Physiological trade‐offs typically occur through competing demands on metabolism (Sokolova 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). For example, hypo‐osmotic stress can increase energy requirements of homeostasis through energetic costs of ion regulation (Kidder et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), and in ectotherms, the energetic requirements of basal metabolism increase with increasing ambient temperature. Thus, if available energy remains constant, higher temperatures should lower tolerance of hypo‐osmotic stress through competing demands for the same pool of resources. In the absence of energetic constraints, it is also possible for two functions to trade‐off more directly, as in the case where two functions require opposing changes in gene regulation. In either case, the effects of multiple stressors are poorly understood (Altshuler et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), and because stressors may interact in nonadditive ways, the potential effects of multiple stressors often cannot be understood from single‐stressor studies.
