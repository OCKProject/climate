<p class="p">Here, we report the results of a series of experiments using the intertidal copepod, 
 <italic class="italic">Tigriopus californicus,</italic> to test responses to two stressors commonly faced by organisms in coastal habitats: heat stress and changes in salinity. 
 <italic class="italic">T. californicus</italic> is a small (~1 mm) crustacean, abundant in rocky splash pools along the Pacific coast of North America. These pools are not regularly inundated by tides, and experience large fluctuations in both temperature and salinity. As a consequence, 
 <italic class="italic">Tigriopus</italic> is extremely tolerant of fluctuations in both temperature (Kelly et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and salinity, with the ability to survive salinities ranging from 2 to 100 ppt (&lt;1/10th to 3× normal sea water; Burton and Feldman 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1983</xref>). Heat and high salinity stress often co‐occur in this habitat, with pools becoming saltier and more thermally stressful as they heat up and evaporate. Shallower pools also experience greater hypo‐osmotic stress, as they are more easily flushed by rainwater. Given that heat and salinity stress may co‐vary in space and in time, we were interested in whether responses to these stressors might incur trade‐offs with responses to the others.
