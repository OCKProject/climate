<p class="p">In many ecosystems, the environment will change rapidly along multiple axes in the coming century, so that the physiological demands imposed by multiple stressors may constrain both plastic and evolutionary responses to global change (Crain et al.

 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). These constraints will be driven by trade‐offs, which occur whenever two traits cannot be simultaneously optimized (Agrawal et al. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). This can happen at a genetic level, when two traits are genetically correlated, thereby constraining evolution if selection acts in a direction that opposes the direction of their correlation (Walsh and Blows

 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Trade‐offs can also occur at the level of an individual organism's physiology, when resources allocated to one function cannot be allocated to another, thereby constraining the ability perform two functions (e.g., tolerate co‐occurring stressors) simultaneously (Sokolova
