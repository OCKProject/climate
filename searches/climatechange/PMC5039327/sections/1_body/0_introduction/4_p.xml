<p class="p">Importantly, two traits may be positively genetically correlated, but nevertheless experience a physiological trade‐off. For example, if stress tolerance traits are limited by resource availability, genotypes with greater ability to acquire resources may exhibit greater tolerance to both heat and hypo‐osmotic stress, leading the two traits to appear to be positively genetically correlated (Houle
