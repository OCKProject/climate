<p class="p">Genetic trade‐offs occur because genetic variation and natural selection are usually multivariate, and evolution depends on the degree to which genetic variation is aligned with the ‘multivariate direction of selection’ (Blows and Hoffmann 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Although genetic correlations are unlikely to completely halt evolution (Schluter 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), they can easily slow the rate of adaptation (Walsh and Blows 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>), an important consideration given the present rate of environmental change (Hellmann and Pinedakrch

For example, a population might possess genetic variation for tolerance of high salinity, and genetic variation for tolerance of thermal stress, but if there is a negative correlation between these two traits, adaptation to both stressors simultaneously will occur more slowly than to either one in isolation, such that the diminished rate of evolutionary change might preclude evolutionary rescue. Relatively few studies have considered trade‐offs involved in stress adaptation (but see Etterson and Shaw
