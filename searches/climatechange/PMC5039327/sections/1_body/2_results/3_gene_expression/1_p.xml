<p class="p">We mapped sequence reads to a previously assembled reference transcriptome and fit a generalized linear model to the data, testing for differences in gene expression between heat‐shocked and ambient temperature treatments, between low‐ and ambient‐salinity treatments, and between high‐ and ambient‐salinity treatments. Setting the threshold for false discovery in all analyses to FDR &lt; 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg 
 <xref rid="eva12394-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), we identified 1488, 357, and 488 transcripts responding to heat shock, low salinity, and high salinity, respectively, but very little overlap among the transcripts responding to each stressor (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The transcriptional response to heat shock was enriched for catalytic, hydrolase, and exopeptidase activities, while the hyperosmotic response was enriched for protein binding, response to chemical, and protein homodimerization activity (Fisher's exact test,
