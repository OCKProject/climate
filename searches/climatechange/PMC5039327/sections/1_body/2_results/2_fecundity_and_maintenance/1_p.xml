<p class="p">A two‐way ANOVA revealed no effect of salinity on fecundity (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2,35</sub> = 2.39, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.11), but a marginally significant effect of selection (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3,35</sub> = 2.86, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.051) with the lowest fecundity in heat‐selected lines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). After eight generations of selection, we used a starvation experiment to test for an effect of selection regime and ambient salinity on maintenance costs. A two‐way ANOVA revealed an effect of selection regime (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">3,36</sub> = 9.96, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and salinity stress (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">2,36</sub> = 32.1, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) on mortality rate, as well as an interaction between the two effects (F
 <sub class="sub">6,36</sub> = 2.38, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.048, Fig. 
 <xref rid="eva12394-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, a 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test provided no evidence for adaptation of either the low‐ or high‐salinity selection lines to their native salinity regimes, as neither had a mortality rate lower than the control at its respective salinity (Tukey HSD &gt; 0.05). We observed the highest mortality rate in hypo‐osmotic selection lines under high salinity stress, which had a greater mortality rate than all of the other selection and salinity treatment combinations in a 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> comparison (Tukey HSD, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
