<p class="p">To date, studies attempting to incorporate genetic variation into ENMs primarily use neutral markers to identify phylogeographic structure and generate separate models for each genetically distinct population. These have resulted in more pessimistic forecasts than traditional ENMs, predicting increased threats from climate change due to range losses in vulnerable populations (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>), but have not affected projections of range size changes at the species level (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). These attempts are limited in scope because neutral markers provide information on the speciesâ€™ evolutionary history and barriers to gene flow but not on the ability of individuals to adapt and survive under changing conditions. Moreover, range shifts under future climate change are predicted to result in genetic homogenization across species ranges and loss of historic and current population subdivisions (
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>). More recent studies integrated genomic adaptations with ENM projections to identify vulnerable populations that will need to adapt to survive under future climate change (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). However, genetic data related to intraspecific variation in climatic adaptations have yet to be directly incorporated into ENMs.
