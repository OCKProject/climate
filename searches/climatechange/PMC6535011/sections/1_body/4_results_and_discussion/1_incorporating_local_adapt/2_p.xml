<p class="p">Plotting the multilocus adaptive genotypes of individuals in a constrained ordination space, we classified 34% of 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> individuals as adapted to hot–dry conditions, 50% as adapted to cold–wet conditions, and the rest as intermediate genotypes. Based on the proportion of these individuals in each population (sampled from cave roosts), we classified six 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> populations, mainly from Portugal and southern Spain, as primarily adapted to hot–dry conditions; eight, mainly from northern Spain and the Pyrenees, as cold–wet adapted; and four as mixed (

 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic>, 45.6% of individuals were classified as adapted to hot–dry conditions, and 36.8% were classified as adapted to cold–wet conditions. Most of the cold–wet-adapted individuals were found in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Massif Central, France (

 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic> because it primarily roosts in trees and switches roosts regularly, and therefore, colony roost locations are unknown.
