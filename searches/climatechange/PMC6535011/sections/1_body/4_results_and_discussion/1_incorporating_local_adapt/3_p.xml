<p class="p">Intraspecific variation in local climatic adaptations was incorporated into ENMs by generating separate models for hot–dry- and cold–wet-adapted individuals and comparing predictions to models generated using all of the known geographic location records of each species. ENM projections are sensitive to variability resulting from the modeling approach, general circulation model (GCM), and greenhouse gas emission scenario used. To address these sources of variability, which can affect future range loss projections (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>), we employ an ensemble modeling approach (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>), averaging projection results across model algorithms, three GCMs, and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios representing the worst-case and a more moderate emissions scenario. All ENMs had strong support and good discrimination ability [mean values are true skills statistics (TSS): 0.766 ±0.03; area under the curve (AUC): 0.929 ±0.02; AUC cross validation: 0.866 ±0.03;
