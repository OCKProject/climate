<p class="p">Considering adaptive variation increased the predicted potential for interspecific competition, through increased range overlap. Range overlap between species in Iberia was predicted to decrease under future conditions (84% reduction, from 10.5 to 1.7% of Iberia), but estimations of future range overlap were more than 4 times higher when the ranges of hot–dry and cold–wet individuals were combined (7.1%;
