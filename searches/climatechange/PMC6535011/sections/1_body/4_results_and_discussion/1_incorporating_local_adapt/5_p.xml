<p class="p">Hot–dry-adapted 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> individuals are the only group predicted to have substantial increases in climatic suitability across Europe (+34%) under future climate change. However, increases are projected mainly outside Iberia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2 
  <italic class="italic">B</italic> and 
  <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 </xref>), where the species is not currently found [except in the Pyrénées-Orientales in France (
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>)] and where it is likely to encounter interspecific competition with two cryptic congeners, 
 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis nattereri sensu stricto</italic> (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). However, more modest range gains (+5.7%) are also projected within Iberia. 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> is restricted to its glacial refugia, likely due to range expansion limitations imposed by interspecific competition (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). The life history traits, habitat specialization, and restricted distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> suggest it is particularly vulnerable to climate change (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). However, our study predicts that 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> will be able to survive in situ across much of its currently occupied range as a result of its adaptive capacity.
