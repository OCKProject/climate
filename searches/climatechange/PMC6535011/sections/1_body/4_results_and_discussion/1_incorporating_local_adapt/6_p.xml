<p class="p">Overall, hot–dry genotypes are predicted to expand their range at the expense of cold–wet genotypes. However, survival at the trailing (equatorward) edge of species ranges depends on the maximum thermal tolerance of the species. Species living in warm environments may be unable to physiologically adapt to increased heat because their niches are close to their upper thermal limits, which were shown to be phylogenetically conserved and therefore less likely to evolve (
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>). On the other hand, at least for ectotherms, the equatorward range limit does not reflect maximum warm temperature tolerance, and therefore, species may be able to physiologically tolerate higher thermal stress at their warm range limits under future climate change (
 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>). Genomic data support the genetic basis of greater thermal tolerance in individuals living in warmer microclimates under higher heat stress (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). In contrast, individuals adapted to cold–wet conditions will experience the most severe range losses. Cold–wet
