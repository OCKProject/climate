<p class="p">Our results are supported by previous studies that used common garden experiments to show that incorporating information on local adaptations decreases future range loss projections for pines (

Genomic studies of local adaptations offer an alternative approach to understanding adaptive responses to climate change when reciprocal transplant or common garden experiments are unfeasible due to biological, practical, or ethical reasons, as is the case with many vertebrates and species of conservation concern (
