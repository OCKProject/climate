<p class="p">Gene flow among populations can increase the speed of adaptation to warmer conditions, but it can also reduce nonclimatic local adaptations and therefore reduce population fitness and evolvability (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>). Given these limitations, it is not surprising that evidence of evolutionary rescue in the wild is rare, although this may be at least partially due to logistical difficulties in obtaining both population dynamics and evolutionary change data (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>). Nevertheless, given the rapid rates of climate change relative to rates of evolutionary response, long-lived organisms may struggle to evolve fast enough to keep up with changes (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>) unless rates of gene flow from already adapted populations are high enough to allow adaptive variation to rapidly spread through climatically maladapted populations. This stresses the importance of approaches like the one developed in this study that can identify landscape barriers to gene flow between climatically adapted and maladapted populations and therefore can advise on how species should be managed to increase population connectivity.
