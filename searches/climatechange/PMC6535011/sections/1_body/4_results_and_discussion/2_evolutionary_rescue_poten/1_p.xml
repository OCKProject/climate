<p class="p">We use gene flow as a result of the movement of adapted individuals between populations to estimate the ability of a population to avoid extinction due to environmental stress through adaptation to the changed environment (evolutionary rescue). Increased thermal tolerance can evolve over a few decades in small organisms with short generation time (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>). However, in long-lived organisms with small population sizes, the potential for evolutionary rescue depends primarily on standing genetic variation and is facilitated in structured populations by local dispersal (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). Detecting local adaptations can help with identifying populations that will need evolutionary rescue, as well as potential donor populations that already show a signature of adaptations to warmer and drier conditions.
