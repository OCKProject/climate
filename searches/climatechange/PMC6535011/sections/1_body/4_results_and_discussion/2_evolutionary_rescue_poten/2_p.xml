<p class="p">Given that the studied bat species are forest specialists, both range shifts and the movement of adaptive genetic variation among populations via individuals’ dispersal are likely to be limited by landscape connectivity. We use a landscape genetics approach (
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>) to first identify landscape barriers to gene flow and then extrapolate how these will affect the potential for evolutionary rescue from hot–dry- to cold–wet-adapted locations. Genetic connectivity in both species was most strongly related to the combination of forest cover and slope (

Extrapolating these relationships to estimate gene flow potential from hot–dry- to cold–wet-adapted locations shows that landscape barriers to movement are likely to limit the ability of individuals adapted to hot–dry conditions to reach areas that will become climatically unsuitable for cold–wet-adapted individuals to prevent their extirpation under future climate change, even though these areas will become suitable for hot–dry genotypes (e.g., see

 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic>). On the other hand, in 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic>, although hot–dry-adapted individuals are not likely to be able to reach areas like the eastern Pyrenees (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3
  <italic class="italic">A</italic>
 </xref>), future ENMs show that much of this area will remain climatically suitable for cold–wet-adapted individuals, suggesting that evolutionary rescue will not be necessary. However, it is important to note that gene flow in these forest bats is limited by forest cover, which is likely to change substantially under future climate change (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). Our data also reveal cold–wet locations that harbor individuals adapted to hot–dry conditions (and vice versa;

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Figs. S1 and S2
 </ext-link>). The identification of these locations, where gene flow may already be providing genetic variation for future adaptation, illustrates how environmental surrogates for adaptive potential may sometimes fall short in informing conservation planning.
