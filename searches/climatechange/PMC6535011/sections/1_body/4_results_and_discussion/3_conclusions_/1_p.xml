<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Using a combination of population genomics, spatial ecology, and predictive modeling we show the importance of incorporating genomic data into climate change forecasts. Local adaptations can be a major determinant of the adaptive capacity of populations to changing climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) and therefore should not be ignored in climate change vulnerability assessments (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>). Greater intraspecific than interspecific climatic niche dissimilarities highlight the need to account for intraspecific differences in climatic tolerance when forecasting impacts of future climate change. Our study provides an unprecedented example where climate-adaptive genetic variation is directly incorporated into ENMs, rather than only using local adaptations as a measure of sensitivity (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>) or relying on neutral population structure as a proxy for intraspecific adaptive variation (
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). We show that considering adaptive genetic variation can reduce range loss projections, indicating that current forecasts of extinction risk from climate change are likely an overestimation of the proportion of species committed to extinction. An exception may be species with limited adaptive variation or genetic constraints that have limited capacity to show an adaptive response. Dispersal limitations and increased potential for interspecific competition when considering adaptive genetic variation, due to increased projected future range overlap, stress the role of biotic interactions in limiting species range shift and the persistence of climatically maladapted (or less adapted) species. The fate of populations at the trailing (equatorward or low elevation) edge will depend on the species’ physiological maximum thermal tolerance, while what will happen in areas that will become unsuitable for cold–wet-adapted individuals but suitable for hot–dry genotypes will depend on gene flow from hot–dry-adapted populations. As the example of our forest bats shows, the survival of maladapted populations may be possible through evolutionary rescue, but evolutionary rescue depends not only on individual adaptive capacity but also on landscape connectivity. As such, climate-adaptive conservation management should consider local climatic adaptations and focus not only on areas with threatened populations but also on facilitating movement between populations.
