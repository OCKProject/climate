<p class="p">Vulnerability to climate change is most commonly assessed based on forecasted distributional changes using ecological niche modeling approaches (also known as species distribution models), which project future changes in the distribution of suitable climatic conditions that characterize speciesâ€™ current ranges (

A major limitation of these approaches, which can lead to erroneous predictions and misplaced conservation efforts, is the disregard of intraspecific climatic adaptations and the consequent differences in population responses to climate change (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). Evidence of contrasting patterns of physiological variation in thermal tolerance among and within species highlights the importance of incorporating intraspecific variation in climatic adaptations into ecological niche models (ENMs) (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>). However, such model improvements are limited by the paucity of observational and experimental studies of local climatic adaptations (
