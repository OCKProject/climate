<p class="p">To address this gap, our study develops an approach to forecast range changes under future climate change for individuals adapted to different climatic conditions and to determine the evolutionary rescue potential of populations [the ability of populations to persist through adaptation to the novel conditions (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>)]. This requires first identifying local climatic adaptations in wild populations by using genotypeâ€“environment association (GEA) analysis and then incorporating this information directly into ENMs and projections of future range losses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The applicability of our approach is tested using spatial and genomic data from a pair of cryptic Mediterranean bat species with relatively limited long-distance dispersal abilities, 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis escalerai</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Myotis crypticus</italic>, that have only recently been confirmed as separate species (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> is endemic to the Iberian Peninsula (Spain, Portugal, and the Balearic Islands) and the eastern French Pyrenees, while 
 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic> is found across Italy, southern France, the Pyrenees, and the north of Spain (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). The current distributions of both species overlap across the north of the Iberian Peninsula but are likely limited by interspecific competition (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). As such, these species offer a good study system to simultaneously look at the effect of local climatic adaptations and interspecific interactions on the current and future distributions of species that are restricted to areas particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
