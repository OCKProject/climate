<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Climate change is predicted to result in widespread population and species extinctions (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>), and climate-related local extinctions have already been observed in hundreds of species (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). However, an equivalent number of species did not experience local extinctions at their warm range edge (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>), indicating that either phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptations may enable some populations to persist under warmer conditions. This highlights the importance of incorporating intraspecific adaptations into climate change vulnerability assessments (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>). However, methodologies to adequately incorporate genomic data into projections of species responses to current and changing climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>) and into conservation management strategies (
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>) are still missing.
