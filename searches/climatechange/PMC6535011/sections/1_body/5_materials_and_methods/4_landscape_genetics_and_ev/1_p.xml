<p class="p">The landscape genetics analysis for 
 <italic class="italic">M. escalerai</italic> was carried out at the population level (18 populations, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 162), while for 
 <italic class="italic">M. crypticus</italic> it was carried out at the individual level, retaining a single sample (the first sample) from each location (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 47). The extent of the analysis was set as the respective species’ ranges. Landscape variables (including habitat suitability, forest cover, land cover, topographic, and climatic variables) were converted to resistance cost surfaces in ArcGIS and assigned costs ranging from 1 (no resistance to movement) to 100 (strong barrier to movement) (

 <xref rid="r48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>) was used to calculate resistance distance matrices between populations or individuals and estimate potential movement pathways across the landscape based on the cumulative cost of movement due to landscape resistance. Although bats are capable of flight, the studied species have relatively limited dispersal ability (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>) and therefore are more likely to have a landscape-mediated population structure (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>). Potential for evolutionary rescue was determined according to the potential for gene flow from hot–dry-adapted to cold–wet-adapted populations and individuals based on the effect of the landscape on current patterns of genetic differentiation (
