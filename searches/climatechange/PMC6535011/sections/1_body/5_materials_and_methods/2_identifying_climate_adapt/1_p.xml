<p class="p">We carried out a GEA analysis to identify a signature of climate-driven genetic variation based on associations between allele frequencies and local conditions. We focused on two ecologically relevant climatic variables, maximum temperatures of the warmest month and precipitation of the warmest quarter (Bio5 and Bio18, downloaded from WorldClim,

RDA was used to plot the spread of individuals in the ordination space based on their climate-adaptive SNPs relative to the maximum temperature and summer rainfall axes (
