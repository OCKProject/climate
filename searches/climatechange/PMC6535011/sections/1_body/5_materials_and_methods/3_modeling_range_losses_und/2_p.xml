Models included bioclimatic variables (downloaded from WorldClim), a static topographic variable that is independent of temperature changes (slope, generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) altitude map,

Models were projected to the future (2070) using three ceneral circulation models [Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2 Earth Systems model (HadGEM2_ES), Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace Coupled Model 5th Assessment Low Resolution (IPSL-CM5A-LR), and Max Planck Institute for Meteorology Earth System Model Low Resolution (MPI-ESM-LR)] and two RCP scenarios (
