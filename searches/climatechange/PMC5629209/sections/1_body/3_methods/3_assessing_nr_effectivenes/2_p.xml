<p id="Par20" class="p">We measured the effectiveness of NR in carbon stocks by calculating the amounts and rates of change in forest area and biomass carbon density inside and outside the NRs in 1988 and 2012. We measured the relative change rate in biomass carbon density for individual NR or for the NR network as a whole. We then performed pairwise comparison to identify the difference of carbon density between inside and outside NRs in 1988 and 2012.</p>
