<p id="Par19" class="p">In order to avoid the effect of the newly established NRs on the assessment results, we excluded these NRs established in the last 10 years, and finally included 25 NRs in Sichuan Province into our analyses. We compared protected and non-reserve lands using the matching approach
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>
 </sup> to identify the difference of biomass carbon flux and stock between those areas inside and outside NRs since they were not randomly distributed over the landscape. Matching approach is a treatment or policy evaluation method that can help to reduce the influence of the non-random application of a ‘treatment’ (here, nature reserve). For each treated location, we chose the single untreated location that was the most similar to it in terms of the multi-variate distance between the locations’ vectors of land characteristics (tree species distributions, land cover, elevation, slope, distances to roads and villages, climate variables and soil organic carbon) using the Mahalanobis distance specified nearest neighbor matching approach. We carried out all further analyses in R, using the ‘Matching’ package. Summary statistics for all the above variables in controlled, treated and matched site are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. We assessed the differences between protected and unprotected site before and after matching, and found that matched methods greatly improved the similarity of these variables between inside and outside the NRs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>).
