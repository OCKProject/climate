<p id="Par15" class="p">The digital elevation model data with a resolution of 90 m was provided by International Scientific &amp; Technical Data Mirror Site, Computer Network Information Center, The Chinese Academy of Sciences. The level of human disturbance was expressed based on the distance from residential areas and roads. We obtained a road map (1:250,000) from the National Fundamental Geographic Information Center. We acquired locations of all villages from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources of The Chinese Academy of Sciences. The climate variables for Sichuan Province, including average annual temperature (Tavg) and precipitation (Pre), average annual monthly precipitation (Pre7) and maximum temperature (Tmax) in July, and average annual monthly precipitation (Pre1) and minimum temperature (Tmin) in January were derived from China’s ground-based meteorological data in 1988 and 2012. The land cover maps for 1988 and 2012 derived from Landsat imagery were obtained from the Forestry Department of Sichuan Province, and they were used for identifying forest cover and other land cover types.</p>
