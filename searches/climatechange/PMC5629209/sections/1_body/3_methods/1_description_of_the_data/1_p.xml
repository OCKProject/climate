<p id="Par14" class="p">We used two plot-based national forest inventory data sets (3615 plots for 1984 to 1988, hereafter referred to as 1988, and 3377 plots for 2008 to 2012, hereafter referred to as 2012) from the Forestry Department of Sichuan Province. The distance between these plots in Sichuan Province is 4 or 8 km. The locations and diameters of all living trees &gt; 5 cm at breast height were recorded. Each recorded tree was numbered and tagged to assist in a subsequent inventory. We also collected stand-based forest inventory data to obtain the spatial distributions and forest origins of 15 species group for 1988 and 2012, covering the 181 counties and districts of Sichuan Province. We carried out field studies in 2010 and 2011 to collect both aboveground (trunks, branches, and leaves) and belowground (roots and stumps) biomass samples for 46 tree species in 167 forest inventory plots, which were randomly selected from all the forest plots in Sichuan Province. Leaves and needles were collected by age class, and woody tissues were collected using a tree increment borer. The C content in each sample was determined with a Vario MAX CN element analyzer (NA Series 2, CE Instruments). The average C content for each species was obtained using the biomass of the different components (leaf, branch, stem, and root) as weighting factors. To build the individual tree-based biomass models, we also harvested 1310 sample trees from different diameter classes in each of the 15 forest species groups for biomass measurements in 2010 and 2011.
