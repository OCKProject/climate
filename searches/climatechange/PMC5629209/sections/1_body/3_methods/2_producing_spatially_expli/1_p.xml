<p id="Par16" class="p">To produce spatially explicit carbon distribution maps in 1988 and 2012, we first calculated plot-based biomass carbon density, and then scaled up the forest biomass carbon in Sichuan Province. The sampling method fully considered the different diameters, ages of forest species, and the distributions of the forest species types. We followed a destructive harvesting method
