 </sup>. We randomly divided forest inventory plots into training data (70%) and testing data (30%). The predictor variables input to RF included tree species distribution, geographic coordinates (X and Y), topographical factors (the slope and aspect), human disturbance (distance to villages and roads), and climate variables. We used the widely adopted thin-plate splines method of ANUSPLIN to interpolate the weather station data and obtain spatial distribution of these climate variables. The R

 </sup>. All analyses were implemented with the R package “Random Forest”. The land cover maps for 1988 and 2012 were used for identifying forest cover and other land cover types. We adopted carbon density data for other land cover types from the Forest Carbon Monitoring and Accounting Project, which was produced by massive field data and land cover data based on IPCC Tier 2 carbon budget assessment method.
