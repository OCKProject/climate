<p id="Par11" class="p">Second, planting forests is considered the priority management action for carbon sequestration, giant panda habitat restoration and dispersal corridor creation. A mix of trees, including native species, should be planted in potential giant panda habitats, especially in the zones between some isolated patches of giant panda habitats to link them together, since monoculture forests are not considered suitable giant panda habitat, nor are they valuable habitat in general for other wildlife

 </sup>. Future conservation efforts should also pay more attention to the forest structure and community composition. It has been suggested that temperate montane broadleaved forest, temperate montane mixed forest, and subalpine forest in this region, with 30–70% canopy cover, provide optimum conditions for bamboo growth and giant panda survival

 </sup>. Using these broad considerations as the basis, it is beneficial to judiciously consider promoting appropriate/optimal forest structure and composition when managing for forests and species conservation.
