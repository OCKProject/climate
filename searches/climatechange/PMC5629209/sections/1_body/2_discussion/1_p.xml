 </sup>. Our results indicate that the panda NRs substantially improved biomass carbon density after controlling for terrain, climate, human disturbance and land cover, and support the notion that giant panda conservation can highlight the potential of combining species and carbon conservation in future conservation planning. The benefits of the NRs on improving carbon storage in this study are likely to have been underestimated, because lots of newly established NRs have not been included into our analysis, which may have contributed a lot to carbon stocks in this region. However, our results also indicate that not all NRs perform equally in carbon stock potential. Therefore, to maximize the co-benefits, future conservation measures and funding should focus on primarily those NRs with high quality habitats and high carbon sequestration potential.
