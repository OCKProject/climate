<p id="Par12" class="p">Third, with giant panda being downgraded, the existing conservation efforts should not be relaxed, but there is a critical need to shift the traditional conservation approach to the new conservation mode. Conservation efforts should sustain the co-benefits of species conservation, carbon sequestration, and other ecosystem services despite the recent downgraded conservation status. The community forest tenure reform surrounding the panda NRs may also potentially threaten panda habitat protection and the carbon co-benefit, especially the high value natural forests

Alternatively, local communities could take advantage of the carbon co-benefits of panda conservation by selling carbon credits on the domestic and international carbon markets to improve the greatest return on limited conservation investment.
