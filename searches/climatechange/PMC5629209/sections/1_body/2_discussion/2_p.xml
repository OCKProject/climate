<p id="Par10" class="p">There are some feasible ways to achieve both giant panda conservation and climate change mitigation. First, preventing habitat fragmentation and isolation of forest ecosystems in the giant panda NRs would be the best conservation practice. Currently, the wild giant panda population is distributed in more than 30 isolated habitat patches, which can severely reduce gene flow, and population viability

 </sup>. Therefore, establishment of ecological corridors and more effective habitat protection that allow for greater mobility among core areas is essential to giant panda conservation in China. Sufficiently increasing the patch size and connectivity of panda habitats may also improve forest carbon stock

 </sup>, in addition to providing additional habitat that could eventually support a source population. A recent study in forest ecosystems found that increasing fragment size has a positive relationship with above-ground carbon stock, indicating that protecting forest fragments, particularly larger fragments, offers important carbon and biodiversity co-benefits in relevant conservation projects
