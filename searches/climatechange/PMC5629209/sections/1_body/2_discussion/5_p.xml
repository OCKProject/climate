<p id="Par13" class="p">Effective conservation policy will likely require maximizing future opportunities or strategies that concurrently support multiple conservation and management objectives. Such strategies, where possible, could reconcile species conservation and climate change mitigation. NRs, as one of the most successful measures implemented for species conservation contribute to carbon–biodiversity outcomes by improving both carbon sequestration and protecting biodiversity

 </sup>. Our results confirm that panda NRs play a critical role in reducing carbon emissions and habitat loss, and reveal important co-benefits between carbon stocks and species conservation in conservation landscapes. This result is consistent with other biodiversity studies, which found a positive spatial relationship between biodiversity and carbon

 </sup>. Therefore, the setting of regional conservation priorities should receive special attention in the planning investment to foster synergies between carbon and biodiversity, and maximize the potential of species and carbon co-benefits under climate change and limited conservation fund.
