<p id="Par4" class="p">Here we provide the first detailed analysis of the role the giant panda NRs play in carbon sequestration, and the relationship between giant panda habitat quality and biomass carbon density in NRs in the Sichuan Province. We produced spatially explicit maps of ecosystem biomass carbon stocks and land cover for 1988 and 2012 based on forest inventory data and field investigation, and then we adopted the matching method to compare the changes in carbon density inside and outside NRs over this period. Lastly, we analyzed the relationship between habitat suitability and biomass carbon density to explore the potential co-benefits of species and carbon conservation.</p>
