 <italic class="italic">Ailuropoda melanoleuca</italic>), a universal symbol of wildlife conservation, was once widely distributed across about one quarter of China, but its current distributions are restricted to about 1% of the historical distributional range in China

 </sup>. An extended period of habitat destruction, human disturbance, and climate change have all contributed to restricting today’s pandas to six isolated mountain ranges in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces

 </sup>. In these ranges, 46 nature reserves (NRs) have been designated to protect this species and its habitats, and four large-scale surveys (National Giant Panda Survey) have been carried out since 1970s to monitor their recovery. The results of these surveys indicated that both the wild giant panda population and their habitat range have greatly increased between 1980 and 2013. The population has steadily recovered from 909 to 1387 (52% increase), and the total area of nature reserves has expanded from 0.57 to 2.53 million ha (344% increase) in Sichuan Province (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The direct measures of changes in the provision of habitats for giant panda show that conservation efforts and forest restoration in the past decades have also greatly improved the quality and area of panda habitats

 </sup>. Despite these great conservation successes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>, it is unclear as to whether the current management plan can concurrently achieve both giant panda conservation and climate change mitigation, or whether these conservation policies need to be revised to take into account the escalating challenges of climate change mitigation and potential climate change-induced habitat shifts to non-reserve areas

 </sup> to enhance the greatest return on limited conservation investments, especially after the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) officially downgraded its conservation status from “endangered” to “vulnerable”, which may lead to a lower security for pandas, mainly because the potential conservation investments would be reduced.
