<p id="Par6" class="p">NRs contributed to improved regional carbon sequestration. The studied NRs and their matched sites (non-reserve; similar land characteristics) contained approximately 56.1 M t C and 55.8 M t C of biomass carbon in 1988, respectively. In 2012, the total biomass carbon inside NRs and matched sites increased to 64.3 M t C and 60.7 M t C respectively, suggesting that the establishment of the NRs increased carbon sequestration by 3.6 M t C. Pairwise comparisons revealed that there was no significant difference in 1988 mean biomass carbon density between protected and unprotected sites. In 2012, it was significantly higher inside the NRs than matching non-reserve sites (Fig.

To distinguish carbon gain through forest regeneration, we calculated the mean biomass carbon density of the entire NRs and those areas covered by forest in both periods. The mean carbon density of the whole NRs increased from 50.5t/ha to 56.2 t/ha, exhibiting a 4.2% higher growth rate compared with lands outside of NRs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3d</xref>). For the areas covered only by forest in both periods, the mean biomass carbon density increased from 70.0 t/ha to 77.8 t/ha inside the reserves (11.2% increase), and an increase from 69.4 to 74.3 t/ha outside the reserves (7.1% increase; Fig.
