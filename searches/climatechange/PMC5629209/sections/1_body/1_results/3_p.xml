<p id="Par7" class="p">We also individually analyzed the contribution of each NR to forest carbon sequestration to illustrate spatial heterogeneity of the impacts. Our results indicated that 23 of 25 NRs showed improved biomass carbon density, with a maximum relative growth rate of 14%. Compared with the matching non-reserve areas, biomass carbon density in 12 NRs increased by over 5%, and 3 NRs (Tangjianghe, Labahe, and Piankou) exhibited a relative growth rate of over 10%. The relative change rate of biomass carbon density in protected sites, compared with non-reserve sites, was found to decrease in only two NRs. These two NRs were located in Liangshan and Daxiangling Mountain Ranges, the southern parts of giant panda habitats in Sichuan Province (Fig.Â
