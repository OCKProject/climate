<p id="Par8" class="p">To investigate potential synergies between carbon stock and giant panda conservation, we explored the relationship between mean biomass carbon density and habitat suitability index at cell scale in each NR and at NR level. We found high congruence between species habitat suitability and biomass carbon density in most of the 25 NRs. Indeed, there were not significant relationships between the two variables in only four NRs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We also found that there was a significant correlation between the two variables at NR level (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.59, p &lt; 0.001) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Further, the mean carbon density for habitats with different quality was significantly different, i.e. the mean carbon density of the highly suitable habitats was higher than that in the moderately and low suitable habitats. Overall, our results support the expectation that mechanisms for conserving biomass carbon would have substantial co-benefits for giant panda habitat, and vice versa. This to our knowledge for the first time verifies the synergisms between species conservation and carbon stocks at a landscape scale, suggesting the potential co-benefits between species conservation and climate change mitigation in these giant panda habitats.
