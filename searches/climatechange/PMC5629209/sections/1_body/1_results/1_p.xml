<p id="Par5" class="p">In 1988 more than 50% of these studied NRs were covered by all forests (both non-natural and natural forests) (0.75 M ha). Non-natural forests include secondary forests and plantation in this area. By 2012, forests in the NRs generally expanded (0.02 M ha, 3.1% increase), while forests outside of NRs with the most similar land characteristics suffered forest loss (0.01 M ha, 1.3% loss) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Specifically, forests in the NRs experienced 0.12 M ha of conversion or transition to another land cover, and 0.14 M ha of reforestation, whereas forests outside of NRs outside of NRs experienced 0.14 M ha of conversion and 0.13 M ha of reforestation. We also estimated the effect of protection on natural forest during this period to permit more accurate conservation impact estimates. The area of natural forest in NRs decreased from 0.51 M ha to 0.41 M ha, while it dropped from 0.50 M ha to 0.37 M ha in non-reserve lands (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>). Our results indicated that despite their status as NR, natural forest loss still occurred, but that this loss in panda NRs was reduced compared to lands not declared as reserves.
