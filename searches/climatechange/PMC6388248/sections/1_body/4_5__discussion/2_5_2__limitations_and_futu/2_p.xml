<p class="p">It is also important to note that this study has focused on developing sustainable protocols to mitigate climate change effects in cities facing fewer normal winter days. Such analysis is aimed at targeting environmentally vulnerable areas for improving urban resilience for all-season scenarios as long-term mitigation, which short-term strategies such as emergency planning might not provide. Thus, a future study to combine results of this study and disaster planning protocols for extremely cold days is essential for the purpose of developing a higher-hierarchy framework designed for city planning and land policy. The importance of our current results suggest that future study should be focused on the improvement of physical environments and urban design for long-term mitigation, instead of on disaster plans for extreme days that focus more on usage of the urban design for resource allocation, emergency response, and socioeconomic support [
