<p class="p">Finally, this study used the AWCET instead of the temperature indices for all-seasons such as physiological equivalent temperature (PET) and universal thermal climate index (UTCI). It was based on a hypothesis that this study not only aimed to evaluate the discomfort caused by increasing temperature, but also to project a scenario of how the spatiotemporal variability of winter perceived temperature is different for the temperate city and how the magnitude of this difference is stronger when the relative AWCET has been increased. More importantly, previous study [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>] has also noted that even common indices for all-seasons such as PET and UTCI are not interchangeable, since the design and representation of each index is totally different. Therefore, it is important to note that using different indices will significantly affect the results, while this must be based on hypotheses before modelling and applications.
