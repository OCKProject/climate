<p class="p">In this study, only government-based weather stations were used to map air temperature and for simulating the wind speed. However, recent studies have also pointed out that volunteered geographic information (VGI) may be able to enhance the urban climate prediction, especially in increasing spatial variability [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], there is no relevant information for a longitudinal study. For future investigation, weather information from VGI networks, such as Weather Underground (www.wunderground.com) and the Community Weather Information Network (weather.ap.polyu.edu.hk), can be used to enhance spatial prediction of winter perceived temperature.
