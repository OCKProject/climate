<p class="p">In addition to the selection of environmental criteria for sustainable urban improvement, understanding socioeconomic disparities when community planning is also important. While city planning for better environmental health should follow a scheme that can reduce issues caused by active aging, such as the “Towards an Age-Friendly World” scheme promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO), major problems in the socio-environment may be far more than just an issue of a large population of elderly people. For example, this study has found that the aging population has been well-protected in current urban design, while other types of vulnerable populations, such as lower income populations, have less protection from climate mitigation based on the current design of the city. Thus, planning for the improvement of urban environments should also focus on the needs of different vulnerable populations. This is also aligned with the sustainable development goal of the United Nations, in which “no-one left behind” is the core of future sustainable planning. Based on this, a multi-level urban design should be developed, in which macro-scale design for planning protocols of the general environment should be applied across a city and micro-scale planning with specific urban design should be conducted by weighting the proportion of vulnerable populations (e.g., the percentage of socioeconomically deprived populations).</p>
