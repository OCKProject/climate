<p class="p">Based on the analysis, areas with significant increases in winter perceived temperatures were observed across the urban environments of a compact city. The results of this study have also indicated that urban design has been applied to the city for climate change mitigation. For example, areas with higher building density and a higher percentage of road network in recent years were not associated with areas of increased perceived temperature. However, there is still a need to improve the greenspace and public open space for mitigation across the urban environment; although the need for improvement is varied across neighborhoods, even among districts with different groups of vulnerable populations.</p>
