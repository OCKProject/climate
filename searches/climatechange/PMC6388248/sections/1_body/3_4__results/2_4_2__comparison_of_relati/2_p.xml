<p class="p">By overviewing the urban environment across the Kowloon Peninsula, this study has found that areas with an increased relative AWCET were surrounded by areas in 2010 with a lower percentage of urban green coverage and public open space than the areas without an increase of relative AWCET. The

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00497-t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>) have shown that the areas with an increase of AWCET had significantly (1.9%, 1.0%, 0.8%, 0.6%, and 0.7%) lower green coverage across spatial buffers of 100 m, 200 m, 300 m, 400 m, and 500 m radii, on average. Although there was no significant difference in the percentage of public open space between areas with and without increase of relative AWCET for the spatial buffers of 100 m and 200 m, this study also analyzed larger spatial extents (radii of 300 m, 400 m and 500 m). The areas with increased relative AWCET still had a 0.8â€“0.9% lower percentage of public open space than the areas without an increase. In contrast, the percentages of road network and average building density were not higher in the areas with an AWCET increase. This implies that the current urban settings have already been incorporated in reducing building density and road networks, however, sustainable design combined with urban greenery and public open space may still be insufficient, especially in targeting climate change mitigation.
