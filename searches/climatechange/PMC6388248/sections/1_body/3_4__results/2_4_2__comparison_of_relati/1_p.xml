<p class="p">Based on the results above, two resultant maps have been mapped as follows: (1) the average of relative AWCET between 1990 and 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00497-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>), and (2) the average increase of relative AWCET every five years between 1990 and 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00497-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Although about half of the regions in the study area have higher relative AWCET geographically, approximately half of the regions of this area of interest also have a higher than average increase of relative AWCET. These two subsets of “high-areas” were not spatially overlapped. A further comparison between these two maps was conducted, in which there was no correlation between the two maps (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.002). It implied that only using temperature across districts for climate change mitigation is inadequate, and that reduction of adverse impacts of climate change should include the increase of perceived temperature, especially increases in winter temperature.
