<p class="p">Based on a stratification of identified neighborhoods with higher socioeconomic deprivation, significant disparities in urban environments across different neighborhoods were observed. In brief, areas with higher low-income populations had much less greenspace and public open space than other areas across the Kowloon Peninsula, while areas with a higher senior population, which are usually identified as vulnerable neighborhoods due to aging issues in a city, had a much higher percentage of greenspace and public open space than other areas. These results also led to further disparities when areas with or without an increase in AWCET were compared and evaluated using the

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00497-t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>), this study observed that the need for more greenspace in these areas was similar to that in areas with an increase in AWCET. This is because the only group with a significantly lower mean was the area with an increase in AWCET and a lower percentage of vegetation within a 100 m radius. More areas have emerged with protective factors in recent years, especially areas with higher populations of children and young adolescent with increases in AWCET. Compared with the areas without increases in AWCET, we have only found a significantly lower mean percentage of public open space estimated based on a 500 m radius in areas where increases in AWCET exist, while this has not been found with the use of a radius between 100 m and 400 m.
