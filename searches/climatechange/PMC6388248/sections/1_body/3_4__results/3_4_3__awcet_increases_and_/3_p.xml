<p class="p">In contrast to areas with a higher senior population or areas with children and young adolescent populations that had more protective areas for reducing thermal distress, areas with high low-income populations were expected to suffer from urban thermal issues. In addition to those areas that already had less greenspace and public open space than other types of areas, the areas with an increase in AWCET had an average of between 2.1% and 4.0% less greenspace with a radius of 100 m to 500 m, compared to areas without an increase in AWCET. Among those areas with a higher low education population, the areas with an increase in AWCET had an average of between 1.5% and 3% less public open space in a radius of 100 m to 500 m. These results indicated that such neighborhoods will face severe effects of thermal stress on vulnerable populations due to the raising of temperature by climate change.</p>
