<p class="p">Areas of interest in this study have covered 45 TPUs across the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong. Among these 45 TPUs, the percentage of senior population in 2010 ranged from 3.1% to 26.0%, with a median of 16.6%. The percentage of children and young adolescent population ranged from 6.4% to 16.5% with a median of 11.3%. In addition, the monthly income from the main employment of the working population, excluding unpaid family workers, ranged from HKD$9,000 to HKD$50,000 with a median of HKD$14,700. Additionally, the labor force participation rate ranged from 48.7% and 71.9% with a median of 58.8%. Based on the median of all factors, we assigned TPUs with a percentage of senior population of &gt;=16.6% or a percentage of children and young adolescent population of &gt;= 11.3%, or a monthly income from main employment of &lt;=$14,700, or a labor force participation rate of &lt;= 58.8% in socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods, namely in “areas with a higher senior population”, “areas with a higher children and young adolescent population”, “areas with a higher lower income population”, and “areas with lower labor participation rate” (
