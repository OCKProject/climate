<p class="p">Finally, although areas with a lower labor participation rate had more greenspace and public open space than the general environment across Kowloon, the areas which increased in AWCET across these neighborhoods had less greenspace and public open space than the areas without increases in AWCET. It indicated that although such neighborhoods may be in good environmental quality, when extreme weather caused by climate change is more severe and frequent, less mitigation effort on areas with an increase in AWCET may ultimately result in thermal health issues for populations. In addition, higher percentages of road networks and average building density were not found in all socioeconomically deprived areas with increases in AWCET. This aligns with the results in the previous section, which stated that the actions of urban design might be applied across the city to reduce building density and road networks, in order to ultimately reduce thermal distress across the city.</p>
