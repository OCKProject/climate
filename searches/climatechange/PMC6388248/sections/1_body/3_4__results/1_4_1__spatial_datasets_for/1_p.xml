<p class="p">By fitting the training dataset of air temperature into a linear regression, predicted air temperature on the selected date with satellite overpass of the study year have shown a high correlation with the observed air temperature on the same day, in which RMSE is 0.73 °C and R

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00497-f002" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). These results are comparable with other similar studies, which RMSEs of previous studies can range from 1.3–3.5 °C, and R-squared ranged from 0.34 to 0.94 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00497-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>), the air temperature across districts are apparently increasing, while the wind speed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-00497-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>) is varying through years, possibly due to urban development and re-development, or regional impact. Therefore, it is necessary to combine both, mapping the relative increase of AWCET for determining the actual change in winter perceived temperature that potentially influences the city wellbeing.
