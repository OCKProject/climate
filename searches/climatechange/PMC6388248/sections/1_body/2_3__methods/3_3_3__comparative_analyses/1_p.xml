<p class="p">In order to conduct a comparative assessment, each perceived temperature map was subtracted by the AWCET at the location of the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarters for mapping the relative AWCET across the Kowloon Peninsula each year. The aim here was to evaluate the intensity of heat across districts based on a representative station and the method is commonly used in urban climatic studies [

These relative AWCET maps were further processed as follows: (1) we subtracted the relative AWCET maps of 1995, 2000, 2005 and 2010 by the winter perceived temperature maps demonstrating scenarios from past 5 years (e.g., a map of 1995 was subtracted by a map of 1990); and (2) we averaged all the relative subtracted maps for estimating the average increase of relative AWCET across Kowloon Peninsula. The resulting maps were then integrated with information on the urban environment: (1) for indicating whether current urban settings can induce/mitigate the potential increase of winter temperature, and (2) for identifying the community groups (e.g., senior populations, low income) that may suffer more thermal distress under the changing environment. The average relative AWCET for 20 years (1990â€“2010) was also mapped for evaluating whether spatial distributions between average AWCET and increase of AWCET are different. It was based on an assumption that the spatial distribution of average temperature commonly used for climatic mapping was significantly different from the distribution of the increase in AWCET, and therefore the latter one should be applied for sustainable urban planning in order to develop a set of solutions for climate change mitigation. This study also mapped both distributions based on the lands within the 1990 coastal boundary of Hong Kong, for a better and more accurate comparison of temperature changes within 20 years. Lands from reclamation after 1990 were not included in this analysis.
