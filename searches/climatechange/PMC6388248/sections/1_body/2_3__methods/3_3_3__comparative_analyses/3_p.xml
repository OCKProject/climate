 <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test analysis was applied to compare the difference in the mean of each urban environmental factor for areas with an increase of AWCET (&gt;0 °C) and areas without an increase (&lt;=0 °C) through the years. The 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>-test was firstly applied to compare the areas with an increase or without an increase of AWCET across the study site was applied to stratified areas with higher socioeconomic deprivation for further evaluation of the difference in the mean of areas with and without an increase of AWCET across the socioeconomically deprived area. The following are the socioeconomically deprived areas that have been analyzed in this study: (1) areas with higher percentage of senior population (age &gt;=65); (2) areas with higher percentage of children and young adolescent populations (age &lt;=14); (3) areas with lower median monthly income from main employment of working population, excluding unpaid family workers, and (4) areas with lower percentage of labor force participation rate. In detail, the medians of all tertiary planning units (TPUs) for the socioeconomic factors stated above were used as the cutoff for stratifying districts under the categories of (1) to (4).
