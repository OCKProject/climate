<p class="p">For the evaluation of the relationship between current urban environments and increased winter perceived temperature, we further converted the map of average relative increases of AWCET to a vector-based point format in order to represent information of each location at a 30 m resolution across Kowloon. Four groups of variables were created for data comparison: (1) green coverage; (2) public open space; (3) road network, and (4) building density, in which more of items (1) and (2) and less of (3) and (4) have been identified as keys for climate change mitigation through urban planning [

 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. In brief, data of green coverage were derived from the vegetation map based on the focal statistics function of ArcGIS, and the derived data indicated the percentage of green coverage within radii of 100 m, 200 m, 300 m, 400 m, and 500 m, respectively. Public open spaces and road networks were retrieved from the “open space” and “road” GIS-based land use data, and these data subsets were also spatially averaged by focal statistics for estimating the percentage of public open spaces or road networks within a radii of 100 m, 200 m, 300 m, 400 m, and 500 m. Building density was demonstrated by SVF, where higher SVF indicated lower building density and lower SVF indicated higher building density [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. These data were also spatially averaged by focal statistics as stated above. All data for comparison were extracted by all points across the study area in representing the environmental factors at 30 m interval.
