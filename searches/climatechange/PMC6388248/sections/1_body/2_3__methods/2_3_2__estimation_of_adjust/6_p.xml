<p class="p">Wind velocity across the Kowloon Peninsula was estimated based on the Airflow Analyst
 <sup class="sup">Â®</sup>, as an extension plugin of ArcGIS. This model can incorporate spatial data for simulating ventilation and air movements across a complex landscape. The algorithm was based on a 3-dimensional computed fluid dynamics (CFD) model, and has been validated in various studies for predicting wind speed in different urban and rural environments [

 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. In this study, the DEM and 3D building datasets for 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 were inputted to simulate the wind velocity across the Kowloon Peninsula. Based on the daily average of wind information retrieved from the Star Ferry Automatic Wind Station on the representative dates of each study year, five sets of data corresponding to each 3D scenario of each study year were generated. These 3D scenarios were then applied to subsequent fluid analysis at an average surface height of 1.5 m. Results were exported as 2D raster maps of each year at 10 m spatial resolution for illustrating wind velocity under the influence of urban sprawl and morphology.
