<p class="p">For estimating the AWCET, air temperature maps were resampled to 10 m resolution with the same resolution as wind velocity data. Based on the resampled air temperature dataset and wind velocity map of each year, this study applied the equation stated above to map the AWCET across the Kowloon Peninsula for the year of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010.</p>
