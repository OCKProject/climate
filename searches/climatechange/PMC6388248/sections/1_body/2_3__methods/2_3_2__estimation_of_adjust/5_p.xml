<p class="p">The spatial distribution of air temperature of each year was estimated based on the land surface temperature (LST) dataset derived from Landsat 5 images and air temperature records obtained from all the government-based weather stations stated above. Details of the LST retrieval used in this study can be referred to in reference [

In brief, this is an advanced urban exitance model designated for retrieving LST with a relatively high spatial resolution (30 m) in a compact city, with considerations of the urban geometric effects and material emissivity. Although some research has shown complex relationships between LST and air temperature [

 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], a previous study in Hong Kong found that using linear regression for the Kowloon Peninsula is still appropriate [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], as this area is mostly urbanized and relatively flat. Lower spatial variation across urban areas has less influence on the temporal variation of daily air temperature, similar to other studies that have used LST images with linear regression to predict the daily average temperature in a spatially homogenous area. Therefore, eighteen Landsat 5 images acquired in the winters between 2006 and 2011, and the daily average of air temperature records on the overpass date of satellites, were firstly used to develop a training set of the prediction model. LST datasets selected as representative of the year were then fitted into the prediction model. It is noted that the selected LST dataset for 2010 was not included in the training data and was used for validation purposes instead. The deliverables were five different maps at 30 m resolution showing air temperature distribution across Kowloon Peninsula in the year of 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010. These results were then compared with the daily average air temperature retrieved from the five weather stations on the same day for validation. Root-mean-square error (RMSE) and R-Squared (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) were used to determine the accuracy of air temperature prediction by LST products.
