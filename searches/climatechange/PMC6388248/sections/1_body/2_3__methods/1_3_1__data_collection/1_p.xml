These stations were representatives of the urban environments of Hong Kong, and were suitable for mapping air temperatures across the high-environment environments of the Kowloon Peninsula. In addition, wind information for modelling was obtained from the Star Ferry Automatic Wind Station in the southwestern corner of Peninsula and wind data for validation was obtained from the weather station located at the King’s Park and the Hong Kong Observatory Headquarter.
