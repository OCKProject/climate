<p class="p">Twenty-three Landsat 5 multispectral images between 1990 and 2011 were obtained from the USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis), including 18 images between 2006 and 2011, as training data for air temperature prediction, and 5 additional images as representatives of typical winter days during 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010 (

 <xref rid="ijerph-16-00497-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). These data were selected due to their availability and lack of cloud contamination over the study area. A series of digital surface model (DSM) with 2 m spatial resolution and three-dimensional (3D) building datasets were retrieved from stereoscopic photogrammetry of aerial photographs for years 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010 [
