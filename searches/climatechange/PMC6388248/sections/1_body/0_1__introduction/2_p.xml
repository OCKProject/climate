<p class="p">Researchers have developed indices from apparent temperature to represent perceived temperature. For example, humidex and the heat stress index have been applied to describe thermal distress from citizens during extreme weather events [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, the data used for such studies were always acquired by mobile or vehicular transverse observations. Further improvements in mapping perceived temperature have been undertaken by incorporating satellite images for spatial and temporal monitoring of thermal stress. Satellite-based predicted maps are highly accurate and can provide a synoptic view of a city without extensive field measurements [
