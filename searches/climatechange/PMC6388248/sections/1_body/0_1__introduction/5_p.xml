<p class="p">Based on these hypotheses, here we present a study which provides a first attempt of using spatiotemporal information of winter perceived temperature for improving the urban design for the climate resilience of a subtropical city. The specific objectives of this study are: (1) to estimate the average increase in winter perceived temperature in five-year intervals based on 20â€“year data between 1990 and 2010; (2) to compare the areas with an increase/decrease in winter perceived temperatures with urban environmental factors of the same locations; (3) to pinpoint the hot-spot areas which require immediate improvements in urban design; (4) to further pinpoint the hot-spot areas based on the identification of different socioeconomic deprived neighborhoods; (5) and to highlight key factors for future urban planning. A case study for planning application was applied to the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong, a well-known high-density environment in a compact city with mixed land use and a large population across a relatively small geographic extent [
