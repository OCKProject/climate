<p class="p">Under the influence of climate change, global temperature will rapidly increase in the coming decades [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This may result in a decreased of number of normal winter days, especially in cities within the sub-tropical region. However, there have been studies indicating that global warming cannot minimize the adverse health effect of extremely cold days, and high mortality/morbidity risks can still be observed during extremely cold days in sub-tropical cities [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. This is because the health burden of extreme cold events is mainly from sudden decreases in temperature. In a city with more relatively hot days during winter, an extreme cold event can be a fatal disaster due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness of local people. Therefore, it is necessary to develop further planning for climate change mitigation for local populations. Specifically, the key for the mitigation of climate change should include the improvement of the urban resilience of a city [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and the way to do this is by the further enhancement of sustainable planning. Based on this view, the strategy of mitigating such extreme weather should be based on normalizing the temperature across a sub-tropical city to a winter-like scenario, in order to develop a nature-based solution that can improve climate change adaptation of local population.
