<p class="p">In order to better develop a comprehensive protocol for sustainable planning and for climate change mitigation in cities with less normal winter days, one solution will be an integration of winter perceived temperature in the prediction modelling. Particularly, a spatiotemporal component that can represent the increase of winter temperature through the years should be incorporated, since this strategy can improve planning guidelines to reduce human thermal discomfort in all-seasons under the impact of climate change. It is also essential to pinpoint an urban area with inner-city decay, in which the planning protocols can be implemented as sustainable development during urban renewal. In addition, such planning protocols should also be incorporated with socioeconomic data for modeling. There are also extensive studies that aim to identify socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods for planning, and these have worked with temperature maps as well as with the data on socioeconomic deprivation in order to identify the risk spots for climate change mitigation [
