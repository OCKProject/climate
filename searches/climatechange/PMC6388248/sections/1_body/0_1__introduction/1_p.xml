<p class="p">Thermal distress is an issue contributing to negative wellbeing across cities [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Numerous studies have indicated that perceived temperature is a key part of inducing thermal distress and is partially controlled by urban built environments [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. During a heat wave, the urban population in a city with a poorly designed built environment can suffer intensive thermal distress, and this thermal distress may even lead to thermal health issues in extreme cases [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-16-00497" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Therefore, prediction of perceived temperature for monitoring thermal distress is the key to the wellbeing of urban populations in climate change mitigation [
