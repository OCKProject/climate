<p class="p">Spatiotemporal variation in relative winter perceived temperatures across a high-density environment have been modeled, with a comparison of urban characteristics in different socioeconomically deprived neighborhoods for city planning. Results have shown that areas with increases in relative temperature may generally be the districts with less greenspace and public open space across high-density environments in recent years, but this can be varied in socioeconomically deprived districts. In addition, not all recognized factors of socioeconomic deprivation are associated with districts that have recent urban design with less efficiency for climate change mitigation. The results imply that further planning should have multi-level assessments of environmental impacts in order to develop protocols for climate change mitigations that can be both beneficial to the general population and to specific vulnerable populations.</p>
