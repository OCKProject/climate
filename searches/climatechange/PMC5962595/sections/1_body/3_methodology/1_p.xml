 <italic class="italic">ClimGen</italic> allows a geographical allocation of projected isotherms, enabling the calculation of spatial and temporal variability of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> and its scenario-induced uncertainties (see Extended Data). Monthly temperature projections were generated for the period of 2040 to 2099 using 0.5 × 0.5 degree grid resolution, which is the highest resolution for contemporary GCMs. They were interpolated into a global temperature high-resolution raster surface dataset, using the Natural Neighbour interpolation method (ArcGIS v. 10.4 Spatial Analyst toolset). To attenuate annual variations, the monthly values of five consecutive years were separately averaged (e.g. January 2040–2044). Since no daily resolution was given, the months with average values &gt;5 °C were used to calculate daily GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> averages using days-per-month multipliers. Finally, these calculated daily values of each 5-year period were summarized to obtain annual GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> values for agricultural projections
