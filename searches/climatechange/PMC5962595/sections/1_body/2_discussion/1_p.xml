<p id="Par8" class="p">All simulations consistently showed a geographical upward shift of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas, despite inter-model differences. The projections were particularly different at the northernmost latitudes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). These differences can be explained by the following: (i) the models were developed based on distinct assumptions regarding ocean currents, interactions between ocean surface and the atmosphere at the boundary layer, and the role and mixing of melting ice, among others

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>
 </sup> and (ii) the focus of the models is different. For example, the ipsl_cm4 (France) model projected the greatest GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> changes, for every time step and latitude, whereas csiro_mk30 (Australia) projected the smallest changes. In this case, ipsl_cm4 was calibrated with a focus on the North Atlantic and tropical currents in the northern hemisphere

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup> was developed and calibrated with a stronger oceanic focus. However, despite inter-model differences in total areas, all trends were uniformly upwards, justifying the use of an inter-model averaging approach

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup>. Moreover, the inter-model error, as described by the coefficient of variance, decreased over time (Extended Data Fig.
