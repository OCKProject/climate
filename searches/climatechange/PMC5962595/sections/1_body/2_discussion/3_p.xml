 </sup>. However, annualised predictions are not adequate for crop management decisions, which are based on seasonal variability in water availability. Our description of the variability of climatic water balances within the growing season indicated that an increase in annual total precipitation does not necessarily mean more water available to crops. Critically, our projections show only marginal gains in precipitation during the growing season, while the projected increase in PET will affect the feasibility of rain-fed cropping for large parts of the newly gained GDD

In comparison, current irrigation needs for yield maximization in northern Europe vary between 0 and 250 mm, with most regions requiring at least some supplemental irrigation

In contrast, boreal regions around the Pacific and Atlantic rims, such as Norway, Atlantic and Pacific Canada, are expected to receive more precipitation and will have larger climatic water surpluses during the growing season, despite an increase in PET. This could be a favourable scenario but may also require substantial investment in agricultural erosion and drainage control measures.
