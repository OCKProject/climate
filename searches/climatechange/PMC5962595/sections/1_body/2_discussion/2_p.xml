However, the temporal variation in the expansion may complicate short-term agricultural development and management planning and practices; inner-continental regions are more likely to undergo a non-linear change in GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areal expansion, with regular cooling and warming cycles. Such patterns suggest the importance of both, short-term and long-term planning and thus the need for locally relevant approaches to any proposal for an expansion in agricultural land.
