<p id="Par7" class="p">A comparison of the current and projected growing season precipitation (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6A</xref>) showed that the spatial pattern remained relatively stable, with future precipitation being slightly higher. Contrary to the relatively stable future precipitation pattern, the climate change associated temperature increase leads to much higher PET across the boreal regions, mostly doubling current PET values (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5B</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6B</xref>). This will result in more complex, regionalized climatic water surplus and deficit conditions (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5C</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6C</xref>). The highest deficits, resulting from low precipitation and larger PET values, were projected for the central continental regions both of North America and Eurasia. Approximately 60% of the newly gained GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area in the Eurasian boreal region would experience climatic water deficits during the growing season from May to October (i.e. &gt;300 mm deficit; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6C</xref> and Extended Data Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>-century. A similar scenario was projected for the North American boreal region, where 40% of the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area might suffer &gt;300 mm climatic water deficits. Changes in the climatic water balances are expected to be particularly high for large parts of Ontario and Manitoba (Canada) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6D</xref>). Our detailed spatial and temporal projections, however, indicate that most of the deficits are likely occur for short periods in the summer only and might not meet the recently proposed aridification threshold of &lt;0.65

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref> and

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>). While for the newly gained GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas in Norway a surplus of climatic water balance is projected, Sweden, and Finland will likely have deficit of climatic water balance during the growing season. The fall months (September and October), in particular, were found to be associated with climatic water surpluses (Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>), even for some regions where an overall climatic water deficit was projected for the growing season.
