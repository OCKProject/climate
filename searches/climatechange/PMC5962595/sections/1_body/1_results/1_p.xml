 </sup> of seven GCMs with equal weighting, consistently suggested that GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas will expand northward to eventually cover an average of three-quarters of the boreal regions by 2099 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Although temporally and spatially non-linear, the trend is consistent across longitudes. The leading edges of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas in the eastern part of North America, northwest Russia, Finland, and western Asia were found to shift northward by 400 to 600 km by 2099 (Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). A greater linear northward shift was projected for the western parts of North America, with &gt;850 km in places by 2069, and as much as 932 km (Alberta, Canada) by 2099. For large areas of East Asia, a northward shift of up to 1000 km was projected by 2055, reaching nearly 1200 km by 2099 for eastern Siberia (Russian Federation). Notably, the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 regions along prominent mountain ranges (outside and inside the boreal regions), such as in the Himalayas, the Urals, and the Rockies, remained comparatively stable (Fig.
