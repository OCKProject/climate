<p id="Par6" class="p">Importantly, most projected increases occur in regions that have a different photoperiod profile from current agricultural regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>). In Eurasia, the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area increase within the 65° to 69°N region is projected to be almost twice as large as the new areas projected for all other latitudes. Currently, only 11.6% of the Eurasian and 0.2% of the North American boreal regions above the 54°N parallel have a GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> above 1200 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Of the total expansion of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area, increases from 57.6% [mpi_echam5] to 71.7% [csiro-mk30] for Eurasia, and from 39.5% [mpi_echam5] to 52.1% [csiro-mk30] for North America were projected for the 55° to 69°N region. However, the largest model deviations were estimated for the highest latitudes (i.e. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, Extended Data Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>) as already suggested by the prediction ranges for Scandinavian countries. For example, from 5.2% to 20.8% (mpi_echam5 or csiro-mk30, respectively) of the total Eurasian expansion and from 3.3% to 7.4% (mpi_echam5 or ipsl_cm4, respectively) of the North American expansion is projected for very high latitude regions, above 70°N. The boreal regions currently extend further south in Eurasia than that in North America, and consequently, the predicted temperature shift will result in large areas of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 in Eurasia within the 30 to 54°N region (from 17.6% [ukmo_hadgem1] to 24.6% [ccma_cgcm31]). In North America, given the current more northerly distribution of GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub>, only about 5.3% to 9.4% (ipsl_cm4 and csiro_cm4, respectively) of the total expansion for the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 is projected to occur in the boreal regions below 54°N.
