<p id="Par5" class="p">For certain countries, the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas may rapidly occupy a large proportion of their boreal regions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For example, by 2055 the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area within the boreal region was found to increase in Kyrgyzstan from the current 38% to 91%, in Sweden from 8% to 41%, and in Finland from 51% to 83%. The projected proportional gain was particularly high for the Scandinavian countries. By the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>-century, the area with GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 was demonstrated to expand by approximately 687% in Sweden (374% to 1027%), 326% in Norway (107% to 704%), and 178% in Canada (97% to 255%). Projections for these countries, however, also had the greatest uncertainties, in part due to the dominantly cross-latitudinal orientation of their territories. The largest absolute increases in the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>-century emerged in the Russian Federation (5.12·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), Canada (3.07·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) and the USA, mainly in Alaska (0.57·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). The other boreal countries were projected to experience a total absolute increase of &lt;0.8·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, but which is still relevant for regional land-use planning. Overall, the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 areas of boreal regions may expand by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>-century by about 140% (72% to 180%), which equals an area of 9.55·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. For Iceland, which covers 0.10·10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, or 0.5% of the global boreal area, the simulations suggested that it would not be affected; only one of the seven models, ukmo_hadcm3, suggested an expansion of the GDD
 <sub class="sub">5</sub> ≥ 1200 area, which would cover 15% of Iceland’s boreal area by the end of the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup>-century; this is 0.09% of the total gain within the global boreal region.
