 <p class="p">Women in science face barriers to professional advancement. One of the most important forums for international climate science is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, where there has been a slow increase in the proportion of women authors since the first assessment in 1990. Our survey of more than 100 female Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change authors explores their experience and perceptions, the barriers to their full participation that they identify, and recommendations for improvements. While we find that some women reported a positive experience, others felt women were poorly represented and heard and encountered barriers beyond their gender including race, nationality, command of English, and discipline. The study contributes to the larger literature on gender and science and provides recommendations for greater inclusion.</p>
