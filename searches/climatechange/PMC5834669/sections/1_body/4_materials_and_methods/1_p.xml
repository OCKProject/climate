<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">All methods and materials were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the University of Arizona. Participants were presented in writing with the same information required in a written consent document, but signing of the consent form was waived by the IRB. The research involves no more than minimal risk of harm to subjects and involves no procedures for which written consent is normally required. Our goal was to survey as many women as we could identify who had been a coordinating lead author or lead author of an IPCC report. We chose to survey only women because we were interested in their experiences and views rather than a comparison with men. Identifying female IPCC authors is challenging because the first two assessments identified authors only by their initials and did not distinguish lead authorship. Some women could not be located. After undertaking a pilot survey and removing duplicates of women who served in multiple roles and reports, we contacted 223 individuals by email asking if they would complete a web survey. A total of 111 responded to some questions, and 98 completed the full survey—a response rate of 44%. We asked both closed and open questions to understand (

 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) views of the IPCC author experience and impact on her professional career, (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) perception of barriers to their participation and voice and those of other women, and (
 <italic class="italic">iv</italic>) recommendations to improve women’s participation in the IPCC. We report both quantitative and qualitative results with illustrative quotations to give voice to our respondents.
