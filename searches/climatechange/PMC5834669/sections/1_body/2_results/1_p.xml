<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">In terms of trends in IPCC female participation, our best estimate is that the first assessment in 1990 had no more than a dozen female authors and contributors, constituting 2% of the total scientists involved. The number and proportion of women authors rose over time from 26 (5% of all lead authors) in the 1997 second assessment to almost 100 in the 2001 fourth report (21%) and 182 (22%) in the fifth and most recent report in 2013. The most powerful positions in IPCC are those of chair or vice-chair of a working group. Only three women have ever filled these roles until the most recent election for the sixth assessment in which eight women are now in executive roles (of 32). Women have had slightly more representation within the technical support units and task forces that sustain IPCC.</p>
