 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Women noted that if they had children, childcare responsibilities were their biggest obstacle, particularly those who were single parents or with babies. Several confessed that this responsibility might have negatively impacted their performance during the IPCC; as one noted, “I was a single parent during the last IPCC cycle, so traveling was a major obstacle. I managed because I really wanted to do this, but it was a large extra hurdle that caused me to arrive stressed at meetings and sometimes to not have full attention.”
