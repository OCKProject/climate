<p class="p">We asked scientists whether gender, race, ethnicity, language, youth, and nationality were barriers to their and other women’s full participation in the IPCC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Respondents saw few barriers to their own participation but reported problems for others. Fourteen percent saw their gender and 14% saw their command of English as barriers; 9% reported their race/ethnicity to be barriers. For example, one woman wrote “my responses for ‘others’ . . . are only a guess at some of the difficulties that I think that some of the developing country representatives must have.” Seventy-five percent saw lack of English ability as a barrier for others, 37.5% saw gender as a barrier for others, and 28% perceived a barrier for others associated with race. The open-ended responses were numerous in identifying women from developing countries as marginalized.
