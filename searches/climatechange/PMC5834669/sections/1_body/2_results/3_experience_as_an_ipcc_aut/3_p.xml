<p class="p">The open-ended responses, where women could provide more detail on their experiences, were less positive. For example, several felt that more work was required from women than from men, but without appropriate credit. Others reported feeling marginalized and ignored: “I felt that IPCC scientists are in small impenetrable groups. . . . I didn’t feel welcome” and found “the IPCC process to be male dominated . . . by the older established men.” Other respondents wrote that “there was no equal opportunity to contribute . . . decisions were unilateral, nontransparent, a few scientists controlled the write-up” and “the leadership . . . [was] rather arrogant and not very inclusive. He only seemed to be interested in your opinion if you were an Ivy League-tenured, white male professor. In particular, researchers from developing countries felt excluded by him.” Another respondent told us that it seemed as if “some people’s views seemed more important than others, making information from some regions more important than others . . . rendering the whole exercise a big lie . . . it is a pity.” Some had different experiences over several assessments and received support from fellow authors: “there was one author of my chapter who occasionally did not treat me respectfully. He was arrogant and dismissive, but I prevailed through persistence and taking him on directly both inside meetings and in chapter meetings. My co-authors were also aligned with me, so I had their support.”</p>
