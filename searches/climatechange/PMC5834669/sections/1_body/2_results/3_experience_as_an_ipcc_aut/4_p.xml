<p class="p">Women reporting positive experiences mentioned an overall inclusive, safe, and respectful atmosphere where they felt listened to and could make important contributions: “My chapter team were great people, we had really good discussions and a lot of fun. We all treated each other with respect. Most of us worked very hard. While there was one male in our group who talked a lot, the CLA would always make sure I got to make my point, and he often backed me up in discussions. . . . I always felt that my views were considered and I was listened to. We achieved balance across the literature, and distilled it, just as the IPCC should . . . there was a pleasant camaraderie and a mutual understanding of the different personalities in the group. In short, one of the best team efforts I have ever known!” Other women told us “I met extraordinary people, I strengthened my (belief) in responsibility and teamwork” and “I was in a chapter with a lot of senior female scientists which . . . made it easier for the younger and less experienced.”</p>
