<p class="p">Subtler discrimination was reported when women recognized that gender must have been a barrier in their career as scientists but were unsure of how or when it happened. For example: “I suspect that gender has delayed my career, it’s hard to say exactly how, but probably through lack of mentoring, not being ‘seen.’ . . . I now have a full professorship, but I still feel that a male of the same standing might be more likely to be picked for a leadership role than I would.” Another woman wrote “in my view being a female scientist is never neutral. Mostly it is detrimental, people do not take you seriously when you speak. . . . Rarely do I feel just ‘normal,’ only with very close colleagues.” Some attributed their success to good luck because they saw many of their female colleagues’ struggle. One expressed the following: “While I have been lucky in my career opportunities, I see many of my female peers dropping out along the way due to lack of job security and flexibility, which impacts females more than males.”</p>
