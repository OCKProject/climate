<p class="p">Active discrimination occurs when women are not included, silenced, ignored, not supported, or not given the credit that they deserved because they are female. As a respondent noted, “There are enough female scientists that are capable of contributing …[but] males promote other males. It is a fact that there are many male scientists in IPCC that discriminate against female scientists based on the simple fact that they are women.” Another told us “women are still not listened to as much in committees. Many times, a male colleague repeated what I’d just said, and it was then tagged in the future as (his) idea rather than mine.”</p>
