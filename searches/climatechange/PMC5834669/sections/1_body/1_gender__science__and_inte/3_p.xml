<p class="p">An intersectional approach has been used to understand how multiple roles and identities contribute to vulnerability to climate impacts. Characteristics such as gender, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, nationality, health, sexual orientation, age, and place can disadvantage or empower in experiencing and responding to climate change and environmental problems (

A few studies have found low percentages (less than 15%) of women studying atmospheric sciences in the past few decades, and several surveys find that women see family responsibilities, isolation, and discrimination as obstacles to their careers. Women climate scientists identify with a range of disciplines, especially geoscience, meteorology, ecology, and physical geography and likely share the interests, barriers, and opportunities facing women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics more generally (

Those working across the natural and social sciences to study climate impacts and policy include geographers as well women from anthropology, economics, international relations, and law. Within universities worldwide, women tend to be better represented in social than in natural sciences (
