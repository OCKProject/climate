However, incremental changes in traditional cropping systems have achieved only limited success in meeting these multiple challenges. In this study, we applied a systematic approach, using model simulation and data from two groups of field studies conducted in the North China Plain, to develop a new cropping system that improves yield and uses water in a sustainable manner. Due to significant warming, we identified a double-maize (M-M; <italic>Zea mays</italic> L.) cropping system that replaced the traditional winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) &#x02013;summer maize system. The M-M system improved yield by 14&#x02013;31% compared with the conventionally managed wheat-maize system, and achieved similar yield compared with the incrementally adapted wheat-maize system with the optimized cultivars, planting dates, planting density and water management. More importantly, water usage was lower in the M-M system than in the wheat-maize system, and the rate of water usage was sustainable (net groundwater usage was &#x02264;150&#x02009;mm yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Our study indicated that systematic assessment of adaptation and cropping system scale have great potential to address the multiple food supply challenges under changing climatic conditions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Agriculture faces rapidly growing challenges because it must supply food to an increasing population under shifting climate conditions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>.

To cope with these multiple challenges, researchers, policy makers, and farmers urgently need to consider different levels of agricultural adaptation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p><p>To counteract the negative effects of climate change, researchers have generally emphasized incremental adaptation to existing cropping systems, such as the adjustment of planting dates and the use of cultivars with longer growing periods<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Although these adaptations might indeed be effective in terms of improved grain yield, a growing sensitivity of crop production to water shortages has also been observed<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>. Considering the potential for further reductions in water availability for agriculture<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>, such incremental adjustments are unlikely to provide long-term solutions to the problems of inadequate food and water supplies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. Thus, more extensive changes in cropping systems should be considered.</p><p>The North China Plain (NCP), which is facing significant warming and water scarcity, has received worldwide attention<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. The NCP provides more than one-fourth of the national food supply in China<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. The dominant agricultural system in this region involves double cropping. Winter wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) is rotated with summer maize (<italic>Zea mays</italic> L.), resulting in two harvests annually<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. To adapt for the changing climate, researchers have adjusted planting and harvesting dates, and identified cultivars that require more days to maturity, to improve grain yield<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>. However, because of the large gap between precipitation and water demand in the winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system, such adaption requires more than 250&#x02009;mm groundwater for irrigation each year, even when water usage is optimized<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. As a consequence, the groundwater table in the northern part of the NCP has declined by about 1&#x02009;m&#x02009;yr<sup>&#x02212;1&#x02009;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>. This decline has caused a series of environmental problems and has restricted sustainable development in the region<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. It is now clear that incremental adaptation of planting dates and crop cultivars is inadequate in this region. Rather than small adjustments to the current cropping system, more systematic changes are now required to meet the challenges of global warming, water scarcity, and a growing demand for food.</p><p>Although climate warming poses serious problems for agriculture, it also enables the usage of new cropping systems because of increased available growing degree days (GDD), which are a measure of heat accumulation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. Reports from some studies have described the possibility of using new cropping systems in response to global warming. For example, warming might allow irrigated maize in central Chile to increase from a single crop to a double crop annually in future climate scenarios<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. Although this type of cropping system change could be important, it has received only limited theoretical attention and has seldom been tested experimentally.</p><p>In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a new cropping system would increase yield and reduce water usage relative to the traditional winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system in the NCP. Maize, a C<sub>4</sub> crop, could efficiently use water and solar radiation to achieve remarkably high and stable grain yields<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Therefore, we attempted to develop a new double-maize (M-M) system (with two maize crops annually) to replace the traditional winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system (with one C<sub>3</sub> and one C<sub>4</sub> crop annually) at the site of Quzhou in the NCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). To design the new system, we used the Hybrid-Maize model and historical climate data. We then evaluated different combinations of two seasons&#x02019; cultivars in terms of grain yield and water usage to establish the new system in a 2-year field experiment.</p><p>Finally, we conducted an experiment to compare the new M-M system with the conventional winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize (Con.W-M) system, and the optimized winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize (Opt.W-M) system with incremental adaptation over 2 years. We attempted to answer three questions: (1) Given the recent climate changes, could maize be double cropped each year in the NCP? (2) If the answer is &#x0201c;yes,&#x0201d; how should the M-M system be designed? and (3) How does the new M-M system perform compared with the winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system, with respect to grain yield and water usage?</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Climatic trends and design of the double-maize system</title><p>From 1981 to 2010, Quzhou experienced significant warming. The mean temperature (T<sub>mean</sub>) increased by 0.64&#x02009;&#x000b0;C decade<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. The minimum temperature (T<sub>min</sub>) increased by 0.94&#x02009;&#x000b0;C decade<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), while the maximum temperature (T<sub>max</sub>) did not change significantly. As a result, the annual GDD in the frost-free period increased significantly, by 12.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Meanwhile, average length of the frost-free period increased by 1.3 days annually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref>). The annual precipitation did not change significantly, and averaged 502&#x02009;mm from 1981 to 2010 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1d</xref>).</p><p>To test the feasibility of using the M-M system under conditions of significant warming, we used the Hybrid-Maize model and climate data from the recent decade (2001&#x02013;2010) to simulate maize growth. We used the four combinations of long-season (LS) and short-season (SS) maize cultivars (SS-SS, SS-LS, LS-SS, and LS-LS; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). Yield potential simulated by the Hybrid-Maize model was more than 19.0&#x02009;Mg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the first three treatments (SS-SS, SS-LS, and LS-SS). Yield potential was less than 19.0&#x02009;Mg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the LS-LS treatment, due to the severe risk of frost at the end of the summer maize season. The overall probability of frost occurrence during grain filling in the second season was 100% for all treatments except the SS-SS treatment.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Grain yield and temporal match between maize growth and accumulation of growing degree days in field experiment I: double-maize system establishment</title><p>In field experiment I, grain yield was highest for the SS-LS treatment and similar among the other three treatments in 2012 and 2013 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Grain yield of the SS-LS treatment was 20.3&#x02009;Mg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2012 and 17.5&#x02009;Mg ha<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in 2013, which were 25&#x02013;32% and 22&#x02013;25% higher, respectively, than the yields of the other three treatments. The ratio between yield and yield potential ranged from 69% to 93% (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Among the four treatments, the highest proportion of the yield potential was achieved in the SS-LS treatment in 2012 (93%) and 2013 (88%), respectively. For all treatments, the ratio between yield and yield potential was higher for spring maize than for summer maize. The SS-LS treatment showed the greatest potential for wide demonstration to farmers, due to the higher grain yield and achievement of yield potential.</p><p>In 2012, the spring maize yield was similar among all four treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), but the summer maize yield was 91&#x02013;129% higher for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments. The ability of the SS-LS treatment to achieve the highest grain yield could be explained, in part, by the temporal match between maize growth and GDD accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The SS cultivar increased the time available for summer maize, and the LS cultivar, when grown as summer maize, could grow longer before the onset of lower temperatures. In 2012, the summer maize growing season was 16 days longer for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). For the SS-LS treatment, GDD accumulated slowly during the reproductive stage of summer maize, and the T<sub>mean</sub> was 18.2&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, which was suitable for grain filling. As a result, the reproductive stage for summer maize was 4&#x02013;30 days longer for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments. In 2013, the SS-LS treatment achieved a high grain yield, also mainly from summer maize (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), and the summer maize season was 19&#x02013;31 days longer for this treatment than for the other treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>).</p><p>The high grain yield of the SS-LS treatment also resulted from tolerance of the cultivars to environmental stresses. When the SS cultivar Deimeiya 1 (DMY1) was planted as spring maize, it achieved 100% of its yield potential (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). In contrast, the SS cultivar performed poorly when it was planted as summer maize in the SS-SS and LS-SS treatments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), mainly because this high-latitude cultivar could not tolerate the hot and wet summers in the NCP. For the LS-LS treatment, severe frost required harvest of summer maize before maturity, which reduced grain yield.</p><p>For all treatments, the annual yields were lower in 2013 than in 2012, due mainly to lower spring maize yields. These low yields were attributable to the occurrence of more days with rain and less solar radiation during the spring of 2013 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Irrigation, water use efficiency, and water balance in field experiment I: double-maize system establishment</title><p>For all treatments, total irrigation in 2012 was 140&#x02009;mm, which was used entirely for the spring maize crop (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3">Table 3</xref>). In 2013, total irrigation was 240&#x02009;mm, of which 150&#x02009;mm was used for the spring maize crop and 90&#x02009;mm was used for the summer maize crop. Irrigation differed between the years because the precipitation differed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).

Our findings suggest that the new M-M system could achieve high productivity with sustainable water usage.</p><p>In contrast to the extensive adaptations presented in the current study, most previous adaptations of cropping systems in response to climate warming and water scarcity have been incremental<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>. For example, a typical incremental adaptation to climate change in the NCP is to adjust wheat planting and maize harvesting, and to grow LS maize cultivars. Over the last 40 years, this incremental adaptation has increased annual grain yield in the NCP by 4&#x02013;6%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Although this is an adaptation to adverse weather, it fails to reduce water usage (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>). Because of the large gap between precipitation and water demand, the traditional system consumes more than 200&#x02009;mm groundwater annually in farmers&#x02019; fields (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>To reduce the demand for water in the NCP, several research teams have attempted to develop new, lower-intensity cropping systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>. For example, a 6-year field study showed that systems with winter wheat and summer maize in the first year and spring maize alone (maize monoculture) in the second year could substantially reduce irrigation and groundwater usage in the NCP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>. However, grain yields of these systems with increased fallow periods were 16&#x02013;31% lower than the yield of the traditional winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system.</p><p>The higher grain yield in our M-M system compared with the conventional system could be explained, in part, by the cultivation of two, rather than one, C<sub>4</sub> crops annually. Maize more effectively uses solar radiation and other resources, and, thus has a higher yield potential, than a C<sub>3</sub> crop such as wheat. Higher grain yield in the new system could also be explained by the temporal match between maize growth and available resources, including GDD and light. For the new system, yield was higher for the SS-LS treatment than for the other three treatments in experiment I in 2012 and 2013, due to the short duration of the SS cultivar, as spring maize provided a long and optimal growing environment for summer maize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). The higher grain yield in the new system could also be explained by the tolerance of the cultivars to sources of stress in the hot and wet environment of the NCP during the summer. The SS cultivar DMY1, which was bred at high latitudes, is adapted to cool temperatures and performs well in the spring, but not in the summer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>). Other studies have shown that SS cultivars are useful for dealing with the increased risk of drought, which is often associated with climate change<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>. The development of cultivars that are tolerant to the abiotic and biotic stresses likely to be encountered with climate change in specific regions would be useful<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>.</p><p>The M-M system reduced irrigation, increased WUE, and reduced groundwater consumption, which could also be explained by growing two, rather than one, C<sub>4</sub> crops (maize) annually. WUE is known to be greater for C<sub>4</sub> cereals than for C<sub>3</sub> cereals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In addition, the demand for water and the occurrence of precipitation coincided temporally in the new system (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>). More than 90% of precipitation occurred during the maize growth period in the M-M system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The annual water requirements for the M-M system in experiment II were 589&#x02009;mm in 2013 and 585&#x02009;mm in 2014 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>). Thus, the gaps between water supplied by precipitation and water demand by the M-M system were 155&#x02009;mm in 2013 and 214&#x02009;mm in 2014.</p><p>Accounting for recharge through irrigation and precipitation, net annual groundwater consumption for the M-M system averaged 139&#x02009;mm. However, precipitation (434&#x02009;mm) was 68&#x02009;mm lower in 2013 and 131&#x02009;mm lower in 2014 than the 30-year average from 1981 to 2010. When we use the 30-year average rather than the 2-year average in our calculations, estimated groundwater consumption is less than 139&#x02009;mm. For the traditional winter wheat&#x02013;summer maize system, in contrast, only 20&#x02013;30% of the total precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growing season (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4">Table 4</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. To achieve a high grain yield of wheat, more than 400&#x02009;mm yr<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> supplementary irrigation is usually applied in some areas of the NCP<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we used plastic film to increase the total available GDD in the spring maize season for the M-M system. Plastic film also could influence the soil-crop water process by changing the balance between evaporation and transpiration, especially during the early maize growth stages. For example, some studies have shown that plastic film reduced soil evaporation by 60&#x02013;80&#x02009;mm<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. However, total ET during the whole maize season did not change significantly because of the increased transpiration under plastic film condition with larger biomass<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Plastic film could effectively reduce soil evaporation by creating an impermeable barrier, increasing canopy transpiration and thereby enhancing grain yield and WUE<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Our M-M system, as a systematic adaptation, involved not only biological understanding together with crop modeling (i.e., regarding cultivars and planting dates used), but also novel management techniques (e.g., used of plastic film, water management).</p><p>In the NCP, the warming trend is predicted to continue<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> and water scarcity could become more severe<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> in the future. While traditional adaptation of existing crop systems addresses these challenges to a limited extent, we followed a systematic adaptation approach to develop new cropping systems that achieved high productivity and sustainable water usage under changing climate conditions. We found the M-M system to be appropriate for the NCP in the face of significant warming, as it achieved high productivity and reduced groundwater consumption. This type of systematic adaptation could be usefully applied in other areas where climate change and water shortages significantly affect agricultural productivity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Site description</title><p>The NCP is located in central-eastern China and includes Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).

The total available frost-free GDD averaged 2704 from 2001 to 2010 at the Quzhou site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1b</xref>). Although a warming climate increased available GDD at the Quzhou Station from 1981 to 2010, the increases could not support the double cropping of ZD958 in a single year.
