<p class="p">To detect temporal trends, 30 years of climate data (1981–2010) from Quzhou for the following variables were regressed against time: annual T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">min</sub>, precipitation, calculated theoretical GDD, and number of days in the frost-free period. Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-tests at 95% and 99% confidence levels were used to evaluate the slopes of the linear regression lines against time.
