<p class="p">We used the Hybrid-Maize model developed by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (USA) and recent climate data (2001â€“2010) to investigate the feasibility of an M-M system and to identify the appropriate combination of cultivars and planting times at the Quzhou Experimental Station. The Hybrid-Maize model combines the strengths of CERES-Maize models and assimilate-driven generic crop models, such as SUCROS and WOFOST

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>. The Hybrid-Maize model could simulate yield under optimized water and rainfed conditions. It could simulate the daily development and growth of maize. This model has been tested and used widely to predict maize production in USA
