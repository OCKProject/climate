<p class="p">In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that a new cropping system would increase yield and reduce water usage relative to the traditional winter wheat–summer maize system in the NCP. Maize, a C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crop, could efficiently use water and solar radiation to achieve remarkably high and stable grain yields

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>. Therefore, we attempted to develop a new double-maize (M-M) system (with two maize crops annually) to replace the traditional winter wheat–summer maize system (with one C

 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crop annually) at the site of Quzhou in the NCP (

We then evaluated different combinations of two seasons’ cultivars in terms of grain yield and water usage to establish the new system in a 2-year field experiment.
