<p class="p">To reduce the demand for water in the NCP, several research teams have attempted to develop new, lower-intensity cropping systems

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. For example, a 6-year field study showed that systems with winter wheat and summer maize in the first year and spring maize alone (maize monoculture) in the second year could substantially reduce irrigation and groundwater usage in the NCP
