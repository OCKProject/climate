<p class="p">The M-M system reduced irrigation, increased WUE, and reduced groundwater consumption, which could also be explained by growing two, rather than one, C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crops (maize) annually. WUE is known to be greater for C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> cereals than for C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> cereals

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). The annual water requirements for the M-M system in experiment II were 589 mm in 2013 and 585 mm in 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Thus, the gaps between water supplied by precipitation and water demand by the M-M system were 155 mm in 2013 and 214 mm in 2014.
