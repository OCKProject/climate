<p class="p">The higher grain yield in our M-M system compared with the conventional system could be explained, in part, by the cultivation of two, rather than one, C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> crops annually. Maize more effectively uses solar radiation and other resources, and, thus has a higher yield potential, than a C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> crop such as wheat. Higher grain yield in the new system could also be explained by the temporal match between maize growth and available resources, including GDD and light. For the new system, yield was higher for the SS-LS treatment than for the other three treatments in experiment I in 2012 and 2013, due to the short duration of the SS cultivar, as spring maize provided a long and optimal growing environment for summer maize (

The higher grain yield in the new system could also be explained by the tolerance of the cultivars to sources of stress in the hot and wet environment of the NCP during the summer. The SS cultivar DMY1, which was bred at high latitudes, is adapted to cool temperatures and performs well in the spring, but not in the summer (
