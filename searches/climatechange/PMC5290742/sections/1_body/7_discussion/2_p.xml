<p class="p">In this study, we examined whether a change from the Con.W-M system to the M-M system could achieve high productivity and reduce water usage in the NCP. Grain yield in our M-M system averaged 19.6 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> over 2 years, which was 21% higher than that of the Con.W-M system and similar to that of the Opt.W-M system (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Irrigation in our M-M system averaged 190 mm, which was 155 mm lower than for the Con.W-M system and 79 mm lower than for the Opt.W-M system (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) than for the Con.W-M (275 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and Opt.W-M (208 mm yr

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, the decline in the NCP groundwater table could be avoided if regional recharging continues at its current rate and groundwater exploitation is ≤150 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. Our findings suggest that the new M-M system could achieve high productivity with sustainable water usage.
