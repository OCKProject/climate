<p class="p">In the NCP, the warming trend is predicted to continue
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> and water scarcity could become more severe
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref> in the future. While traditional adaptation of existing crop systems addresses these challenges to a limited extent, we followed a systematic adaptation approach to develop new cropping systems that achieved high productivity and sustainable water usage under changing climate conditions. We found the M-M system to be appropriate for the NCP in the face of significant warming, as it achieved high productivity and reduced groundwater consumption. This type of systematic adaptation could be usefully applied in other areas where climate change and water shortages significantly affect agricultural productivity.
