<p class="p">In 2012, the spring maize yield was similar among all four treatments (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), but the summer maize yield was 91–129% higher for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments. The ability of the SS-LS treatment to achieve the highest grain yield could be explained, in part, by the temporal match between maize growth and GDD accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). The SS cultivar increased the time available for summer maize, and the LS cultivar, when grown as summer maize, could grow longer before the onset of lower temperatures. In 2012, the summer maize growing season was 16 days longer for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2a</xref>). For the SS-LS treatment, GDD accumulated slowly during the reproductive stage of summer maize, and the T
 <sub class="sub">mean</sub> was 18.2 °C, which was suitable for grain filling. As a result, the reproductive stage for summer maize was 4–30 days longer for the SS-LS treatment than for the other treatments. In 2013, the SS-LS treatment achieved a high grain yield, also mainly from summer maize (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), and the summer maize season was 19–31 days longer for this treatment than for the other treatments (
