<p class="p">Grain yield of the M-M treatment was improved mainly in the first maize season compared with winter wheat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In 2013, maize yield of the M-M treatment during the first season was 9.1 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was 98% and 17% higher than the wheat yields of the Con.W-M and Opt.W-M treatments, respectively. For the second maize season, grain yield of the M-M treatment was 9.2 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was similar to the maize yield of the Con.W-M treatment and 19% lower than the maize yield of the Opt.W-M treatment. In 2014, maize yield of the M-M treatment in the first season was 10.7 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, which was 29% and 35% higher than the wheat yields of the Con.W-M and Opt.W-M treatments, respectively. Similar to 2013, the yield for the second maize crop of the M-M treatment in 2014 was similar to the yield of the Con.W-M treatment, and 16% lower than the maize yield of the Opt.W-M treatment.
