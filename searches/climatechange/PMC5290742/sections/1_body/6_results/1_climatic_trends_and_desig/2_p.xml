<p class="p">To test the feasibility of using the M-M system under conditions of significant warming, we used the Hybrid-Maize model and climate data from the recent decade (2001–2010) to simulate maize growth. We used the four combinations of long-season (LS) and short-season (SS) maize cultivars (SS-SS, SS-LS, LS-SS, and LS-LS; 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Yield potential simulated by the Hybrid-Maize model was more than 19.0 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the first three treatments (SS-SS, SS-LS, and LS-SS). Yield potential was less than 19.0 Mg ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for the LS-LS treatment, due to the severe risk of frost at the end of the summer maize season. The overall probability of frost occurrence during grain filling in the second season was 100% for all treatments except the SS-SS treatment.
