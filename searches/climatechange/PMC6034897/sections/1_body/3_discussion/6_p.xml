<p class="p">Several limitations of the study must be acknowledged. Firstly, this study was undertaken in student sample and the results may not be generalisable to the wider population. For example, females were over-represented in our sample. Student samples are also typically more liberal than the general population, and political ideology is a predictor of opinions on both climate change and genetic modification [

Although political ideology was not measured in our study, the average estimate of the scientific consensus on climate change in our control group (80%) was higher than that reported for online samples in the US and Australia (usually in the range of 50–70% [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]). Similarly, the average score on the climate change acceptance scale in our control group was higher than that reported by Lewandowsky et al. for a US online sample using the same items (but with a 5- instead of 7-point Likert scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]). A rough comparison can be drawn by converting averages to Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) scores [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]: the average POMP score on the climate change belief scale for the control group in the current study was 74% while Lewandowsky et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] report 54% in their sample. Thus we must caution the reader that the results of the current study are drawn from a sample which appears to have, on average, a higher level of climate change acceptance than seen in more representative samples.
