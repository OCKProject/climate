<p class="p">Despite the results showing that messages about scientific agreement on climate change significantly influence perceptions of consensus, we did not find that consensus messages had a 
 <italic class="italic">total</italic> effect on climate change beliefs, i.e. we did not find a significant relationship between reading or not reading the high consensus climate message and belief in climate change. On its own, this result suggests that simple messages about the level of agreement among climate scientists have no influence on individuals’ belief in the reality of human-caused climate change. We should note that our between-subjects design (measuring climate change beliefs only after the experimental manipulation) has lower power to detect a direct effect of message condition on beliefs, compared to a within-subjects, pre-post design (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]). A further consideration is the possibility of a functional ceiling effect. Our control group appeared to have relatively high acceptance of climate change (discussed further below). While there was certainly capacity for higher scores to be recorded on the scale for most participants in the high consensus message condition (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0200295.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>), it is possible that few participants are willing to report greater agreement with all items in the climate change acceptance scale—even if they strongly believe that human-caused climate change is occurring. Although we do not report a main effect of message condition on climate beliefs, our mediation analyses found that a high climate consensus message did have a significant 
 <italic class="italic">indirect</italic> effect; reading a message significantly influenced perceptions of consensus, which in turn influenced key beliefs. This mediated effect of high consensus messages has been noted in several previous experiments, most notably in the path analysis presented in the seminal GBM study [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] but also others [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Our mediation model examining low climate consensus message effects did not support the GBM, however. We find that reading a low consensus climate message decreased perceptions of consensus, but that this change did not have a negative effect on reported belief that human-caused climate change is occurring.
