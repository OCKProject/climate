<p class="p">Many of the consensus messaging studies reviewed above were undertaken using US online samples (e.g. Amazon’s Mechanical Turk). The current study using a New Zealand student sample shows that the core tenet of the GBM–the mediating role of perceived scientific consensus–holds true in populations relatively different from that in which it has been most often assessed. As noted above, our sample was more accepting of the reality of human-caused climate change than participants in a similar US study. Further research with more representative or targeted samples is required to confirm that the pattern of influence outlined in the GBM remains consistent in individuals with a higher degree of scepticism regarding anthropogenic climate change. Future research should also examine the effect of ‘low’ consensus messages about GM food safety. Efforts in the current study were hampered by a lack of pilot data, leading to a ‘low’ figure which conveyed a level of consensus close to the existing estimates of the sample (i.e. did not reduce perceptions of consensus as intended). Descriptions of both a scientific consensus and lack thereof on the issue of GM food safety can be found in the mainstream media (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]). Examining the effects of such messages and how they influence beliefs will aid our understanding of how public opinion on GM food is shaped by such information.
