<p class="p">Previous studies which found no effect of consensus messages on climate change beliefs have only examined the total effect of message condition on beliefs and did not include perceived consensus as a mediator of this effect [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. We note that mediation analyses may be better powered to detect an indirect effect compared to a total effect [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. If we take a literal view of the GBM, then the absence of a total effect in our study might be taken as indicating that a simple, one-off message about consensus may not have in itself much practical value in changing beliefs. However, the results of the current study confirm the theoretical causal path outlined in the Gateway Belief Model: perceptions of consensus play a role in informing beliefs about climate change–at least for high consensus messages. More engaging or detailed interventions highlighting the scientific consensus on climate change (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Combining consensus messages with ‘inoculating’ warnings about incorrect counterclaims can prevent misinformation from neutralizing the effects of consensus messages[

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. At a national level, there is some evidence supporting the efficacy of consensus messaging. Hamilton [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] documents a growing awareness of the scientific consensus and acceptance of human-caused climate change in the US in recent years, “compatible with the proposition that implicitly or explicitly communicating evidence of agreement among scientists encourages public acceptance of [anthropogenic climate change] itself” (p. 9)
