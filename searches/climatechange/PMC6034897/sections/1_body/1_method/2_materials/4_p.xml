<p class="p">Dixon’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] 3-item scale was used to measure belief that GM food is safe to eat (example item: 
 <italic class="italic">GM foods are safe to eat</italic>). Responses were captured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">Strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (
 <italic class="italic">Strongly agree</italic>). The scale displayed good reliability (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = .85), slightly lower than that reported by Dixon (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = .91).
