<p class="p">Lewandowsky, Gignac and Oberauer’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] 5-item scale was used to measure participants’ belief that human-caused climate change is occurring (example item: 
 <italic class="italic">Human CO2 emissions cause climate change</italic>). Responses were captured on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (
 <italic class="italic">Strongly disagree</italic>) to 7 (
 <italic class="italic">Strongly agree</italic>). The scale displayed acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach’s 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> = .72) according to the criteria suggested by George and Mallery [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. For comparison, Lewandowsky et al., report an 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> value of .78 for this scale.
