<p class="p">Cross-sectional studies typically show a positive relationship between the perception that there is widespread agreement among climate scientists and personal belief that climate change is occurring [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. A number of experimental studies have found that exposing individuals to a simple message incorporating the ‘97%’ figure in various forms increases participant perceptions of scientific consensus, most commonly operationalised as an estimate of the percentage of scientists agreeing that climate change is occurring [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Studies have also shown that perception of consensus among climate scientists can be decreased by reading information from sceptic organisations claiming there is a lack of consensus [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], reading news reports giving disproportionate balance to sceptical viewpoints [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Taken together, this research shows that individuals’ perceptions of a scientific consensus regarding climate change can be manipulated by relatively simple interventions.
