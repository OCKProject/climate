<p class="p">Based on research reviewed above, we expect that messages detailing a high or low level of agreement on GM food safety and climate change will respectively increase or decrease (compared to controls) participants’ perceptions of scientific consensus on these issues. Drawing on the GBM, we also expect that these messages will have an effect on participants’ beliefs about climate change and GM food safety. We predict that high consensus messages will increase participant’s agreement with the consensus position–that climate change is happening or that GM food is safe to eat–relative to a control group who read no message. Similarly, we predict that low consensus messages will decrease these beliefs. Lastly, we also predict that any effects of consensus messages on beliefs (specifically belief in human-caused climate change or belief that GM food is safe) can be explained by changes in perceptions of consensus. This hypothesis will be examined using statistical mediation models [
