<p class="p">Here we present a basic test of the GBM in a New Zealand student (convenience) sample, experimentally investigating the impact of simple consensus messages on self-reported personal beliefs, and the mediating role of perceptions of scientific consensus. The study examines two separate scientific issues where a scientific consensus exists but there is public uncertainty: climate change and GM food safety. Climate change was selected as it is the issue on which the GBM was initially based, and there are a number of conflicting findings in the literature (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]). GM food safety was selected as there is only one study to date examining the GBM in this context [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. While a number of studies have used consensus messages using a specific high percentage value to describe the level of consensus e.g. ‘97% of climate scientists agree…’, no studies investigating climate change or GM food beliefs have examined the effect of a similar message outlining a relatively low percentage. Does low consensus information have an identical but opposite effect on beliefs? In the current study, we include both high (97%) and low (63%) consensus messages to answer this question.
