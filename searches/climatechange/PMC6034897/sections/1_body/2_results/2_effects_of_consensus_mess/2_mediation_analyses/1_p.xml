<p class="p">We undertook mediation analyses to examine if consensus messages had an indirect effect on beliefs, mediated via perceptions of consensus. Mediation allows the investigation of the effect of an independent variable (
 <italic class="italic">X</italic>) on a dependent variable (
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>) through a third ‘mediating’ variable (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>), based on a series of regression analyses. The indirect effect 
 <italic class="italic">ab</italic> is the product of the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) and the effect of 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> accounting for 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>). Any effect of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>, accounting for 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic>, is termed the direct effect (
 <italic class="italic">c’</italic>) and the overall effect of 
 <italic class="italic">X</italic> on 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic> is termed the total effect (
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). Earlier guidelines for mediation from Baron and Kenny’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] ‘causal steps’ approach recommend only undertaking analyses to examine the role of a mediating variable when there is a significant total effect (i.e. a significant relationship between the independent and dependent variable; path 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>). Here we follow more recent guidelines which reject this approach and propose that mediation is a useful tool in identifying mediating relationships even in the absence of a total effect [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Each model presented below separately considers the effects of a message condition compared to the control group as the independent variable, coded dichotomously (message condition = 1, control = 0). Here we also control for pre-treatment estimates of consensus, thus we are measuring how post-treatment 
 <italic class="italic">changes</italic> in perceived consensus relate to climate change belief. To our knowledge, this approach has not been employed in previous mediation models examining the role of perceived consensus in influencing beliefs (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]). We note that van der Linden et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] used pre-post score differences for all variables in their path model. The current study captured pre- and post-test consensus estimates (as a within-subjects manipulation check) but only post-test responses to the climate change and GM belief items.
