<p class="p">A one-way ANOVA indicated no significant differences in scores on the climate change beliefs scale between participants who read a high consensus climate message (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 5.47, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.88), those who read a low consensus message (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 5.44, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.80) and the control group (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 5.44, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.80; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2, 412) = 0.26, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1). For GM food safety beliefs, an independent samples t-test revealed that participants who read a high consensus message reported higher scores on the GM food safety beliefs scale (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 4.37, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 1.12) than those who read a control message (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 4.02, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 1.23; 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(251) = -2.31, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .02). This indicates that reading a message about high or low consensus among climate scientists had no impact on reported belief in human-caused climate change, but reading a message about a high level of consensus on the safety of GM food among food scientists increased self-reported personal belief that GM food is safe to eat.
