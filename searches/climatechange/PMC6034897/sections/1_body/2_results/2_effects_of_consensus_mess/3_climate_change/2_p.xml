<p class="p">The unstandardized indirect effect, 
 <italic class="italic">ab</italic> = .16, 95% CI [.05, .27], was significant: the lower and upper values of a 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval (5000 samples) did not include zero [
 <xref rid="pone.0200295.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Interpreted in practical terms, this means the shift in perceived consensus caused by reading a message about high scientific consensus is associated with a 0.16 increase in climate change endorsement captured on a 7-point scale. We also report here the partially standardised indirect effect,

  <italic class="italic">ps</italic>
 </sub> = .19, 95% CI [.05, .32], implies that reported belief in human-caused climate change increases by approximately one-fifth of a standard deviation due to the indirect effect of reading a high consensus message, via changes in perceptions of consensus.
