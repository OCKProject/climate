<p class="p">Recall that, as the exploratory ‘low’ GM consensus message conveyed a figure close to the participants’ existing estimates of scientific, we chose not to further analyse the low consensus GM condition data. The mediation model for the high GM consensus condition is outlined in

 </sub> = 0.35, 95% CI [.17, .55]. Reading a high consensus message increased participants’ estimates of the scientific consensus, which in turn was associated with greater belief that GM food is safe. The partially standardised indirect effect indicates that the reading a high consensus GM message led to approximately a third of a standard deviation shift in GM food safety beliefs, mediated via perceptions of consensus.
