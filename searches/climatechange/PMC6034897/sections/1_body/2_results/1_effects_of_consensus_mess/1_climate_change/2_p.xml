<p class="p">We examined the effects of climate change consensus messages on estimates of agreement among scientists. A 2 (time: pre- vs post-treatment) x 3 (condition: high, low vs control messages) mixed measures ANOVA found a significant main effect of condition 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2, 412) = 36.80, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .15. Post-hoc tests with Bonferroni correction indicated that the mean estimates of consensus (pre- and post-treatment combined) for all conditions were significantly different from each other (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001 in all cases), with estimates in the high consensus condition higher than those in the control condition and those in low consensus condition lower than the control condition. While there was no main effect of time, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(1,412) = 0.84, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1, there was a significant interaction between time and message condition, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2,412) = 87.04, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001. η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.30. We followed up the significant interaction with post-hoc tests. As expected, there was no significant difference between pre- and post-treatment estimates of consensus in the control condition 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(121) = 0.51, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1. In the high consensus message condition, post-treatment estimates of consensus were higher than pre-treatment estimates 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(141) = 8.74, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = .92. In the low consensus message condition, post-treatment estimates of consensus were lower than pre-treatment estimates, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(150) = 8.44, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = .92. Univariate analyses indicated no significant difference across conditions in pre-treatment estimates, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2,412) = 0.07, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1, and a significant difference between groups for post-treatment estimates 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2,412) = 123.81, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .37. Comparisons of post-treatment estimates with Bonferroni correction revealed that estimates in the high consensus message condition were higher than those in the low and control conditions and estimates in the low condition were lower than those in the control condition (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001 in all cases). In sum, reading messages about high or low consensus among climate scientists, respectively, increases or decreases perceptions of consensus.
