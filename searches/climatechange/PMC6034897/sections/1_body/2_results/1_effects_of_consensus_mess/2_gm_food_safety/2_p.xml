<p class="p">A 2 (time: pre- vs post-treatment) x 3 (condition: high, low vs control messages) mixed measures ANOVA showed a significant main effect of message condition

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001) conditions. Mean consensus estimates in the low consensus message condition were also significantly higher than those in the control condition (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01). There was a significant main effect of time

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .17, indicating a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment scores across all groups combined. There was also a significant interaction between time and condition,

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .29. We followed up this interaction with paired-samples t-tests comparing pre- and post-treatment consensus estimates in each message condition separately. Post-treatment consensus estimates were higher than pre-treatment estimate in the high consensus message condition, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(130) = 12.58, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 1.38. There was no significant difference between pre- and post-treatment consensus estimates in the control condition, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(121) = 0.20, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1, or in the low consensus message condition 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(135) = 0.15 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .1. A one-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of message condition for post-treatment consensus estimates,

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .33. Post-hoc comparisons indicated that both the high (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001) and low (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01) consensus message groups had higher estimates of scientific consensus compared to the control group and were significantly different from each other (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .001). A significant difference was observed between conditions for pre-treatment estimates, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(2, 386) = 3.72, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .02, η
 <sub class="sub">p</sub>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .02. Post-hoc comparisons showed that pre-treatment estimates of the scientific consensus on GM food safety were significantly higher in the low consensus message condition compared to the high consensus message condition (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .047). The difference between the low and control conditions was marginally significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = .073), with estimates in the low condition higher than those in the control condition. Overall these results indicate that reading a message about high scientific consensus on the safety of GM food among food scientists increases individuals’ perceptions of scientific agreement on the issue. Given that the ‘low’ GM consensus message described a level of consensus close to pre-treatment estimates and did not significantly alter participant’s perceptions of consensus relative to pre-treatment estimates, we remove this group from subsequent analyses (combining the no message group and the low GM consensus group into a single control group did not substantially alter results, see
