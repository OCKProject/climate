<p id="Par63" class="p">Priorities for conservation action in the face of climate change within a particular region must include an understanding of how climate change interacts with the myriad other forces affecting conservation of wild landscapes, and how adaptation can most effectively be carried out within the social, political, and cultural contexts that influence governance and adaptation decisions in that region. Fortunately, some frameworks have successfully helped practitioners integrate climate change planning into management actions (e.g., Gleeson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2011</xref>; Poiani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2011</xref>; Cross et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2013</xref>; Raymond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2013</xref>; Janowiak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2014</xref>). Some decision-support tools, such as scenario planning (e.g., Weeks et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2011</xref>; Rowland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2014</xref>), are useful for integrating climate change alongside other stressors and land uses, facilitating collaborative planning across disciplines and organizations. Further use of these methods and frameworks may help to address a number of the barriers and opportunities identified by participants in this study. In fact, our results suggest that within some landscapes increased investment in adaptation planning and the translation of existing science into management actions may be more effective at addressing key barriers than would investing in more or ‘better’ science on climate impacts.
