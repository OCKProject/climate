<p id="Par64" class="p">By connecting networks of individuals, collaboration should enable identification, education and support of climate change leaders and advocates. In working with targeted advocates, particularly in areas with relatively less political, public or agency/organizational support for climate change, it may be useful to discuss approaches for effectively bringing climate change considerations into discussions and planning sessions with co-workers and organizational leadership. Broadening the reach of climate change planning and educational efforts to include other planning professionals, such as city, municipal/county, and regional planners and local-elected and regionally-elected officials, could also contribute to increasing political support for adaptation. As collaboration is an important tool for understanding local and cultural contexts, as well as for building capacity to mobilize resources and expertize to address complex natural resource challenges (Wondolleck and Yaffee
