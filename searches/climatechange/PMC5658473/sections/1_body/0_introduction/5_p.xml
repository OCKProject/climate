<p id="Par6" class="p">Although a small number of studies do focus on the policies, processes, and organizations/agencies responsible for natural resource management and climate change adaptation in rural and wild landscapes (e.g., Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ellenwood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lemieux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>), research on adaptation barriers and opportunities has largely focused on urban planning (e.g., Preston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2010</xref>; Flugman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011</xref>; Uittenbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2012</xref>), and coastal zone and water management (Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>). Additionally, research has most often involved single or neighboring regions and municipalities (Burch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2010</xref>; Dannevig et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2012</xref>; Broto and Bulkeley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2013</xref>), leaving a need for comparative studies across contexts, particularly in addressing biodiversity conservation (Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>; Eisenack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>). Recent studies also identify the need to move beyond basic enumeration of barriers into a more nuanced understanding of the factors both within a particular context and across contexts to understand how they might be addressed (Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>). Research suggests that the “counterpoint” to a particular barrier may not be the most effective way to overcome it (Biesbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>: 1125); for example, if a lack of human resources is cited as a barrier, simply hiring more staff may not help if the leadership and political will are not present to ensure that new staff are incorporating climate change into their work. Therefore, investigation of opportunities in addition to barriers adds important insight into what is actually driving climate change adaptation actions and how specific barriers might be overcome (Eisenack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>). Research, particularly qualitative inquiry, focusing on perceptions and experiences of key individuals in resource management working on adaptation is recognized as a valuable tool for understanding what is limiting adaptation and how efforts can best be advanced (Tompkins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">2010</xref>). In summary, there is a recognized need for in-depth, cross-site investigation of factors inhibiting and promoting climate change adaptation, particularly in the field of natural resource management.
