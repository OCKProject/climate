<p id="Par2" class="p">As the climate changes, scientists, policy makers, municipal planners, and natural resource managers face the challenge of assessing impacts and planning adaptation actions to manage the already complex systems for which they are responsible. While adaptation planning within social and ecological systems is progressing (NRC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2010</xref>; Bierbaum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>), implementation of adaptation actions is not keeping pace with an ever-increasing need (Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>; Runhaar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2012</xref>; Bierbaum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). To understand this “stubborn gap” between the perception of climate change as a significant issue and the development of on-the-ground adaptation actions (Betsill and Bulkeley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2007</xref>: 448), a growing body of research addresses the barriers and opportunities affecting adaptation (Bassett and Shandas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2010</xref>; Uittenbroek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lemieux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). Generally, barriers are considered factors that may hamper the process of developing and implementing climate change adaptation actions, but can be overcome using a variety of means and approaches (Moser and Ekstrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2010</xref>); opportunities (also referred to as drivers, bridges, triggers, stimuli) are factors that can promote, enable, or strengthen adaptation planning and implementation (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2009</xref>; Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Engle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2012</xref>).
