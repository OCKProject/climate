<p id="Par3" class="p">Research on factors that impede adaptation actions has taken place at an international scale across a variety of sectors (Measham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>; Dannevig et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2012</xref>; Broto and Bulkeley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2013</xref>; Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>). While certain sectors, locales, or political frameworks may produce unique challenges for planners, managers and decision-makers working to address climate change, a core of common barriers seems to exist, including lack of resources (Lemieux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>; Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>; Nordgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2016</xref>), lack of information (Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>; Runhaar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2012</xref>), lack of leadership (Flugman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hamin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>), and competing priorities (Measham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>; Ellenwood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>). Within each of these general barrier categories, more specific factors emerge. A lack of funding is often cited as the top resource-related barrier, while insufficient staff and lack of time also reduce the capacity to adapt to climate change (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2009</xref>; Flugman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2011</xref>; Bierbaum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>). Information-related barriers include lack of information at scales relevant to management (Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>), difficulty understanding climate science (Nordgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2016</xref>), and the challenge of transforming knowledge into action (Measham et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2011</xref>; Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>). Lack of leadership within organizations and agencies charged with adapting to climate change is a frequently cited barrier, while a lack of political will among government officials has also been noted (Hamin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2014</xref>; Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>). The barrier of competing priorities may be a reflection of resource deficits, but may also indicate conflicting values, within an organization or at the community or governmental level (Aylett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>; Shi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2015</xref>).
