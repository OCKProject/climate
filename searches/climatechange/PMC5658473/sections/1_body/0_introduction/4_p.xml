<p id="Par5" class="p">The incorporation of adaptation into everyday action and decision-making within the natural resource management and conservation sector, specifically, has also been slow to emerge, despite the fact that many natural resource management agencies have high-level mandates to include climate change in policies and planning (Ellenwood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). Natural resource managers face many of the common barriers and opportunities discussed above, with lack of financial and human resources cited almost universally, especially by managers in state and federal agencies (Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>; Kemp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2015</xref>). Despite these commonalities, there are some specific factors affecting adaptation in the natural resource management and conservation sector. Upper-level organizational directives may be unclear, leaving managers uncertain about what to prioritize or how to translate climate science into management initiatives (Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>). Ecosystems and species of concern for natural resource managers often span a mosaic of land ownership jurisdictions, adding complexity to the process of planning and implementing adaptation actions (Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lemieux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2015</xref>). As public land is often managed for multiple uses, reconciling competing and potentially incompatible land uses make implementing climate adaption actions challenging (Ellenwood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2012</xref>). Additionally, as federal, state and provincial land management decisions must include public consultation, natural resource managers cite insufficient stakeholder support or public opposition as hurdles to implementation (Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>). Managers have also noted that the extensive scope of responsibility and organizational size—of federal agencies in particular—can slow the integration of climate change science into management policies (Archie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2012</xref>).
