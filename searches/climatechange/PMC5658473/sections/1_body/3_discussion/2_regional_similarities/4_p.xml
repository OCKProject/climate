 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2013</xref>; Eisenack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2014</xref>). Our study participants identified leadership as important in terms of setting agendas, directing resources, leading collaborative efforts, initiating projects, and sustaining momentum. These findings suggest that leadership can help overcome barriers related to competing priorities, financial and human resource deficits, and lack of long-term support for adaptation. Interview results also suggested that organizational leadership can help close the gap between national policy and adaptation action at the local level, and may be a critical factor in shifting to new approaches and new ways of looking at issues that include climate change (Moser and Ekstrom

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2015</xref>). The above results related to collaboration and leadership support the idea that strengthening the ability to convert existing resources into action can be as critical as finding additional resources (funding, time or information) (Burch
