<p id="Par56" class="p">In addition to perceiving common barriers to climate change adaptation, managers also identified a number of common opportunities that have helped advance climate change planning and action in their regions, including those related to government funding and incentives, collaboration, and leadership. Collaboration emerged in our survey results as being necessary to address the impacts of climate change, a finding supported in the social learning and adaptation literature (Collins and Ison

Without exception, interview participants corroborated the critical role that collaboration plays, particularly in enabling work across large landscapes, as well as in overcoming barriers related to resource deficiency by promoting shared resources, information and expertize (Burch

Reflecting these results, a number of organizations have adopted a collaborative and participatory approach to climate adaptation, bringing science and management experts together to learn about climate change science and use systematic planning processes to apply that science to management decisions (Cross et al.
