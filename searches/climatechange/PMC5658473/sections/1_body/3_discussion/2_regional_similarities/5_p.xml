<p id="Par58" class="p">The finding that particular barriers and opportunities are common across most or all landscapes highlights that certain factors can affect adaptation efforts regardless of the specific context or location. We suggest this finding offers support for the importance of cross-site learning. With comparative studies, the findings may yield more generalizable recommendations or principles for adaptation. For example, investing in efforts that lessen financial constraints, build and strengthen collaboration, and develop and support climate change advocates within organizations and agencies, in local communities, and at various political levels will likely help to promote adaptation action in all landscapes. Yet addressing only these barriers may not be sufficient to move from adaptation planning to implementation, due to the landscape-specific nature of other barriers, as described below.</p>
