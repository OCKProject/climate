<p id="Par59" class="p">Differences in how participants in our study reported barriers and opportunities across regions lend support for the need to also plan and develop adaptation efforts tailored according to specific contexts and the needs of particular landscapes. For example, while participants in all of the landscapes identified the importance of barriers related to political will and support, those barriers varied across landscapes in their scale and nature. In the Adirondacks, a landscape composed entirely of state and private lands, highly ranked barriers illustrated the need for increased political will and support at local and regional scales. In that landscape, it will likely be necessary to invest in activities that can increase political support for adaptation among the more than 100 towns and villages in the region, as well as within the regional Adirondack Park Agency. However, in landscapes such as the Transboundary Rockies, dominated by federal public lands and managed by federal agencies, investments in political will at the national level may be relatively more important. In Ontarioâ€™s Northern Boreal, where First Nations and government ministries are the decision-makers, participants perceived a lack of national political support as an influential barrier, a finding supported in other literature addressing integration of climate change adaptation in higher level environmental planning in Canada (Aylett

Consequently, strengthening formal provincial, federal and international policies and commitments will be important to integrating local approaches to adaptation and supporting internal networks for addressing climate change within Ontario. Understanding how adaptation can best be coordinated across jurisdictions and among different levels of government, and connecting high-level directives to local strategies and efforts will be essential to building, managing, and sustaining effective climate change adaptation in each region.
