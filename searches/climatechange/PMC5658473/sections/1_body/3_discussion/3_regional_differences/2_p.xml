<p id="Par60" class="p">Disparities among regions in the relative importance of challenges associated with understanding climate change impacts and translating the science into action should lead to differential investments in funding, research and monitoring across the landscapes. For example, in Ontario’s Northern Boreal, investment in technology to better monitor climate and ecosystem changes appears important, while adaptation in Alaska may benefit more from providing Arctic-specific climate change information and strengthening climate change expertize within organizations. In the Transboundary Rockies and Adirondacks, priorities include less emphasis on research related to climate change impacts, and more effort on building practitioners’ comfort level with translating the science that does exist into practical management strategies. The decision-making process for investing in climate change work might benefit from considering more targeted approaches to climate impacts assessment that “first” identify the most critical information needs and the sensitivities of particular systems “before” analyzing climate change projections to evaluate risk (Brown and Wilby
