<p id="Par11" class="p">We sent a web-based questionnaire to all individuals invited to participate in the workshops (n = 165), within two years after the workshops.

The questionnaire was divided into two main parts: (1) a workshop evaluation for those participants who attended, including a segment on adaptation action taken since each meeting; and (2) a section for all respondents to rank the perceived level of importance of various barriers and opportunities affecting adaptation in practice, with a specific section on collaboration. In this paper, we present the results from the second part of the survey.
