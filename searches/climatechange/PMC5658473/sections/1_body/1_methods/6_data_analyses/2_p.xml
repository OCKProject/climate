<p id="Par15" class="p">Our analyses are based on a census of individuals invited to WCS workshops. Of the survey respondents, 64% were workshop participants; 36% were invited to the workshops, but did not participate. The individuals invited to participate in the workshops were identified by WCS as already having an interest in climate change adaptation and/or as influential actors in each landscape. Due to the non-random sampling used to select the study regions as well as the survey and interview participants, results from this study may not be generalizable across all agencies, organizations or regions; yet, experiences and lessons learned can inform climate change priorities in these landscapes and should have application for other organizations addressing climate change in similar types of landscapes.</p>
