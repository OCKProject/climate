<p id="Par14" class="p">We analyzed survey data using SPSS 20 (IBM Corp. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2011</xref>). For barriers and opportunities, rated by participants on a four-point importance scale (“not at all important”, “somewhat important”, “important”, and “very important”), we calculated scores using only “very important” responses. We ranked barriers and opportunities for combined regions as well as for individual regions. Where “very important” scores were equal between barriers or opportunities, we used “important” scores to break the tie. For results and discussion, we refer to rankings instead of raw scores to show how barrier scores compared to one another within each landscape. We coded open-ended questions to identify patterns and themes, and ranked the themes according to their frequency in responses. We transcribed and coded interviews according to dominant themes identified in the survey. We present combined results for the four landscapes, unless stated otherwise, and results based on “rankings” refer to quantitative survey findings.
