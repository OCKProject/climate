Workshop participants included employees of federal, state, and provincial agencies or ministries, NGO employees, Indigenous Peoples (specifically, First Nations from Treaty No. 9 in northern Ontario, Canada), and academics. WCS invited individuals to attend these climate change workshops based on their expertize, experience and influence in their respective regions. Some workshop participants were directly engaged in natural resource management and decision-making, whereas others conducted research, education and policy work supporting natural resource management.</p>
