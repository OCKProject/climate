<p class="p">To evaluate community dynamics between time periods, we fit covariates to each probability modeled. Survey era was included as a categorical covariate of detection to explicitly capture differences between the two time periods (
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). Julian day and its quadratic term were included in the detection model to allow for detectability to vary during the breeding season. Initial occupancy covariates included elevation and its quadratic term, and historic climate averages (annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and maximum annual temperature). Since the model-estimated mean colonization probability was very low (γ = 0.003; 95% CRI &lt;0.001 to 0.009), we only included one nuisance covariate on colonization to avoid overfitting—years elapsed between historic and modern surveys. This covariate was also included for persistence.
