<p class="p">Model data were preprocessed in R version v3.4.0 (
 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>) and fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo as implemented by JAGS v4.3.0 (
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>). We retained 13,000 samples of the posterior (40 chains; burn-in: 10,000 iterations; thinning: 100 iterations). Chains were considered converged when the Gelman–Rubin statistic was ≤1.1 for all stochastic nodes. We used a PPC to test goodness of fit (see
