<p class="p">The historic dataset encompassed 204 surveys at 55 sites, with a mean of 3.46 surveys per site. The modern data included 183 surveys at 61 sites, with 3 surveys per site. A total of 135 breeding species were included in the analysis. Potential for breeding was determined by overlap of expert-defined breeding ranges (
 <xref rid="r49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>) with survey sites. Northbound migrants (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 26) and vagrant species (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 9) were excluded. Nocturnal birds and obligate waterbirds were not adequately surveyed by our methods and were excluded from analysis. Species were analyzed using a revised taxonomic treatment. Four species (EUCD, EUST, CHUK, and GTGR) known to colonize the Mojave after the completion of historic surveys (
 <xref rid="r50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>) were treated as being truly absent from the historic data.
