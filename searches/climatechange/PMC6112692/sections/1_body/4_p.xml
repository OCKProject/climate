<p class="p">For breeding birds of the Mojave, we examined (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the relative importance of climate change, habitat change, and recent weather conditions to avifauna change; (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) if speciesâ€™ life-history traits or phylogeny accounted for change; and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) the persistent characteristics of sites that maintained diversity. We predicted that persistence of the avian community would be negatively related to recent and long-term increases in temperature and disturbance, and positively related to increases in precipitation and habitat productivity. We also predicted that species would experience less decline in occupancy than their counterparts if they had higher mobility, higher dispersal capacity, greater plasticity in resource use, and greater reproductive potential and were better adapted to physiological stress and to desert environments. Additionally, we predicted that sites at higher elevations and latitudes and those with surface water would have refugial properties and support higher levels of avian diversity in the modern surveys. Finally, we examined whether the fate of sites varied by management unit to better inform conservation needs. We predicted that sites managed by the US National Park Service (NPS) would fare better than sites on multiuse public lands because of the greater level of protection that park status bestows.
