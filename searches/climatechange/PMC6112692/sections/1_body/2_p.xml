<p class="p">Desert birds comprise a species-rich, easily detectable assemblage, and are closely coupled to their physical environment, which makes them suitable indicators of climatic change (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Although desert birds exhibit some adaptive capacity to tolerate thermal and hydric extremes (
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>), many already persist at the edge of their physiological limits (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). Both heat waves and the chronic deleterious effects that high temperatures can have on fitness imperil desert birds (
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Furthermore, future warming and associated lethal dehydration risk could extirpate species from the Desert Southwest, particularly small-bodied birds (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>). Studies of the effects of climate change on North American desert birds are limited (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>), but continental-scale surveys suggest arid-land birds are in decline (
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). However, the drivers of this decline have not yet been evaluated.
