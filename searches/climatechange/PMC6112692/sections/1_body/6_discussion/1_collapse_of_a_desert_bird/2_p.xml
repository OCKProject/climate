<p class="p">The nearly uniform decrease in site-level richness across the Mojave and the dominant signal of decline in the occupancy suggest a community in the process of collapse. Community or ecosystem collapse is usually the result of multiple causes that create synergistic effects and feedbacks. For example, climate change acted in concert with an emerging disease to threaten global amphibian communities (

 <xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>), and with a complicated suite of threats to imperil Hawaiian avifauna (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). Nevertheless, climate change alone can mediate the collapse of communities (
