<p class="p">Our results provide evidence that bird communities in the Mojave Desert are collapsing to a new, lower baseline that supports about half the local species richness that was present a century ago. The disintegration of avian biodiversity may be an indication of a larger imbalance in the Mojave and an early-warning indicator of future ecosystem collapse. Birds serve many functional roles—predators, pollinators, scavengers, and seed dispersers—and their decline could have cascading effects on ecosystem function and many ecosystem services (
