<p class="p">Declines in occupancy occurred broadly in Mojave birds, across both common and rare species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Globally, analogous population declines have been identified for one-third of all terrestrial vertebrate species, regardless of rarity (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). Decline of widespread species is an often overlooked aspect of biodiversity loss that has far-reaching implications for ecosystem function. In the Mojave, carnivores were impacted more severely than other dietary guilds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). This trend was also reflected in our family clustering analysis, in which falcons and accipiters experienced significantly greater declines than other families (

 <xref rid="r42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>). Loss of predators has led to trophic downgrading and greatly altered the structure and function in other ecosystems (
