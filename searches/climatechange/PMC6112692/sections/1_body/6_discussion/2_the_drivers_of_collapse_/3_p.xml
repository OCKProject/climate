<p class="p">Habitat change was less important than climate change in driving avian community collapse. Although fire and grazing can impact birds in arid systems (
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), neither strongly influenced avian community response in our study. Only change in AET was related to avian persistence and, contrary to our expectations, it had a negative relationship at the community level and for 14 species (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). AET is strongly correlated with annual net primary productivity in the Mojave Desert (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>). Our results imply that some Mojave birds responded negatively to long-term habitat change in the form of vegetation growth. The cause of this response and whether it is associated with native or nonnative vegetation growth warrant further investigation. Precipitation is used in calculating AET, and the opposing direction of the community response to these two factors appears conflicting. However, species that responded negatively to a change in AET differed from those species that responded positively to precipitation change. Heterogeneity among species in response to environmental change is relatively common in avian communities (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>), and is expected given the taxonomic diversity that comprises the Mojave bird community.
