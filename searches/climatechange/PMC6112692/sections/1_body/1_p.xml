<p class="p">Deserts are important bellwethers of climate change. Already defined by climatic extremes, deserts have warmed and dried more rapidly over the last 50 y than other ecoregions, both globally and in the contiguous United States (

 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>). These trends are predicted to continue through the end of the century (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). Climate change impacts desert species through the direct effects of thermal and hydric stress, and indirectly via impacts on habitat and food resources. Negative effects of increased temperatures have been documented for desert birds (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>). Moreover, because precipitation and primary productivity are strongly linked in deserts, drying mediates productivity declines that can permeate across trophic levels through an entire desert community (
