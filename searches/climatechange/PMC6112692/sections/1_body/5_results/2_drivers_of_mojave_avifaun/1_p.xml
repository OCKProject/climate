<p class="p">Decline of Mojave birds over the past century was driven primarily by climate change and secondarily by habitat change (

 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). A long-term reduction in precipitation best described changes in site-level persistence of Mojave birds and had significant effects for 35 species (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Maximum temperature and precipitation in the year before resurveys affected community persistence to a lesser degree, describing significant declines of only five and two species, respectively. Moreover, contrary to expectations, community persistence was positively related to maximum temperature in the year before resurveys. Long-term climatic changes of mean and maximum temperature and mean temperature in the year before resurveys were not important predictors of community persistence. Only one habitat factor was related to community persistenceâ€”change in AET, with 14 species responding negatively (
