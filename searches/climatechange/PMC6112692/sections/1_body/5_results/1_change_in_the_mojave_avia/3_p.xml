<p class="p">Occupancy declines translated into site-level losses of species richness (

 </xref>). Sites decreased on average by 17.9 bird species (95% CRI −20.5 to −15.5), or 42% of their richness, from the historic time period. As a result, 55 of 61 sites experienced a significant decline in richness. This drop in species richness was the result of a mean loss of 20.9 species per site (95% CRI −13.0 to −29.3) and a mean gain of 3.0 species (95% CRI 0.6 to 5.6). The decline in avian occupancy and richness from the historic to the modern era was not due to lower detectability of species during our resurveys. Species present at a site during modern surveys were very likely to be encountered at least once (
