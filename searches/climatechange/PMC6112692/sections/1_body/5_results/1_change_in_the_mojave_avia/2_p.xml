<p class="p">The interplay of colonization and persistence dynamics resulted in an average modern occupancy probability (ψ

Four species absent historically—the nonnative European starling (EUST), chukar (CHUK), Eurasian collared-dove (EUCD), and the invasive great-tailed grackle (GTGR)—now occur at a limited number of sites (mean ψ

Species with large significant decreases in occupancy probabilities (&gt;0.30) included the American kestrel, northern mockingbird, prairie falcon, turkey vulture, western wood-pewee, white-throated swift, western kingbird, chipping sparrow, mourning dove, sharp-shinned hawk, violet-green swallow, and Brewer’s sparrow. Most were widespread historically (ψ
