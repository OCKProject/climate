<p class="p">Change in the Mojave avian community over the past century was characterized by species loss without replacement at resurveyed sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). A strong signal of avifaunal decline is apparent from the community-level measures estimated by the dynamic multispecies occupancy model, for which there was no evidence of lack of fit to the data [posterior predictive check (PPC) = 0.13]. Across the community, the mean probability of species persistence at occupied sites between the two time periods was moderately low [ϕ = 0.43; 95% credible interval (CRI) 0.31 to 0.55], and the mean probability of species colonizing unoccupied sites was close to zero (γ = 0.003; 95% CRI &lt;0.001 to 0.009). Only the common raven and Bewick’s wren had colonization probabilities &gt;0.10. On the other hand, species persistence probabilities at sites were uniformly distributed across the community, with mean values ranging from 0.03 to 0.96. See
