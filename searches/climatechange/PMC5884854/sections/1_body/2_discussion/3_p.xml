<p id="Par18" class="p">Second, our simulations showed that forest communities experienced major changes in their species composition across the entire gradient under climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), which appeared to be the strongest driver of changes in productivity in either

 </sup>. Regarding species interactions, we have already discussed above how the change in the strength of species interactions may interact with the change in species composition driven by new climatic conditions to explain the effect of climate change on DPRs. However, evidence for the role of climate change-induced extinctions and colonizations in forest productivity changes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) is strongly related to the effect of climate on environmental filtering. Therefore, our findings illustrate how changes in tree recruitment could play a key role on forest composition and functioning under climate change
