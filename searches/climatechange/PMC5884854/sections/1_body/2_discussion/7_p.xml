<p id="Par22" class="p">One limitation of our study is that simulations tested the impacts of climate change on community composition mainly through higher temperatures and more severe droughts. However, regarding biotic interactions, the current version of the model focuses on competition for light (although mediated by climatic and soil factors), and did not consider competition for nutrients nor competition for water, which may also be a key process affecting future species assemblages under climate change, particularly under a drier climate

 </sup>. For instance, we may expect that the trend depicted here regarding the importance of indirect effects could be amplified by considering competition for water in the driest sites because of a larger number of species disappearing. This study also did not consider the impact of abiotic disturbances in the climate change scenarios because we chose to focus on the dual impact of climate change through the direct and indirect effects. However, incorporating this other kind of impact through increased mortality events may be possible in a modelling study using the same kind of models than here. In addition, our model is not accounting for changes in trophic interactions, such as insect herbivory or pathogen attack, which may also change under future climate
