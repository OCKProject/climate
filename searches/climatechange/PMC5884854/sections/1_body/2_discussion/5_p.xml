<p id="Par20" class="p">It is noteworthy that indirect effects mostly arose from the possibility that during a simulation, a species may go extinct or colonize a site because of the effect of climatic conditions on the ability of the species to establish seedlings in this site (regeneration) and on its competitive ability (that depends on tree growth) relative to the co-existing species. Therefore, this study was, to our knowledge, the first to explore the relative weight of direct and indirect effects. Relying on forests at pseudo-equilibrium in terms of biomass, these simulations should obviously not be interpreted as short-term predictions of climate change impact, but rather as an assessment of impacts of changing climate conditions on forest productivity and underlying processes in the long term. The goal of this study was to test how climate change may affect the DPRs without biogeographical implications (e.g. species migration), through a fair and robust comparison between baseline (“current”) and anticipated (“future”) climate conditions. This could only be obtained by using the same simulation design for both situations (i.e. starting with bare ground and with a runtime of 2,000 years).</p>
