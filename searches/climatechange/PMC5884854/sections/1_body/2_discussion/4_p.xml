 </sup>, notably an increase or decrease in stand-level basal area. However, as already mentioned, this study focused on long-term dynamics and thus did not consider the transient phase, because our approach to depict DPRs relies on forests at pseudo-equilibrium

 </sup>. Therefore, the simulated pair-wise forests, i.e. with the same original composition for baseline and future conditions, generally show similar structures. However, in the case of strong changes in composition, changes in stand structure can occur and interact with changes in the strength of species interactions.
