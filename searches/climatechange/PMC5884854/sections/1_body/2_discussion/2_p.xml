<p id="Par17" class="p">The strong effect of climate change on site-level slope of DPRs notably leads to a greater effect of tree species richness on productivity at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>., at sites expected to experience a decrease in productivity under climate change irrespective of forest composition). Three main causes may interact to generate this effect in our simulations, as discussed below. The first one relates to changes in the strength and direction of species interactions along the lines of the stress gradient hypothesis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>, which predicts that interactions between species will shift from negative (competition) to positive (facilitation) along stress gradients. Extending this hypothesis, we posit that interspecific competitive interactions will decrease in intensity with increasing abiotic stress. Such a change leads to a stronger dependence of ecosystem functioning to species richness in 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites compared to 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites, because interspecific competition becomes relatively less detrimental for growth in 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites, which is consistent with our results. In fact, at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites, forest productivity was more reduced by the loss of a tree species under new climate conditions than under baseline conditions, mostly because such a loss led to a relatively larger decrease in complementarity between species. Adding a species to a community should increase interspecific competition for light. Yet, at sites experiencing strong, ecologically detrimental climate change, the increase in competition was, on average, relatively lower than under baseline conditions. This is consistent with National Forest Inventory data showing that overyielding is stronger at low-productivity sites when comparing monospecific with mixed stands

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>
 </sup>, as well as with a recent study highlighting that the slope of DPRs was steeper in sites with harsher climatic conditions across a latitudinal gradient of natural forests
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup> – which was also the case in our simulations
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>. However we should acknowledge that no positive interactions (
 <italic class="italic">e.g</italic>. facilitation) are included in the model, although they may be of some importance under dry conditions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, our partitioning of the net diversity effect (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) confirmed that the decreased diversity experienced by the simulated forests at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites under future conditions led, on average, to a decrease in the strength of the complementarity effect and to a slight increase in the selection effect. This is probably due to the fact that the reduction of the species pool made these simulated forests more sensitive to the presence of a few key productive species.
