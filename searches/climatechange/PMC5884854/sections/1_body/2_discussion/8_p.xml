<p id="Par23" class="p">This study shows how tree species interactions and community composition may change under climate change in the long term, which can in turn strongly affect ecosystem functioning, across a wide range of site conditions. These results represent a baseline for predicting change in mean productivity and DPRs in response to climate change in the long term. It could be supplemented by the inclusion of other processes, like species range shifts

 </sup> or biotic (e.g. pest outbreaks) or abiotic (e.g. windstorms) disturbances. However, model complexification comes at the cost of lower precision and robustness whereas our model works with only few parameters and is applicable to a large range of species and environmental conditions.
