<p id="Par24" class="p">Relying on the emergent properties of the simulations, our results illustrate how new climatic conditions may affect forest productivity in the long term. The strong evidence we found regarding the strength of biotic indirect effects of climate change on ecosystem functioning, through both species loss and recruitment of new species, stresses the key role of biodiversity in promotingÂ ecosystem resistance and resilience to climate change
