However, considering changes in community composition also related to species range shifts was not relevant in the present study because doing so would have supposed to precisely focus on transient dynamics at the regional scale, which was impossible to do with sufficient robust confidence with this kind of model

 </sup>. Furthermore, it would have necessitated a completely different study design, by considering a restricted species pool, different for each site, i.e. including only the species biogeographically present in the region to which each site belongs. Doing so would necessarily affect the between-site comparisons as the simulations would not rely on the same species composition in each site. Finally, this would have required to parameterize the model for other species (like Mediterranean trees and shrubs). However, it is noteworthy that our simulations took into account climate-induced extinctions, although coarsely, as well as colonization by species embedded in the model. Furthermore, regarding the relative strength of direct and indirect effects, coupling our simulations with predictions of species range shifts to also take into account the possible colonization by other species would have necessarily increased the relative importance of indirect effects, and would have thus probably strengthened our main conclusion.
