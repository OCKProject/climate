 </sup>, but they demonstrate that its impact varies greatly in direction and also in magnitude across sites. Second, our results demonstrate that forest productivity positively correlates with realized tree species richness even under a changed climate,

Third, the outcomes of the simulations reveal that although both direct and indirect effects of climate change significantly affect forest productivity, indirect effects related to changes in community composition are pivotal. On average, indirect effects amounted to 71.3% of the changes in productivity across all simulations (site-level averages ranged from 50.3 to 90.2%). This occurred mostly because new climatic conditions promote the recruitment of new species at the coldest sites, whereas they cause local extinctions at other sites. Overall, this study is the first aiming at quantifying both direct and indirect effects within the same integrated approach, and it emphasizes the importance of considering the role of biodiversity when assessing climate change impacts on ecosystem productivity
