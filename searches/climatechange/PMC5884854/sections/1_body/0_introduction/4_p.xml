<p id="Par5" class="p">In this study, we therefore used a FSM to quantify the potential relative importance of these direct and indirect effects on forest productivity, and to test how DPRs are theoretically affected by climate change, considering combinations of 30 European tree species and a wide range of environmental conditions in Central Europe (TableÂ

More specifically, through a large set of simulations, we aimed at:
