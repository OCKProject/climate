 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>
 </sup>. Recently, novel approaches have been proposed to depict and quantify DPRs in tree communities, involving simulations with process-based forest succession models (FSMs)

 </sup>. These approaches have the advantage that they can shed light on the mechanisms linking diversity and productivity also in mature forest systems. Furthermore, modelling studies make it possible to test a vast number of combinations of climatic conditions and diversity levels, which is very difficult based on observations due to confounding factors (e.g. mixed forests growing on fertile soils), and practically infeasible in experiments.
