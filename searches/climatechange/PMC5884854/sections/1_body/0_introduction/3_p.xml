 </sup>, the relative importance of the direct (i.e., through species response to abiotic conditions) and indirect (i.e., through changes in community composition) effects of climate change has not been yet evaluated within the same general approach. As FSMs take both abiotic (climatic, soil) and biotic (competition) factors into account, studies with such models are particularly relevant to disentangle these direct and indirect effects. In other words, owing to such a simulation approach, the changes of productivity can be partitioned into the direct effect of climate change on forest growth
