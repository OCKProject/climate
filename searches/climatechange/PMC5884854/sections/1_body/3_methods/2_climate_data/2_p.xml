<p id="Par32" class="p">We used simulated time series data with stationary climatic conditions (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>. no trend across time, but including inter-annual variability) for both baseline and anticipated climate, to run the simulations over 2,000 years because the main objective of this study was to explore how climate change affects the DPR from a theoretical point of view, and not to produce robust predictions of changes in DPR in the next century. From the transient RCM data, we thus only used the years 2090â€“2100, repeating these years randomly over a 2,000-yr period to consider anticipated climatic conditions that were also assumed to be stationary.
