<p id="Par29" class="p">Other resources, such as nitrogen and water, are affecting species performance and vary across sites. While nitrogen availability is a constant at the site level, water availability can vary across years and there is no explicit competition for water between co-existing trees. To calculate weather-dependent factors, mean monthly temperatures and monthly precipitation sums are used. The model is further constrained by soil water holding capacity to calculate a hydric budget for each year in each site. From diameter at breast height, the sizes of other tree compartments (

 </sup>. Species coexistence in forest gap models occurs from two main mechanisms: first, trade-offs evident from life-history strategies, such as high rates of colonization often being tied to low shade tolerance, or typically short lifespans of early successional, fast-growing trees; and second, the fact that cyclical succession is occurring on each individual patch, such that species with different properties are able to dominate during different parts of the cycle. Tree mortality is stochastic and has a background and a growth-related components. The former depends on species maximum longevity, whereas the latter is an integral proxy for stress conditions, i.e. tree vigor; since competition affects individual tree growth, it also has an indirect effect on simulated mortality rates via growth-related mortality
