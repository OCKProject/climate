 </sup>. Patches being set to be horizontally homogeneous, there is no intra-patch variation in light availability at a given height, and thus at the ground level. The rationale for doing so is that the patch size is usually small (800 m

Browsing sensitivity varies across species, and each site has a specific browsing pressure that is kept constant over time. Principally, all species (from the species pool chosen) are available for establishment,
