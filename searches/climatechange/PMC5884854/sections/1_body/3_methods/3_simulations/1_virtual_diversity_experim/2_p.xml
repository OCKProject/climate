<p id="Par34" class="p">To warrant that the simulated forests at the end of the simulation run were at pseudo-equilibrium (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>. a state in which total biomass varies weakly across years, but where gaps continue to occur randomly in the forest), we considered the last 1,000 years of each simulation run

 </sup>. For each simulation, we collected the realized species richness (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>. final richness at the end of the simulation), relative abundance and mean productivity of each species. Mean productivity values were calculated by averaging the yearly productivity (newly accumulated biomass) over the years 1100, 1200, â€¦, 2000 (
