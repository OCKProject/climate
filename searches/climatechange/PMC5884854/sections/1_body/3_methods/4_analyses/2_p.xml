<p id="Par40" class="p">Second, to test whether DPRs varied with climate change and site conditions, linear regression between productivity and species richness were used to quantify DPRs (as the slope of the regression is a simple way to assess the strength of the relationship, as typically done)

 </sup>, for both baseline and anticipated climates. In these analyses, we considered final species richness, i.e. at the end of the simulations. However, because of climate change, the range of species richness may vary between baseline and future conditions, which may create a bias in the comparison of slopes. Therefore we also performed linear regression between productivity and species richness along the same species richness range (i.e. between n = 1 and the lowest maximum richness reached over all simulations in either baseline or anticipated conditions). The estimates calculated for each slope varied very weakly in comparison to the original calculations, and these additional analyses thus led to the same results. Linear regressions between productivity and functional dispersion were also carried-out at the site level for baseline conditions and all RCM conditions. Normality of the residuals was checked using Q-Q plots. Functional diversity was calculated from all species parameters (considered as traits) using the functional dispersion index
