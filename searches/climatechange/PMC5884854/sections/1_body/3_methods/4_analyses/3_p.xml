<p id="Par41" class="p">Furthermore, the net effects of tree diversity on forest productivity can be explained by two basic classes of mechanisms, referring either to the presence of particular species (selection effects) or to a more efficient use of resources in diverse communities due to niche differentiation or facilitation (complementarity effects)

 </sup>. To test for their relative role, we first quantified the net biodiversity effect (in all simulations with more than one species in the community at the beginning of the simulation) as the difference between the simulated productivity of a multi-species forest and its expected productivity under the null hypothesis of additivity (no diversity effect), based on the simulated productivity of monospecific forests of component species, according to their final relative abundance (in terms of biomass) at the end of the simulation. Then we partitioned the net biodiversity effect into selection (
