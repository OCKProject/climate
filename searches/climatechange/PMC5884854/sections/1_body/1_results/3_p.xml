<p id="Par12" class="p">Differences in climate between baseline and RCM ‘future’ conditions led to different realized forest communities (with different tree species richness) and productivity for the same initial species combination (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Changes in species richness followed the same pattern as changes in productivity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>), and were positively correlated with each other across all simulations (r = 0.54, n = 81741 (i.e. 11 × 7431), p &lt; 0.001, Pearson correlation). We also tested how climate change affects functional diversity by calculating changes in functional dispersion

 </sup> between baseline and RCM conditions. A weaker trend than for species richness was found as all sites experienced, on average, a decrease in 
 <italic class="italic">FDis</italic> (r = 0.27, n = 81741, p &lt; 0.001). However, the strongest decreases in 
 <italic class="italic">FDis</italic> were predicted to occur at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites, demonstrating that community composition and productivity remain tightly related also in a changed climate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). To confirm these findings without considering the intra-site variability, we used the median of all simulations at the site level to calculate Spearman correlations across all sites. Changes in richness and changes of productivity were strongly correlated (r = 0.94, P &lt; 0.0001), as well as changes in 
 <italic class="italic">FDis</italic> and changes of productivity (r = 0.64, P &gt; 0.0001).
