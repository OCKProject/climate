<p id="Par14" class="p">The partitioning of the net diversity effect showed that changes in productivity between current and future climate were mostly driven by changes in complementarity effects and depended on site conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>). At sites where productivity was reduced under climate change (
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic>), we observed weak changes, with a relative increase of selection effects and a relative decrease of complementarity effects. At sites benefitting from climate change (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+), the changes in complementarity were strong, especially for 3 sites (Fig.

 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites,
