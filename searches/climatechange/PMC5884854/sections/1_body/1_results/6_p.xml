<p id="Par15" class="p">We found that forest productivity strongly increased with realized species richness under both baseline and RCMs conditions (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> for the detailed DPR diagram for Adelboden [
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ site] and Schwerin [
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> site]; and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> for all sites). The simulations further indicated that DPRs were affected by climate change but only in terms of magnitude, and according to predicted change in site productivity under future conditions. DPRs largely strengthened at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites, but showed variable responses at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites, regardless of the RCM considered (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>, and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites mostly showed stronger DPRs, with steeper slopes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Among the 21 DPRs evaluated at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites (7 sites x 3 RCMs), 15 showed significantly larger slope estimates than the corresponding DPR under baseline conditions; one was significantly weaker and five were non-significant (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Thus, these results showed that under more stressful conditions (
 <italic class="italic">i.e</italic>. in 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites), losing one tree species from the forest community would generally be more detrimental than under current conditions.
