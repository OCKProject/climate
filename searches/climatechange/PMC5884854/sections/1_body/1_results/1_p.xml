<p id="Par10" class="p">The simulated impacts of climate change on forest productivity varied strongly across the gradient of current site conditions, irrespective of their composition. Forests on sites with the coldest conditions experienced, on average, an increase in productivity (hereafter named “
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites”), while forests on the warmest sites showed a productivity decrease (hereafter “
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites”) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). For instance, productivity increased by 0.68 (±0.47) t.ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at Davos (site with a mean annual temperature (MAT) of 3.0 °C), but decreased by 0.48 (±0.39) t.ha
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at Basel (9.2 °C MAT). It appeared that forest productivity was enhanced by the increase in mean temperature in the coldest sites, while it dropped at the other sites because of the decrease in precipitation. However, the interaction between changes in temperature and rainfall could have impacted changes in productivity. For instance, the forests simulated in the site of Bever are on average more productive under future conditions, because this site is the second coldest of the gradient, but this effect is weak because Bever is also one of the driest sites (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). It is also noticeable that the sites with the simulated forests showing the lowest productivity under current conditions were not necessarily 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites under new conditions (eg. forests simulated in the site of Sion experienced a decreased in their productivity, while they have the weakest productivity under current conditions).
