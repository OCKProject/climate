<p id="Par13" class="p">The partitioning of the change in productivity (

 <italic class="italic">ΔP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">0</italic>−
  <italic class="italic">1</italic>
 </sub> varied strongly across sites. At 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites, the response of forest productivity to climate change depended primarily on species only able to grow under future conditions (highly positive

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), which overcompensated the loss in productivity of species present under both conditions (always negative 
 <italic class="italic">ΔP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">1−1</italic>
 </sub>, black bars). The response of productivity at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites was equally determined by local extinctions (negative 
 <italic class="italic">ΔP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">1−0</italic>
 </sub>, red bars) and by the loss in productivity of species present under both conditions (mostly negative 
 <italic class="italic">ΔP</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">1−1</italic>
 </sub>, black bars). Therefore, at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ sites the productivity increase under climate change was mainly due to warmer conditions allowing for the recruitment and growth of new species, while at 
 <italic class="italic">P−</italic> sites communities were affected by local extinctions leading to a decrease in productivity, provided that no colonization by “new” species (i.e. allowed by the new climate conditions) was occurring.
