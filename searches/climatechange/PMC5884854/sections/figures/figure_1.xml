   <sub class="sub">1−1</sub> is the difference in productivity between anticipated and baseline climate conditions of species present in both conditions (which may be either positive or negative as represented by the black arrows), ΔP

   <sub class="sub">1−0</sub> is necessarily negative), and ΔP
   <sub class="sub">0−1</sub> increase in productivity due to species able to grow only in anticipated conditions (blue trees in right panel; and ΔP
   <sub class="sub">0−1</sub> is necessarily positive).
