  <p class="p">Direction of the mean change in productivity across all simulations, and direction of the change in the slope of diversity-productivity relationships (DPRs) between baseline and anticipated RCMs conditions for all sites and all RCMs (KNMI, SHMI, MPI). 
   <italic class="italic">Mean change in productivity:</italic> upward pointing arrow: forest productivity is larger under RCMs conditions than under baseline conditions (i.e. 
   <italic class="italic">P</italic>+ site); downward pointing arrow: forest productivity is larger under baseline conditions than under RCMs conditions (i.e. 
   <italic class="italic">P−</italic> site). Note that only one arrow was used as the trend was consistent for all RCMs for all sites. 
   <italic class="italic">Change in DPR slope:</italic> upward pointing arrow: Slope of DPR under the RCM conditions steeper than under baseline conditions; downward pointing arrow: Slope of DPR under baseline conditions steeper than under the RCM conditions; flat hyphen: no significant difference between the two slopes. Slope values are shown in Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>, for all RCMs conditions. Mean changes in productivity for each RCMs are shown in Table
