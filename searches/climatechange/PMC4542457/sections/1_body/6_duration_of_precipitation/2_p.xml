<p class="p">Long-term observational records of subdaily precipitation are relatively sparse, which makes it difficult to give a general assessment of trends in subdaily extremes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>]. Many recent observational studies have instead focussed on the relationship between short-duration precipitation rates and the local surface temperature in variability within the current climate. In the first of these studies, a high-resolution record from the Netherlands was found to give a sensitivity of 7 % K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for daily precipitation as compared to 14 % K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> for hourly precipitation over a range of temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Similar behavior was found in some but not all subsequent studies in different regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]; see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>] for an in-depth discussion. Factors such as relative humidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>], large-scale dynamics and temperature gradients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], and transitions from stratiform to convective precipitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] are thought to be important for the scaling of precipitation extremes with temperature in the current climate, and some of these factors may have a different effect on hourly and daily precipitation. While the sensitivity of precipitation extremes for long-term climate change need not be the same as for variability in a given climate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>], understanding the sensitivity of subdaily precipitation extremes in the present-day climate is an important starting point.
