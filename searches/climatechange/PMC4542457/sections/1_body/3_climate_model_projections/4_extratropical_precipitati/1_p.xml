<p class="p">The multimodel-median sensitivity is shown by the green line with circles in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, and the multimodel median of the sensitivity averaged over the extratropics is 6 % K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. A slightly lower extratropical sensitivity of 5 % K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> is obtained if it is normalized by the change in extratropical-mean surface temperature rather than global-mean surface temperature. The intermodel spread in the response (dotted lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) is small in the extratropics, consistent with the fact that most extratropical precipitation extremes are associated with cyclones and fronts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>•, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>] that may be expected to be reasonably well simulated. However, global models with conventional parameterizations are unable to simulate precipitation extremes from mesoscale convective systems over midlatitudes in summer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>], and so the results from these models are not reliable for regions and times of year in which these systems are important.
