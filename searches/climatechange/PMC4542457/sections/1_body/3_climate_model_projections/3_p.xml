 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>•]. To illustrate basic features of the response, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the sensitivity of the 99.9th percentile of daily precipitation to warming as a function of latitude in simulations with 15 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). Sensitivities for climate change (% K
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) are calculated as the change in the 99.9th percentile between the final two decades of the twentieth century in the historical simulations and the final two decades of the twenty-first century in the warmer RCP8.5 simulations, normalized by the value in the historical simulations and the change in global-mean surface air temperature.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2" class="xref">2</xref> Note that the sensitivities from observations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and from simulations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> should not be compared in detail, because of the different time periods, geographic coverage, and measure of extreme precipitation used. We first discuss the simulated response of extratropical precipitation extremes, followed by tropical precipitation extremes and the use of observed variability to better constrain the intermodel spread.
