<p class="p">Regional climate-model simulations exhibit large fractional decreases in maximum winter daily snowfall over much of western Europe, but little change or increases in other parts of Europe that are climatologically colder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>]. As in the simple theory and in global climate-model simulations, there is a strong link in regional simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">88</xref>] and downscaled global simulations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] between the changes in snowfall extremes and the local climatological temperature in the control climate.
