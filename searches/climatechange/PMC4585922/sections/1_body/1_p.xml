<p class="p">Sea-level rise will exacerbate the impacts of storm waves on atolls’ coral reefs by reducing wave breaking at the reef crest and increasing the water depth relative to the hydrodynamic roughness over the reef flat. This, in turn, reduces wave-energy dissipation due to interactions with the seabed

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. By reducing incident wave energy dissipation, sea-level rise will cause larger waves to impact the coastline
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. These larger waves will increase the resulting wave-driven set-up
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> and thus water levels at the shoreline. Storm wave-induced water levels and the resulting flooding threatens terrestrial infrastructure and can contaminate the thin freshwater lens underlying islands with saltwater

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> generally have used passive models to simulate inundation of the islands; these “bathtub” models do not incorporate the interaction between sea-level rise and waves
