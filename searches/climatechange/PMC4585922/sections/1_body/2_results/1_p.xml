 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>), a classic atoll with islands close (&lt;500 m) to the shallow (&lt;5 m) carbonate rim and a deep (&gt;10 m), central lagoon, is comprised of three islands: Sand, Spit, and Eastern Islands that have mean elevations of 3.2 m, 1.5 m, and 2.6 m, respectively. Laysan (
