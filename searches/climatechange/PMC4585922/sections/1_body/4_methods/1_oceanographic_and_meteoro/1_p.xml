<p class="p">The potential impact of sea-level rise inundation and flooding from ocean waves on Laysan Island and Midway Atoll’s Sand, Spit, and Eastern Islands were investigated using numerical wave - and water-level models driven by hindcast data and projected values of sea-level rise
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. There are no wave buoys with long records for the study area. Accordingly, hourly hindcast wind and wave data
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref> from 1981–2004 were used to constrain the primary wave sources (North Pacific, trade wind, South Pacific, and hurricane waves) for the area. These data were analyzed for top 5% storm conditions because they represent conditions exceeded 36 h per month, and are most likely to coincide with a high tide and thus characterize maximum water level conditions experienced in a given year. Forecasts of the wind and wave climate in the study area
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref> are not in firm agreement on potential change and therefore this study does not take into account any future change in forcing. Because of the large range of forcing conditions, the data presented here are constrained to the two end-members: North Pacific winter and summer conditions that encompass the sources described above; spring and fall conditions fall between these two end-members.
