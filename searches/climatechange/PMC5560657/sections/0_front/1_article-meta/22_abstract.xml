 <p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change is predicted to have profound effects on species distributions over the coming decades. In this paper, we used maximum entropy modelling (Maxent) to estimate the effects of projected changes in climate on extent of climatically-suitable habitat for two 
  <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> pitcher plant species in Borneo. The model results predicted an increase in area of climatically-suitable habitat for the lowland species 
  <italic class="italic">Nepenthes rafflesiana</italic> by 2100; in contrast, the highland species 
  <italic class="italic">Nepenthes tentaculata</italic> was predicted to undergo significant loss of climatically-suitable habitat over the same period. Based on the results of the models, we recommend that research be undertaken into practical mitigation strategies, as approximately two-thirds of 
  <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> are restricted to montane habitats. Highland species with narrow elevational ranges will be at particularly high risk, and investigation into possible mitigation strategies should be focused on them.
