<p class="p">The monotypic Palaeotropical family Nepenthaceae (genus 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic>) is the largest family of pitcher plants, comprising approximately 140 species. Nutrients from prey captured by the pitchers are used to supplement those taken up from the nutrient-poor substrates on which 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> predominantly occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The Nepenthaceae has an extensive geographical range across the Palaeotropics, from Madagascar through Southeast Asia, to New Caledonia; the centre of diversity encompasses the islands of Borneo, Sumatra, and the Philippines. The majority of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species fall into two rather broad groupings, defined largely by their altitudinal distributions: so-called "lowland" species occur in habitats ranging from 0 m to approximately 1100 m above sea level (asl), whereas "highland" species are restricted to cooler, montane habitats, usually above 1100 m asl [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Beyond these two major groups, a few species occupy intermediate altitudinal ranges from approximately 700 to 1400 m asl; in addition, some species can occasionally be found growing above or below their typical altitudinal thresholds. In general terms, the Nepenthaceae can be considered a largely highland family, as approximately two-thirds of the currently-recognized species occur at altitudes &gt; 1100 m asl [
