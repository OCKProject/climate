<p class="p">As a genus, 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> is characterized by narrow endemism: the majority of species have very small extents of occurrence. More than half of the highland species are either confined to a single mountain summit, or occur on a small number of peaks within a single mountain range. By contrast, many of the lowland species have extensive ranges. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes mirabilis</italic> (Lour.) Rafarin extends throughout the lowlands of Southeast Asia, as far eastwards as New Guinea and northern Australia. Another widespread lowland species is 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes rafflesiana</italic> Jack, which is abundant on nutrient-deficient substrates in the lowlands of the Malay Peninsula, Borneo, and parts of Sumatra. However, some lowland species also have highly circumscribed ranges. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes campanulata</italic> Sh. Kurata is an obligate limestone endemic from Borneo, and occurs in a small geographical area determined by the very limited distribution of a particular type of limestone formation [

 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> (few of which are well-understood), the overwhelming pattern is one of species being confined to relatively small geographical areas, where they occupy specialized niches. Unfortunately, narrow endemics are thought to be at greater risk from stochastic and deterministic disturbances than widespread species [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Many parts of Southeast Asia, the insular regions in particular, continue to experience unprecedented levels of anthropogenic habitat disturbance and destruction [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to assess the consequences of these threats to narrow endemic species.
