<p class="p">Given the established vulnerability of tropical highland taxa to the effects of climate change, the current study was undertaken to compare the possible consequences of these effects on the extent of climatically-suitable habitat for two 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic>—one highland and one lowland species—from the island of Borneo. Specifically, we posed the following question: How will predicted anthropogenically-driven climate change affect the areas of climatically-suitable habitat for the two species examined?
