<p class="p">Model evaluation statistics for both species are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183132.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. Mean AUC values from model replicates were high for both species (0.88 and 0.99). The AUC value is a measure of model accuracy, where, for instance, a value of 0.88 indicates that 88% of the time a random sample from presence predictions will have a greater probability of presence than a random selection from absence predictions across all available probability thresholds. In general, AUC values greater than 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 are considered fair, good and excellent, respectively [
