These results are likely to be related to the more limited range of the former, which is a highland species: many studies have found that species distribution models for species with smaller ranges or narrower ecological tolerances have higher prediction accuracy than models developed for more widespread species [

 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. These studies conclude that the higher predictive accuracy is a result of the fact that it is easier to separate suitable from unsuitable habitat for species with restricted environmental tolerances or very specific habitat requirements. In addition, although anecdotal accounts of additional Bornean

 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic> populations exist, we did not have sufficiently accurate geographical coordinate data to include them in the current study. Consequently, the estimated ranges of both these species are somewhat conservative and exclude patches of currently suitable, occupied habitat elsewhere in Borneo. This confers a high degree of conservatism upon the current and predicted distributions of suitable habitat.
