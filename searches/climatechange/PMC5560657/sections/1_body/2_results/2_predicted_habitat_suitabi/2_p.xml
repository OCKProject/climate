 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> is predicted to experience a small decrease in climatically-suitable area to 2040 and 2070 (-8 and -11%, respectively), then an increase of 111% by 2100. Climatically-suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> is constrained primarily by precipitation of the wettest quarter and mean temperature of the warmest quarter (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0183132.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Comparisons of shifts in these two bioclimatic variables over our projection periods show that habitat losses along the northwestern coast are likely associated with an increase in mean temperature of warmest quarter of approximately 2°C in that region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183132.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Conversely, the projected increase in precipitation of the wettest quarter by 2100 in the southeastern corner of Borneo corresponds to where the expansion of climatically-suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> is the greatest (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183132.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). In contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic>, climatically-suitable habitat for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic> is predicted to undergo a 50% reduction by 2040, and an 89% reduction by 2100 (
