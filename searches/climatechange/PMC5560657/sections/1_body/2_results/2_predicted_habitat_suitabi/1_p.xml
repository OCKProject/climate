 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> and N. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic>, respectively. Modeled habitat suitability is presented for the periods 1960–1990 (current climate surfaces), 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100 (EDENext projections). The model results have been overlaid onto an elevation layer from the SRTM 90 m resolution Digital Elevation Database v. 4.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The elevation layer was not used as a predictor variable in the Maxent modelling, and has been included in the Figs solely to illustrate the topographic characteristics of locations where each of the species currently occurs or may occur in the future. Probability of habitat suitability, ranging from 0 to 1, is plotted on a color scale, where orange represents values of 0.3–0.4 and dark blue represents values of 0.9–1. Areas with &lt; 30% probability of being suitable habitat are not illustrated. The inset boxes show higher resolution maps for areas of high occurrence for each species. The estimated effects of climate change on variables identified by Permutation Importance analysis as driving the models are presented in
