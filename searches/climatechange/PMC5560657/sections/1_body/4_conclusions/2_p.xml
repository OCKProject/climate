<p class="p">In the long term, uphill forcing of montane species due to climate change will help to drive allopatric speciation. It can be expected that widely-dispersed populations on tropical mountain ranges will be forced upslope, causing them to split into discrete, thermally-isolated sub-populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. This may be followed by genetic drift if the isolated populations persist for a sufficient number of generations, leading in some instances to reproductive barriers and consequent speciation [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. That the same process has occurred in 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> in the past, is suggested by the current distribution of closely-related Bornean montane species such as 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">villosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">macrophylla</italic>. The former occurs on Mount Kinabalu and Mount Tambuyukon, while the latter is restricted to Mount Trusmadi, 55 km to the south. A similar example is provided by the closely-related Bornean species 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">lowii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes ephippiata</italic> Danser [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Such separation into small subpopulations via uphill migration during past periods of elevated global temperatures, is probably responsible for the high degree of montane endemism currently observed in 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic>. However, this long-term prospect will be scant consolation for observers in the coming century, as several montane 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species with restricted ERs face increased risk of extinction, unless measures are taken to address the problem.
