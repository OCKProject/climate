Should hybrid progeny be allowed to persist at the new site, the potential exists for the generation of a reproductively-independent hybrid swarm. Intervention to remove unwanted hybrid progeny would be time-consuming, logistically difficult, and expensive. In the case of highland

It is unlikely that hybrids between these and more "typical" species would produce pitchers of the required geometry to maintain this association. Thus, introgression would result in the reduction in number of these specialist pitchers, potentially causing local collapse of the mutualistic association.
