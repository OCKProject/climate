  <p class="p">Collection of seeds of vulnerable species for long term storage in germplasm banks, planned so as to collect representative genetic variation of endangered populations. This 
   <italic class="italic">ex situ</italic> approach has been suggested for vulnerable Mexican 
   <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> spp. and 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> spp., as well as South American montane endemic plant species [
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. There are a number of large-scale seed banks in operation, such as the Millennium Seedbank [
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. However, the systematic collection, preparation (e.g. 
   <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> drying) and long-term storage of seeds, would require considerable logistical resources; further, the administrative and legal hurdles associated with the collection of seeds from multiple regional and state jurisdictions, would be considerable. In the absence of suitable habitat for reintroduction, this strategy alone will be less than optimal.

  <p class="p">Assisted upslope migration of seeds or seedlings of vulnerable highland species. Assisted migration has a highly controversial history [

   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Although policy with regard to assisted migration is beyond the scope of this article, a number of papers provide frameworks that may be adaptable to

   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. Given the possibility of unintended ecological consequences from assisted migration, then if this strategy is to be considered at all, we recommend that 
   <italic class="italic">small-scale</italic> trials be carried out, as has been done for North American forest tree species [
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>–

   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]), decisions regarding assisted migration will need to take into account the presence/absence of the mammalian partner(s) at sites selected for seed or seedling translocation. There is also the possibility that translocated 
   <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> populations may not encounter the spectrum of potential prey taxa that they have evolved to attract and capture;

  <p class="p">Establishment of metapopulations that include patches of suitable habitat not currently inhabited by the target species [
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Species that are currently restricted to the summit areas of lower mountains (and thus, potentially headed for "summit traps" [
   <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]) would be potential candidates for this strategy. This third option would entail the establishment of new populations, for instance on mountains that do not currently support the target species. New populations established in climatically-suitable habitat would need to be close enough to other populations (existing or newly-established) to allow free gene flow, and research would need to be undertaken into seed dispersal ranges for the target species to ensure this.
