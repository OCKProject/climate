 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] to model habitat suitability on the island of Borneo independently for each species. Model outputs present an estimate of the probability of presence for a given species between 0 and 1 for each 30 arc-second pixel, with lower values indicating that the pixel represents less suitable habitat. Sample size for

 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]; therefore, we adopted a conservative approach, using only linear and quadratic features for our model execution for both species. By excluding product features, we created a more easily-interpreted additive model [
