<p class="p">In order to allow the model a sufficient number of iterations for convergence, we increased the maximum number of iterations from 500 (the default) to 5000. This reduced the likelihood of Maxent either over- or under-predicting habitat suitability. In addition, we accounted for potential geographic sampling bias in the data (which may have occurred due to differing degrees of accessibility between sampling locations), by selecting pseudo-absences from background data with a similar sampling bias to the occurrence data [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Bias layers for each species were constructed using the smallest administrative unit for each of the three countries on the island of Borneo (Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia); an administrative unit was selected for the bias file if a species observation occurred within its boundary [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The inclusion of the bias file in each species model ensured that the default 10,000 pseudo-absences used in model calculations were selected from the small-scale geographic units in which species observations were recorded, and not from the whole study area.
