<p class="p">Using Maxent, the models for each species were projected onto climate surfaces for the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, which represent forecasted climate trends over individual 30-year periods (2001–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100). These surfaces were obtained from the EDENext Data Management Team (EDENext DMT;

For each time period, the EDENext DMT utilized climate projections generated from WorldClim climate grids at 30 arc-seconds (~ 1km) resolution, prepared by four modeling groups for the IPCC 4th Assessment [

 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. The modeling groups included HADLEY (Hadley Centre of the UK Met Office, United Kingdom), CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia), CCCMA (Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis), and CCSR/NEIS (Center for Climate System Research and National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan). To account for the variation in projected climate and provide a consensus average set of projections, EDENext DMT developed composite ensemble grids across all modelling groups and emission scenarios for each bioclimatic variable in each time period, using the mean value of the inputs for each pixel. Graphical outputs were produced using ArcMap v. 10.1 (Esri Inc., Redlands, CA, USA).
