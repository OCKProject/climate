<p class="p">Geographical coordinates (10 m accuracy) were obtained by direct observation of populations of both species in the field by one of the authors (CC) from 1987â€“2012, supplemented with herbarium records. For the latter, locality data were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (

 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic>, 36 records were retrieved, and 25 retained. Added to the original field observations (CC), this gave a total of 164 localities; for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic>, 55 points were retrieved and 38 retained. Combined with the original field observations, this gave a total of 54 localities. The retained records were cross-checked against personal observations of locations of both species made in the field by CC from 1987 to 2012. Only records that have been ground truthed were used in the study. The Maxent modelling software (see below) treated all data points within a 1 km polygon as a single datum. Therefore, the total effective numbers of localities were 139 and 52 for 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic>, respectively. The location data are available in
