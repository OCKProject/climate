<p class="p">It is important to acknowledge the potential limitations on model accuracy imposed by an analysis carried out at 30 arc-second resolution in areas of high topographic variability. A 30 arc-second polygon (~ 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) projected onto mountainous terrain, will almost certainly encompass a heterogeneous mix of highly-localized microhabitats that have been shaped by unique combinations of aspect, slope, prevailing winds, etc. Not all of these microhabitats will necessarily be suitable for a given highland 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species, many of which are almost exclusively confined to stunted vegetation on mountain summits and ridge tops (CC, pers. obs.). Thus, it is feasible that the area of habitat occupancy of a montane narrow endemic 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> may be constrained not only by climatic conditions, but by highly localized environmental factors and processes that operate at levels below the scale of a 30 arc-second polygon. This has two broad implications: first, suitable niche habitats that are extremely restricted in area may not be detected and/or could persist (or arise) at spatial scales that are too fine to be captured by the model; and second, other environmental factors and processes may operate at very fine spatial scales and may have more or less influence over the distribution of a species than the temperature and rainfall patterns that can be detected at 30 arc-second resolution. Despite these potential sources of error, we believe that the models nonetheless provide valid predictions of the
