<p class="p">In the case of the lowland 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic>, the predicted increase in climatically-suitable habitat by 2100 based on climate projections needs to be viewed with a degree of caution. This species is not encountered in the lowland dipterocarp forests that typify the original natural cover of much of Southeast Asia; the requirements for botanical carnivory (low soil nutrient availability, high water availability and high incident radiation [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]) are seldom met in these forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Thus, much of the climatically-suitable habitat predicted by the model will be unavailable for colonization, due to edaphic and other constraints (however, see below for an exception to this general rule). 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> is restricted largely to heath forest formations that have developed on acidic, nitrogen-poor sandy soils [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], and many—though by no means all—of these formations occur in low-lying, coastal areas. Projected increases in sea level as a result of climate change are predicted to have significant negative effects on the extent of coastal land in Borneo and other parts of Southeast Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. In a recent study, it was estimated that coastal land losses of 1% and 15% might be expected for Borneo and the Philippines, respectively, in the event of a 1m rise in sea level [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Indeed, islands are at particularly high risk of inundation: a recent analysis of the exposure of island biodiversity hotspots to this particular risk, identified the islands of Sundaland (Borneo, Sumatra, and Java) and the Philippines as particularly vulnerable in this respect [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. This region circumscribes the centre of diversity for 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic>. Thus, species that are restricted to the coastal lowlands of this area may be at risk of habitat loss, despite favorable future trends in suitable climate. That said, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> occurs up to 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 1100 m asl, as do the majority of the lowland Bornean 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], and so is unlikely to face extinction as a direct result of sea level rise. Furthermore, the creation of new nutrient-deficient substrates, due to the removal of nutrient-rich top soil when lowland forest formations are cleared for development, can give rise to a vegetation type known as "Adinandra belukar", which resembles heath forest in many respects and supports many species that naturally occur in that forest type [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In many parts of Malaysia, Adinandra belukar is aggressively colonized by 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic>, as well as by 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes gracilis</italic> Korth. Recent field observations conducted by CC demonstrate that 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> is now conspicuous at a number of locations where it was rare or absent in the 1980s.
