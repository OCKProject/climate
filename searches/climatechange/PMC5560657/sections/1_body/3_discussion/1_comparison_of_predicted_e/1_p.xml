<p class="p">A recent review of the threats to carnivorous plants worldwide cited habitat loss to agriculture as the dominant anthropogenic pressure; other threats included over-collection of specimens, and pollution [

 <italic class="italic">rafflesiana</italic> are too nutrient-poor to support agriculture, and much of the range occupied by 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">tentaculata</italic> is in topography that precludes extensive logging, or in forest formations that are not desirable for harvest (CC, pers. obs.). However, our results suggest that climate change should be added to the list of threats to montane 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species. The degree of risk posed by climate change will be dependent to a large degree upon the elevational distributions of individual species and the characteristics of the niches they occupy on high mountain summits and ridges.
