<p class="p">Elevational range (ER) is the breadth of altitude encompassing the distribution of a species (i.e., the range between the lowest and highest elevations at which the species occurs), and has an effect on the vulnerability of montane taxa to climate change. For example, one recent study identified a strong negative relationship between ER and extinction risk in birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Elevational range can be thought of as providing an inverse measure of thermal specialization, and likely reflects the degree of inherent plasticity of a species (physiological and/or behavioral) in response to fluctuations in ambient conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. An exception to this may be species that are restricted to the summit of one mountain, as it is not possible to test whether or not the low ER for such species is due to lack of plasticity with regards to climatic conditions, or lack of upslope habitat. A frequency histogram of ERs of 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species is presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183132.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. It can be seen that the distribution is skewed heavily towards narrow ranges: out of 134 species, 28 (21% of the total) are confined to ranges ≤ 100 m, and 70 species (52%) have ranges of ≤ 500 m. It must be stressed that not all of the 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species with narrow ERs are montane; however, those that are, are likely to be subject to greater risk of extinction due to climate change. In this respect, several montane species appear to be at particularly high risk, including 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes macrophylla</italic> (Marabini) Jebb &amp; Cheek, which occurs only around the summit of Mount Trusmadi (ER 
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 450 m; JM pers. obs.), 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes deaniana</italic> Macfarl, a species that is endemic to Thumb Peak (ER 110 m; CC pers. obs.), and 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes murudensis</italic> Culham ex Jebb &amp; Cheek, which is endemic to Mount Murud (ER 300 m [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]). Although high mountains such as Mount Kinabalu (Borneo, 4095 m asl) and Mount Doorman (New Guinea, 3557 m asl), may serve as refugia for montane endemic 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species during periods of elevated global temperatures, lower mountains are liable to act as "summit traps", which prevent sufficient uphill migration towards climatically-suitable zones to allow populations to persist [
 <xref rid="pone.0183132.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes</italic> species that are endemic to low mountains are thus at particular risk in a warming climate. The most prominent examples of this are in the mountains of Palawan (e.g., Mt. Victoria (
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes attenboroughii</italic> A.S. Rob., S. McPherson &amp; V.B. Heinrich), Thumb Peak (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">deaniana</italic>) and Sultan Peak (
 <italic class="italic">Nepenthes palawanensis</italic> S. McPherson, Cervancia, Chi. C. Lee, Jaunzems, Mey &amp; A.S. Rob.)), the majority of which are &lt; 1500 m in height.
