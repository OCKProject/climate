  <title class="title">Change in the predicted relative probability of presence of visceral leishmaniasis between the recent past and future (2050) conditions under alternative climate change and socio-economic scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">This was found by subtracting the number of times a pixel was predicted as present in the recent past (across 20 model runs) from the number of times a pixel was predicted as present in the future. Areas in pink show areas that are likely more favourable for disease and areas in blue show areas that are less favourable for the disease in the future.</p>
