<p class="p">Both representative concentration pathways show increases in annual mean temperature (bio1) (obviously more pronounced in RCP 8.5), mean temperature seasonality (bio4) and maximum temperature of the warmest month (bio 5) (Figure A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183583.s002" class="xref">S2 File</xref>). The area of cropland increases in all scenarios but is most pronounced in the SSP5 scenarios, particularly SSP5s (Figures B to D in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183583.s002" class="xref">S2 File</xref>). The amount of forest cover is reduced on average in the SSP 5 land use scenarios but is similar to current day values in SSP 1 (Figure E in
