 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183583.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref> compares the predicted extent of each disease across the whole study region under recent past conditions versus each of the alternative climate change pathways and socio-economic storylines (for the HadGEM2-ES climate model). Both leishmaniasis disease forms are predicted to decrease in extent into the future, possibly due to association of both diseases with low seasonality in both temperature and precipitation (seasonality in both these climate variables increases into the future).
