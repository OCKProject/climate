<p class="p">For cutaneous leishmaniasis, the geographical extent of disease is predicted to decrease dramatically under all future scenarios, with the extent of decrease being greatest under the rcp 8.5 climate pathway (almost 50% decrease in extent versus 35% under rcp 2.6). Predicted changed extents of CL were relatively insensitive to different socio-economic storylines. Although decreases in extent are predicted on average across the region, some recent presence zones will be maintained under all future scenarios and may even increase slightly in favourability for disease (Figure A in
