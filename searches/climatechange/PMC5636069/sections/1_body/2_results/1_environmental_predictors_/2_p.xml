<p class="p">When richness of all mammals is added to the models (middle panel, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), it becomes the most important predictor for CL, explaining 23% of the variance, and the second most important predictor behind annual temperature for VL, explaining 17% of the variance in distribution. The response plots (predicted relative probability of presence plotted as a function of environmental variables, not shown) reveal that the probability of occurrence of both VL and CL increases as mammal richness increases. When the richness of individual mammal orders are added to the models, these again outrank some climate and landscape variables as predictors (right-hand panel, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). However, models incorporating mammal richness variables were not found to have substantially higher accuracy than models excluding mammal richness variables (
