In the abiotic only models (left-hand columns, Tables

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>), for both disease forms, climatic predictors explain around 80% of the variance in distribution and landscape predictors around 20%. For CL, temperature seasonality and precipitation seasonality were key predictors, jointly explaining over 40% of the variance in distribution. CL occurrence was favoured at low to medium levels of seasonality in both temperature and precipitation. For VL, annual mean temperature and temperature seasonality explained over 40% of the variance in distribution and occurrence was favoured under warm annual temperature conditions with low seasonality. The most important landscape predictor for CL was elevation followed by grazed grassland cover, perennial food crop cover and the amount of irrigated land. For VL, the amount of irrigated land was the key landscape predictor followed by elevation and grazed grassland cover. The edge landscape metrics did not rank amongst the ten most important predictors for either disease form.
