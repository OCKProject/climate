<p class="p">When the bias in disease recording towards more populous areas is not accounted for in models, urban land cover is selected as the dominant predictor (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183583.s004" class="xref">S4 File</xref>) and overall land cover effects are of as much importance as climatic effects. However, these uncorrected models vastly under-predict the distributions of both disease forms (Figure A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183583.s004" class="xref">S4 File</xref>) with the corrected models showing greater consistency with predicted distributions from other environmental models and with expert opinion on the geographical variability in cases [
