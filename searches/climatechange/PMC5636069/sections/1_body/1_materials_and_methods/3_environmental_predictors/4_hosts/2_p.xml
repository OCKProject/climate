<p class="p">Sylvatic wild mammal species, spanning several orders, are widely implicated as reservoirs of the 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> species that cause cutaneous leishmaniasis [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. For the 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> species causing visceral leishmaniasis in peri-domestic settings, it is possible that wild mammals provide a common source of infection to humans and dogs [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Since the roles of wild mammal species and assemblages in transmission are important but poorly quantified, and spatial population data for individual wild mammal species are lacking at a continental scale, we included available spatial patterns in mammal richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>] as a predictor. Recent past models were developed and compared using three suites of predictors: 1) abiotic (climate + land use) only 2) abiotic + richness of all mammal species 3) abiotic + richness of individual mammal orders (Primata, Chioptera, Marsupialia, Rodentia, Carnivora) that either have high numbers of species already incriminated as reservoirs or that have high ecological diversity and overlap with human habitation.
