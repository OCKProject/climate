<p class="p">Human population density and urban land cover was considered as a predictor because (i) for a subset of 
 <italic class="italic">Leishmania</italic> pathogens, humans may function as reservoir of infection rather than an incidental hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]; (ii) for the visceral leishmaniasis pathogen, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">infantum</italic>, domestic dogs are important reservoirs [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Since data on dog densities are not available at a continental scale, we assume the incidence of dogs to scale with the incidence of human populations at this study grain. The GPW3 human population density data and the Urban Extents surface from the Global Ruralâ€“Urban Mapping were highly correlated with the CLUE urban cover class, therefore only the latter predictor was included in models. The fact that human case reporting may be less likely in rural areas with poor access to health care is accounted for in the model pseudo-absence selection procedure (see later).
