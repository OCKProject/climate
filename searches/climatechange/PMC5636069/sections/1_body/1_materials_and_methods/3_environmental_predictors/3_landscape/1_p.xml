<p class="p">Around 60 sand fly vector species are known to be involved in the transmission of multiple

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Though some sandfly vectors are forest specialists, other species utilise human-modified habitats including cropland, coffee plantations, shrubland and peri-urban areas [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Given this inter-specific variability in habitat associations, we examined the importance of availability and fragmentation of a wide range of CLUE land use classes that could contain sandfly and human habitats and might be impacted by different climate mitigation options (Table A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0183583.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). Fragmentation metrics such as the length of edge between anthropogenic and natural habitats are increasingly being linked to higher vector-borne disease incidence or occurrence [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>] because they reflect the amount of interface habitat where human exposure to pathogens occurs. The full rationale for selection among CLUE classes and processing of these fragmentation metrics is described in Supplementary Information
