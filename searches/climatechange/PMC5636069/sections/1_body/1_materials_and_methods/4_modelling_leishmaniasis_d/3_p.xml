<p class="p">Relative contribution statistics of predictor variables are reported only for the BRT model with the optimum number of trees (not for the folds). Relative importance is defined as the number of times a variable is selected for splitting, weighted by the squared improvement to the model as a result of each split and averaged over all trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. These contributions are scaled to sum to 100, with a higher number indicating a greater effect on the response. Again we report the average of these values across the twenty BRT sub-models. This model fitting process was repeated for three different suites of environmental predictors as above.
