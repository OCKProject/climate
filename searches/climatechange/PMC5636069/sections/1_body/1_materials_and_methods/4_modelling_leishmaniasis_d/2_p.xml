<p class="p">Since boosted regression trees require both presence and absence data, a strategy was developed for selecting pseudo-absence data. Since, human cases were likely to be recorded more intensively in urban than in rural areas, to mimic the process by which presence data are generated, the selection of pseudo-absences (equal in number to the presences after [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]) was weighted in proportion to human density values in the GPW3 layer. Twenty different input datasets were generated by repeating this process, and twenty BRT sub-models were fitted using the gbm.step function of the dismo package in R [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Model settings were as follows: learning rate = 0.05, tree complexity = 4, bag rate = 0.5. The gbm.step function automatically identifies the optimum number of trees for a BRT model using ten-fold cross-validation, selecting the number of trees that minimises hold-out deviance (cross-validation deviance) across folds. In addition to the cross-validation deviance, gbm.step reports several metrics of model performance in cross-validation across folds including (i) the Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve Statistic (AUC) on hold-out dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>], or cross-validation AUC, where an AUC value of 0.5 indicates no discriminative ability between presence and absence, and a value of 1 indicates perfect discrimination; (ii) cross-validation coefficient, which is the Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient between the predicted probability of presence and the true presence/background for the hold-out dataset. We report the average of these metrics across the twenty BRT sub-models. It should be noted that since the models are parameterised with presence-only data and the true prevalence of the disease across the study region is unknown, they predict the relative rather than absolute probability of presence between cells.
