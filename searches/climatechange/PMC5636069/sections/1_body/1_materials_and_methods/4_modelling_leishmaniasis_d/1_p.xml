 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>] framework was used to determine the sensitivity of recent occurrence of CL and VL to land use, climate and host variability, and to generate maps of recent distributions and future distributions under socio-economic policy and climate change scenarios. BRTs combine regression trees, which build a set of decision rules on the predictor variables by portioning the data into successively smaller groups with binary splits [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], and boosting, which selects the tree that minimises the loss of function, to best capture the variables that define the distribution of the input data. BRTs have been shown to have high performance amongst methods used to predict species distributions [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>], probably due to their ability to fit complex, non-linear responses to environmental covariates.
