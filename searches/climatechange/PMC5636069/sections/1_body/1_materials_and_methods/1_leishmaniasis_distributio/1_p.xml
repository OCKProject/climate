<p class="p">For South and Meso America (including Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Venezuela), point level occurrence of CL, (3338 records available) and VL (859 records available) cases were obtained from the dataset compiled by [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. This included data from literature sources, from the HealthMap database (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthmap.org/en/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://healthmap.org/en/</ext-link>), from GenBank and Centre National de Référence des Leishmanioses (CNR-L) in Montpellier, France. Disease presence was summarised at the study grid-square resolution of 5 arc minutes (approximately 10 by 10km squares at the equator), giving 201 presence cells for VL and 803 presence cells for CL (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0183583.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The resulting observed disease distribution was, therefore, independent of disease burden or case density. The dataset spans the period between 1970 and 2013, but the vast majority of squares (73.8% for CL and 74.1% for VL) in the disease distribution have been recorded recently, since 1990.
