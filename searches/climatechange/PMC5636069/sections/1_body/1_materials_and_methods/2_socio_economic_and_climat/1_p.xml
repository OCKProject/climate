 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] framework depicts five different global futures (SSP1-5) with different socio-economic conditions, reflecting different socio-economic challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation and encompassing possible trends in agriculture and land use. Here, for Meso and South America, we developed storylines under two SSPs; SSP1 represents Sustainability where there are sustained efforts to reduce resource use intensity and fossil fuel dependency; SSP5 represents Conventional development, in which the world focuses on economic growth and the energy system is dominated by fossil fuels (rather than biofuels for example) and ecosystems are highly managed [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Within each SSP, policies to manage carbon stocks and biodiversity can be strong (SSP1p and SSP5p), accounting for multiple ecosystem services, or weak, with high rates of deforestation and degradation (SSP5s), making three alternative SSP/policy combinations in the matrix. The two contrasting climate forcing scenarios in the matrix were the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 [
