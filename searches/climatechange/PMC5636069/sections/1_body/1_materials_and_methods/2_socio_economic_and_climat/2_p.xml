<p class="p">Land use change under alternative SSP/policy combinations was modelled using the CLUE (Conversion of Land Use and its Effects) model, which dynamically simulates competition between land use types under different drivers of land use change [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This model was applied to the study area at a grid-square resolution of 30 arc seconds. Scenarios of future urban expansion were not considered, and the urban land cover was treated as a static land use category. Data for climate conditions under the RCPs were obtained from Worldclim 2050 projections for HadGEM2-ES global circulation models (
