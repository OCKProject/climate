<p class="p">We hypothesise that human disease occurrence will be more likely where forest habitats are fragmented by agricultural intensification or urbanisation, since this would either (i) newly expose people to the leishmaniasis pathogen pool circulating in sylvatic cycles or (ii) perturb pathogen-vector-host dynamics in the system, enhancing cross-species transmission rates (two alternative mechanisms for impacts of land use change on disease emergence set out in [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]). We expect the probability of leishmaniasis occurrence to increase with the availability of human-modified habitats (crops, grazing, urban areas) and the density of forest and crop edges (edge density metrics), indicative of interface habitats within which human exposure could occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. We expect these effects to be stronger for CL than VL given the wider range of wild mammal reservoir species incriminated in transmission [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. For similar reasons, we expect CL, to be particularly influenced by mammal biodiversity.
