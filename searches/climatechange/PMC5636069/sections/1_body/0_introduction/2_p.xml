<p class="p">The current global burden of vector-borne diseases falls disproportionately onto poor populations in tropical, developing countries [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], and exposure is often linked to specific human uses of ecosystems at the landscape level [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Pathogens, hosts and vectors involved in vector-borne disease transmission cycles are all environmentally sensitive and vary in their associations with intact natural ecosystems. Impacts of ecosystem changes on vector-borne incidence thus depend on a complex interplay between ecological factors such as the ratio of competent to non-competent hosts and vectors (determined by species-specific responses to biodiversity or ecosystem change) [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and social factors that determine the contact rates between humans and infected vectors [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. This interplay is highly context dependent—in the terminology of the ecosystem service concept, ecosystems may provide the “disservice” of maintaining transmission cycles which may lead to infection of humans and/or the “service” of regulating those cycles and controlling spillover into human populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Tropical ecosystems are under huge pressure from competing land uses and deforestation [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. They play a critical role in supporting the livelihoods and economic development of large poor communities [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] but also in climate mitigation since they are key terrestrial carbon stores and biodiversity hotspots [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. For tropical ecosystems then, understanding trade-offs between vector-borne disease “disservices” or “services” and other ecosystem services across heterogeneous landscapes [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] is critical for (i) prediction of health impacts of environmental and development policies that may alter ecosystems (ii) development of decision-support tools to target such measures [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>].
