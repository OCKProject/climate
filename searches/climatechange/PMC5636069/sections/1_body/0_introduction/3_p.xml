<p class="p">A first step in understanding disease-ecosystem linkages is to integrate land use patterns, ecosystem and social factors into interpretations of past disease patterns at a range of geographical scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Conditional on high explanatory power for past disease patterns, this can facilitate the subsequent integration of these factors into projections of future disease risk given alternative environmental and development policies, as recommended by [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Though past vector-borne disease impacts are now quite routinely linked to non-climatic as well as climatic drivers [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], projections of future change in risk for specific diseases are still restricted to climate change scenarios and neglect future socio-economic and public health changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] (but see [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). Furthermore, projections tend to focus on temperature changes rather than precipitation changes, that are easier to represent in global climate models and in terms of mechanistic effects on disease transmission and are rarely validated with observed disease patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. This study is one of the first to project future vector-borne disease patterns at a continental scale, accounting for future policy-driven changes in land use as well as climate.
