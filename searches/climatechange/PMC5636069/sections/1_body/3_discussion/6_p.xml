<p class="p">Our study is the first to account for both climate change pathways and impacts of policy and socio-economic changes on land use in forecasts of future leishmaniasis distribution. Previous studies have projected recent climatic niches of leishmaniasis vectors and/or hosts onto future climates and inferred likely changes in human contact rates from the resulting patterns but have neglected future land use dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Our main prediction is that the continental-scale geographical extent of both forms of leishmaniasis are likely to contract under future climate change to 2050, but that key focal areas will be retained for both diseases. Interestingly we found that the differential thermal and moisture sensitivities of CL and VL, quantified by our recent past models, translated into divergent responses of these diseases to future climate pathways, with CL declining much more in distribution than VL, especially under strong climatic forcing. These results reinforce the importance of considering the sensitivity of vector-borne diseases to past and future environmental change for diseases and regions individually [
