<p class="p">We hypothesised that disease impacts, especially of cutaneous leishmaniasis, would scale with the fragmentation of forests by agricultural intensification or urbanisation due to the increased availability of interface habitats where human exposure could occur [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. By contrast, we found that land use factors explained a small proportion (~ 20%) of the variance in disease patterns for both CL and VL at this study grain. Crop types and grazed grassland cover were ranked in the top ten predictors for both diseases but edge metrics did not rank at all amongst top model predictors. Stronger impacts of landscape factors on leishmaniasis patterns, particularly forest proximity, have been detected in studies conducted within smaller geographical regions (single country/district) at a finer spatial grain (municipality or village level surveys) and where the dependent variable (e.g. annual disease incidence) contains information about the extent of disease impact [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. We attribute the weak landscape effects detected in this study (despite spatially continuous, fine-scale land use data) to the continental study scale and presence-only nature of the available disease data, common to many global infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. We expect impacts of landscape and social factors to be easier to detect when modelling disease distributions using case incidence or prevalence data that correspond more closely to the intensity of transmission than presence-only data.
