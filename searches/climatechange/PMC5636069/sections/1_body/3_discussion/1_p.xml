<p class="p">This study advances understanding of the geographical determinants of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas by considering wide-ranging climate, landscape and ecological risk factors in the same analysis. We provide the first predictions of future change in CL and VL distributions under alternative climate pathways and socio-economic scenarios (strong versus weak management for carbon stock and biodiversity and multiple ecosystem services) by applying disease-environment relationships from the recent past to projected, scenario-specific, climate and land use changes.</p>
