<p class="p">Disease records are often biased towards more populous areas, regions with strong healthcare systems and funds for surveillance and control, and towards habitats or hosts in which primary disease impacts are felt (e.g. livestock, crops, people [

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], models of disease distributions rarely account for biases in disease recording despite their impacts on model accuracy and inference [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. In their study of global leishmaniasis distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], Piggott et al. built a spatial layer of leishmaniasis presence from expert opinion and used this to stratify pseudo-absence (and pseudo-presence) selection. We selected an approach which accounted for the process by which case data arise, namely the bias towards more populous areas with improved access to health care. Our results from preferentially selecting pseudo-absence data in more populous areas, highlight the importance of correcting for recording bias when modelling disease distributions [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. In models that ignored these recording biases, the impact of urban land cover on the disease was over-estimated, and the disease distribution was vastly under-predicted, being extremely focal around urban areas (Figure A in

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and visceral leishmaniasis has only spread relatively recently into the margins of urban areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. The predicted distributions from the bias-corrected models were more extensive and extended into rural areas and were therefore much more plausible.
