<p class="p">Our correlative methods for predicting future disease patterns from recent past disease-environment relationships assume implicitly that these relationships will remain static into the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. For an ecologically complex system like leishmaniasis, there are likely to be ecological and evolutionary means by which pathogens, vectors and reservoir hosts adapt to changing environments. This is illustrated by the recent adaptation of several sand fly vectors in different regions to peri-domestic habitats e.g.

 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] with knock-on impacts on human transmission. Mechanistic approaches such as explicit modelling of disease transmission dynamics to estimate R
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> can accommodate non-linear and often opposing impacts of temperature on transmission cycle parameters. For zoonotic VL in the Mediterranean, R
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, the risk of disease establishment once an infected host is introduced, has been mapped [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] by linking spatial climate and landscape driven models of sand fly vector distribution, to temperature impacts on sandfly mortality, biting and infection rates and dog-host parameters. These frameworks are very powerful but difficult to apply when vector and host roles and life cycles are poorly understood, as for the Leishmaniases in the Americas. They cannot easily accommodate wide-ranging environmental drivers unless responses to these drivers have been explicitly quantified. Recent novel correlative methods that infer vector-host-pathogen networks from species co-occurrence data [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] and link these to risk of human exposure particular land uses or zones [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] have a high potential for integration of climate and socio-economic scenarios. Such correlative methods should be underpinned by landscape-scale validation of vector-host-pathogen interactions and environmental responses.
