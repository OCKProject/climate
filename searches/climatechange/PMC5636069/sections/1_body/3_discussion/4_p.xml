<p class="p">When mammal biodiversity was incorporated into models, we found a positive impact of richness on patterns in both leishmaniasis forms. This predictor explained a slightly high proportion of variance in CL than VL distribution, consistent with the stronger links of CL to sylvatic cycles and a diversity of wild mammal species [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. This finding initially seems consistent with the prediction of Wood et al. (2014) that New World cutaneous leishmaniases should respond positively to biodiversity. In terms of mechanisms, more diverse communities of sylvatic wild mammal hosts may increase the pathogen pool to which humans are exposed (via infected sandflies) or may alter the cross-species transmission potential by increasing the abundance, susceptibility or contact rates of important hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. However, models including mammal biodiversity were similar in accuracy and predicted geographical disease extent to simpler models containing only abiotic climate and land use predictors. Although predictors were screened for collinearity by pair-wise correlation analysis between predictors, the mammal biodiversity predictors may be strongly related to particular combinations of climate or land-use predictors at a continental scale [
 <xref rid="pone.0183583.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. This collinearity between global climate and biodiversity layers is a key wider impediment to attempts to understand the relative effects of these factors on regional disease patterns.
