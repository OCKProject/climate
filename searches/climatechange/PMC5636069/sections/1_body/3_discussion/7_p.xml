<p class="p">Projected disease impacts differed slightly between alternative socio-economic pathway and policy scenarios with VL in particular found to be less extensive under strong versus weak management for carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services. This is expected given the lower explanatory power of land use versus climate predictors of past distributions found at this scale and does not indicate that future development and environmental strategies will have a low impact on leishmaniasis disease outcomes. Our framework could be fruitfully applied within eco-epidemiological regions or at narrower geographical scales (at which disease control decisions are often applied [
