<p id="p0075" class="p">The primary objective of this paper is to assess the measures adopted by farm households to cope with the negative effects of climate change on livestock, and the impact of adopting coping strategies on livestock productivity. There are three novel aspects of this research. First, it is one of the few papers that uses a large primary household-level dataset to understand the coping strategies adopted by farm households to manage the impact of climate risk on livestock income. Second, it assesses the factors influencing the adoption of these coping strategies. Third, it estimates the impact of the coping strategies on livestock productivity and rural livelihoods. Hence, this paper provides promising research which could enhance the well-being of rural farm households dependent on livestock for food security and livelihood.</p>
