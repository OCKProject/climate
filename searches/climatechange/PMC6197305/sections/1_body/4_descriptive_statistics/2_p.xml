 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> we present the description of the variables used in the analysis. The average age of the farmers was 47 years, and the mean livestock rearing experience was 28 years, which shows that the farmers were middle-aged and with a substantial amount of experience in farming. The mean age of the household head was 62 years, which means that the households are headed mostly by a senior member. Only in 43% of the cases, the farmer himself was the household head, which means the farmers are not necessarily the head of the household. About 64% of the farmers were married, and the number of members of the household stood at 9.28, which shows that family size was quite large. About 62 % were living in joint/extended family systems in which all the family members lived together, and generally, these were large families, compared to the nuclear family, typically comprising only husband, wife, and children.
