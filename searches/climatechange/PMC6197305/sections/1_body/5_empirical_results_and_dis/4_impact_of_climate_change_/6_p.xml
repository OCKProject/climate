The ATT results for the milk yield are negative and significant, demonstrating that migrant households have lower milk production by up to 0.62 kg/day. The butter production is negative and significant, with an ATT value of 0.25 kg/month. The household income is lower by up to 837 Pakistani rupees. Poverty and disease levels are higher. Hence migration should be the least favoured strategy to cope with climate risk.</p>
