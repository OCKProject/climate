 </inline-formula> has been reduced considerably after matching, signifying that after matching both the groups are very similar to each other. The P-value of the joint significance of covariates is significantly higher after matching, which indicates that after matching both categories of the farmers (adopter and non-adopters) were very similar to each other. In other words, the covariates were balanced, and both groups are quite similar to each other. The imposition of the common support condition and the balancing of the covariates results are also reported in
