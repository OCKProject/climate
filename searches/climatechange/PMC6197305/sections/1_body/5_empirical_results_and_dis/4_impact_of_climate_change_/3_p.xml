The ATT results show that farmers who adopted livestock insurance as a coping mechanism had a higher milk yield by up to 0.76 kg per day compared to the households who did not adopt it. The ATT results for the butter yield are also higher by up to 1.20 kg per month, and the ATT results for household income are higher by about 2,400 Pakistani rupees, a 5% level of significance. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant indicating that the poverty level is up to 4% lower for those farm households who adopted the livestock insurance.
