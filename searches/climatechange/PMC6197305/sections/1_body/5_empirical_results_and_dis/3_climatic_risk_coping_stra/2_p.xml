<p id="p0160" class="p">In the areas studied, the farmers generally adopted livestock insurance, the selling of livestock, the allocation of larger areas for fodder, and migration, as primary climatic-risk-coping strategies, which is used as the dependent variable. Migration was mostly forced due to drought, and livestock owners moved from one place to another in search of water and fodder. We employed a multivariate probit model because these four dependent variables are mutually inclusive, which means a farm household could use more than one climate-risk-coping strategy. The cross-equation correlation in
