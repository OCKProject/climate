<p id="p0140" class="p">The determinants of livestock ownership were estimated by employing the Poisson regression
 <xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn" class="xref">1</xref> model, and the results are presented in 
 <xref rid="tbl5" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 5</xref>. The dependent variable was the number of livestock owned by the farmers. The age coefficient is positive and significant at 1% level of significance, indicating that older farmers normally own more livestock. The family type was included as a dummy variable, i.e., 1 for the joint family and 0 for the nuclear family, and the coefficient is positive and significant, indicating that farmers living in a joint family normally keep a higher number of livestock. It may be due to the fact that joint families have surplus labor, which is needed to take care of the livestock. Likewise, the family size was positive and significant at 1%, which illustrates that households with more members rear more livestock because of the availability of the manpower needed to manage the livestock.
