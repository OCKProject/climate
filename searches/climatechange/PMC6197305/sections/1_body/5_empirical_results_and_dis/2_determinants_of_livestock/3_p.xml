<p id="p0145" class="p">Education is positive and highly significant at 1% level of significance, highlighting the fact that educated farmers tend to own more livestock. The area under fodder positively influenced the ownership of the livestock. Results show that the farm households with land entitlements (i.e., 1 for the owner and 0 otherwise) own more livestock compared to those without land entitlements. Household assets like tractors, cars, and televisions are non-significant, indicating that ownership of these assets does not influence livestock ownership. However, the mobile phone ownership dummy was positive and significant, which may be linked with access to information.</p>
