 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig.Â 1</xref> below depicts the flowchart of the conceptual framework. Data shows that climate change affects livestock production through a decline in feed and forage, water availability, heat stress and livestock diseases. As a result of this adverse effect, farm households adopt a number of strategies, such as livestock insurance, increasing the area for fodder, selling livestock, and migration to cope with the negative impacts of climate change. Those farm households who adopt strategies to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change on livestock are better off than those who do not.
