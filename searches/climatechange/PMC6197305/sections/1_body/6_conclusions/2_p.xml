<p id="p0220" class="p">This research uses a rich primary dataset, collected from four major provinces of Pakistan and AJK and Gilgit Baltistan, to understand the climate risk faced by livestock farmers and the strategies adopted by them to cope with such risk. Even though livestock is an integral part of rural livelihoods and a large number of livestock farmers are facing climate risk, only a small number of villages have a veterinary center, and a limited number of farmers have benefitted from the meteorological department and livestock veterinary services. Under the changing climatic conditions, the land size, family size, and access to extension services positively influence livestock ownership in rural Pakistan.</p>
