<p id="p0230" class="p">We find that households with older heads tend to pursue selling livestock to cope with climate risk while households with younger heads are likely to go for livestock insurance, allocation of more area for fodder and migration. Households with larger families are less inclined to use livestock insurance and more inclined to sell livestock, allocate more land to fodder and migrate as strategies to cope with climate change. Households with a more educated head pursue livestock insurance, allocate more land for fodder and migrate to lessen the impact of climate change on livestock. Wealthier households who own land and have more land assets are likely to opt for livestock insurance, or the allocation of more land for fodder to manage climate risk and are unlikely to sell livestock and/or migrate. Households who are members of NGOs are likely to pursue all four climate-risk mitigating strategies while those with contact with extension services are more likely to sell livestock and/or allocate more land for fodder.</p>
