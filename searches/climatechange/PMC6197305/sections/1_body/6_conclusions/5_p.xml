<p id="p0235" class="p">The PSM results indicate that climate-risk-coping strategies have a positive impact on household welfare, as the adopters have higher milk and butter yields, as well as household incomes compared to non-adopters. Similarly, the incidence of poverty levels is lower for those households which adopt measures to mitigate the impact of climate change. As the adoption of a strategy to reduce the impact of climate change on livestock leads to the improvement in the well-being of rural families, policies should focus on implementing and strengthening measures, particularly livestock insurance and allocation of more land for fodder, to cope with climate risk. A policy such as training and education on climate risk, enhancing extension services and increasing asset endowments would support the mitigation of climate-change risk on livestock.</p>
