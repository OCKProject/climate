Abstract</div> <p>Using the primary datasets collected from 700 livestock farmers from all four major provinces of Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit Baltistan, this paper analyzes the impact of climate-change risk coping strategies on household welfare. A Poisson regression model was used to estimate the determinants of the livestock ownership and multivariate probit model to assess the determinants of the measures taken to manage the climatic-risk challenge for livestock. A propensity score matching approach (PSM) was used to assess the impact of the adopted climate-risk management strategies on livestock farmers. Findings indicated that in Pakistan livestock farmers generally adopt four main types of strategies to cope with climate risk: livestock insurance, selling of livestock, allocation of more land area for fodder and migration. The results show that age, education, wealth, access to extension services, and membership in NGOs, influence the livestock farmers' choice of climate-risk-coping mechanisms. The livestock farmers who adopted risk-coping mechanisms generally fared better. Increasing the land area allocated to fodder seems to increase production of milk and butter, resulting in higher income and lower poverty levels. Those who bought insurance had more milk production and a lower poverty level, while those who sold livestock to cope with climate risk decreased production but increased household income and lowered poverty levels. Migration seems to have a negative impact on production and income. Impact assessments confirm that purchasing livestock insurance and increasing fodder areas are more effective compared to the selling of livestock and migration. Agricultural climate policy should focus on creating awareness as well as increasing access to extension services among livestock farmers on climate risk and risk-coping strategies to mitigate the impact on rural livelihoods. </p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p>Globally, more than a billion impoverished people depend on animals for food and income. They provide jobs to 1100 million individuals, and most of them are living in developing countries ( <a href="#bib13">Hurst et al., 2005</a>). Over 70% of the poor in rural areas of developing countries are dependent on livestock ( <a href="#bib6">Delgado et al., 1999</a>). The majority of these poor families live in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa and, for them, livestock is a crucial asset. Primarily, landless and smallholder farmers derive a substantial share of their incomes from livestock. Livestock contributes to food and nutrient security across the world, evidenced by the fact that livestock makes up 17% of the global kilocalorie consumption, and 33% of the protein consumption ( <a href="#bib23">Rosegrant et al., 2009</a>). </p> <p>Growth in livestock production can have a more favourable effect on poverty reduction than growth in crop production ( <a href="#bib26">Shukla and Brahmankar, 1999</a>; <a href="#bib3">Birthal et al., 2003</a>) because livestock are more equitably distributed compared to land. In developing countries, income from livestock forms a significant share of farm households' income portfolios and a large proportion of rural farm households depend on livestock for livelihood; hence, climate change is expected to have a significant impact on more than 600 million people who depend on livestock for their livelihood ( <a href="#bib28">Thornton et al., 2002</a>). As climate change poses a threat to the livelihood of farmers by reducing crop yield, food security and increasing poverty levels ( <a href="#bib1">Ali et al., 2017</a>), steady investment via information provision, education of farmers, and extension and credit services would enhance farmers' perceptions about climate risk, and stimulate adoption of suitable strategies by farmers in Malawi ( <a href="#bib18">Mulwa et al., 2017</a>) and in Pakistan ( <a href="#bib21">Rahut and Ali, 2017</a>). </p> <p>Livestock is central to the rural economy of Pakistan; the livestock sector contributes about 58.3% to agricultural value added and 11.4% to the overall GDP ( <a href="#bib10">Government of Pakistan, 2018</a>). Livestock is a source of cash income, often the only source of income for the rural and most marginal people. In Pakistan, more than eight million families are involved in raising livestock and, on average, derive about 35% of their income from livestock production ( <a href="#bib10">Government of Pakistan, 2018</a>). Livestock can play a fundamental role in poverty alleviation and in increasing foreign exchange earnings; the livestock sector contributed about 1,333 billion rupees to the gross value addition ( <a href="#bib9">Government of Pakistan, 2016/17</a>). </p> <p>In Pakistan, due to increasing human population and urbanization, demand for livestock products is also rapidly increasing. Concurrently, changing climatic conditions have a profound and persistent adverse effect on people, agriculture and livestock systems. Hence to meet the growing demand, and in light of rapid climate change, the Government of Pakistan should encourage public-private partnership in the livestock sector and support modernizing and stimulating the scientific excellence of the sector. Livestock products such as milk and meat form a significant part of the daily diet, and can help ensure food security, as the gross milk production was registered at 56,080 thousand tons, while the milk consumption by the population was only 45,227 thousand tons ( <a href="#bib9">Government of Pakistan, 2016/17</a>). </p> <p>Against the backdrop of increasing demand for livestock products in Pakistan, the adverse impact of climate change on livestock products and the importance of livestock for rural livelihood, this paper aims to do the following: first, understand the mechanisms adopted by rural households to cope with the impact of climate risk on their livestock; second, identify the factors influencing the choice of strategies adopted by farm households to cope with climate risk; and third, evaluate the effect of a climate-risk-coping measure on livestock production, compared to those who do not adopt such measures. </p> </div> <div class="background" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Background</div> <p>In rural areas, livestock plays a vital role in the livelihood and well-being of poor farm households. First, it acts as an asset for investment which can be easily liquidated in times of need, i.e., it helps acts as a risk-coping strategy and minimizes risk to vulnerable individuals. Second, livestock is an essential source of nutrients and traction for poor farm households ( <a href="#bib29">Thornton, 2010</a>). Over the past three decades, rural community dependence on livestock has increased manifold in South Asia ( <a href="#bib6">Delgado et al., 1999</a>). However, the productivity of livestock in South Asia has been low, due to several reasons, but especially to the non-adoption of the modern and efficient technologies. </p> <p>It is challenging to meet the global demand for livestock products due to two opposing issues: increasing demand, resulting from population growth and urbanization on one hand, and the adverse impact of climate change on livestock production on the other. Demand for livestock products in developing countries is increasing rapidly and will continue to increase in the future ( <a href="#bib6">Delgado et al., 1999</a>) fueled by rapid urbanization, population growth and increase in income ( <a href="#bib15">Jones and Thornton, 2009</a>). The global population is projected to rise by 33% from 7.2 billion to 9.6 billion by 2050 (UN, 2013) which would further increase demand for livestock products. The number of people living in urban regions has burgeoned from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion in 2018, and the proportion of urban inhabitants to the total population is anticipated to surge from 55.3% today to 68.4% by 2050 globally, and in Pakistan it is likely to rise from 35.8% today to 53.8% ( <a href="#bib31">United Nation, 2018</a>). </p> <p>Household income levels are also rising, and are expected to grow significantly, which will increase the demand for livestock products. The annual global per capita GDP is expected to increase from US$9,644 in 2010 to US$13,874. During the same period, the GDP per capita of South Asia is projected to increase from US$1,283 to US$3,890. It is projected that the demand for livestock products will double by 2050 owing to improvements in the standard of living ( <a href="#bib8">Garnett, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib22">Rojas-Downing et al., 2017</a>). </p> <p>A number of studies have found that climate change can adversely affect livestock productivity through changes in the availability of natural resources such as water, changes in the quality and quantity of forage, livestock diseases and heat stress ( <a href="#bib8">Garnett, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib30">Thornton et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib29">Thornton, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib22">Rojas-Downing et al., 2017</a>). Increases in temperature and CO <sub>2</sub> levels, and changes in the amount and timing of rainfall, affects the production of fodder crops and forage ( <a href="#bib7">Easterling et al., 1993</a>; <a href="#bib5">Campbell et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bib11">Hatfield and Prueger, 2011</a>; <a href="#bib24">Sanz-Sáez et al., 2012</a>), which is deleterious to livestock production. Due to prolonged drought, the dry period of dairy livestock is extended ( <a href="#bib16">Maurya, 2010</a>), and therefore the volume of milk production is lowered. </p> <p>As a result of increases in the demand for water from competing sources, and depletion of water resources resulting from climatic changes, it is estimated that about 64% of the global population will face water distress ( <a href="#bib23">Rosegrant et al., 2009</a>), which will, in turn, reduce the availability of water for livestock sectors. Further, the rise in temperature is expected to augment water intake by animals ( <a href="#bib20">Nardone et al., 2010</a>). Prompt policy measures will be needed to address these increasing demands and competition for water ( <a href="#bib30">Thornton et al., 2009</a>). The heat stress induced by climate change also results in decreases in production of livestock products ( <a href="#bib20">Nardone et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib25">Seerapu et al., 2015</a>) owing to alterations in the nutrient content of the forage ( <a href="#bib30">Thornton et al., 2009</a>). </p> <p>The changing climate also increases the incidence of livestock diseases and mortality ( <a href="#bib15">Jones and Thornton, 2009</a>; <a href="#bib30">Thornton et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib2">Amin et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib12">Herrero et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib17">McDermott et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib20">Nardone et al., 2010</a>; <a href="#bib22">Rojas-Downing et al., 2017</a>), and leads to a drop in livestock production. Climate-induced livestock diseases are manifesting across the globe, threatening the income, livelihood and food security of the people living in developing countries. </p> <p>As climate change adversely affects livestock assets, rural households, which are largely dependent on agriculture, implement measures to cope with climate change. A wide range of options are available, and households choose the coping strategies depending on availability and affordability. Some of the widely-used mechanisms are selling livestock, migration, and insurance. </p> <p>Climate change is expected to cause an increase in weather-related hazards, which can severely affect livestock, especially in developing countries. Researchers and policymakers agree that the most significant impact of climate change can be seen in the livestock sector ( <a href="#bib29">Thornton, 2010</a>; <a href="#bib19">Naqvi and Sejian, 2011</a>). However, most of the work on climate change has focused on the crop sector, and only a few studies have documented the impact of climate change on livestock productivity ( <a href="#bib30">Thornton et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bib14">IPCC, 2014</a>). </p> <p>The primary objective of this paper is to assess the measures adopted by farm households to cope with the negative effects of climate change on livestock, and the impact of adopting coping strategies on livestock productivity. There are three novel aspects of this research. First, it is one of the few papers that uses a large primary household-level dataset to understand the coping strategies adopted by farm households to manage the impact of climate risk on livestock income. Second, it assesses the factors influencing the adoption of these coping strategies. Third, it estimates the impact of the coping strategies on livestock productivity and rural livelihoods. Hence, this paper provides promising research which could enhance the well-being of rural farm households dependent on livestock for food security and livelihood. </p> <p> <a href="#tbl1">Table 1</a> illustrates the trend in livestock assets in Pakistan. The number of cattle increased by 8% from 42.8 million in 2015/16 to 46.1 million 2017/18 and buffalo increased from 36.6 million to 38.8 million. The number of goat/sheep increased by 4%, from 101.1 million to 104.6 million. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span>  </div></p><p>Estimated livestock population in Pakistan (in millions).</p> [alt-text] Table 1 <table> <thead> <tr> <th /> <th>2015–16</th> <th>2016–17</th> <th>2017–18</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cattle</td> <td>42.8</td> <td>44.4</td> <td>46.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Buffalo</td> <td>36.6</td> <td>37.7</td> <td>38.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sheep</td> <td>29.8</td> <td>30.1</td> <td>30.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Goats</td> <td>70.3</td> <td>72.2</td> <td>74.1</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="table-wrap-foot_UNKNOWN"> <div class="fn-type-" title=""> <p>Source: Economic survey of Pakistan, 2016–17.</p> </div> </div>  <p /> </div> <div class="theoreticalframework" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Theoretical framework</div> <p> <a href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a> below depicts the flowchart of the conceptual framework. Data shows that climate change affects livestock production through a decline in feed and forage, water availability, heat stress and livestock diseases. As a result of this adverse effect, farm households adopt a number of strategies, such as livestock insurance, increasing the area for fodder, selling livestock, and migration to cope with the negative impacts of climate change. Those farm households who adopt strategies to cope with the adverse impacts of climate change on livestock are better off than those who do not. </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span> </a> </div>   <p>Conceptual framework.</p>   </div> <p /> </div> <div class="materialsandmethods" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">4</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Materials and methods</div> <p>The primary dataset was collected through a field survey of 700 livestock owners in 2017 from four major provinces (Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, and KPK) and AJK and Gilgit Baltistan. We used a comprehensive questionnaire covering a wide range of variables to collect the data. Prior to the implementation of the survey, we conducted a pilot test to validate the questionnaires. We followed multi-staged sampling. In the first stage we selected all four major provinces of Pakistan and AJK and Gilgit Baltistan. In the second stage, we selected <i>tehsil</i>/villages, and in the third stage we selected a farm household for the survey. <a href="#tbl2">Table 2</a> and <a href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a> below show the sampling methodology and distribution of the sample. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 2</span>  </div></p><p>Sample <i>tehsil</i>/village. </p> [alt-text] Table 2 <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Selected area</th> <th> <i>tehsil</i>/village </th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Sindh (90)</td> <td>Khan Garh, Hyderabad, Matiari, Kandiyaro, MoroRohri, Saleh Pat, Tando Allah yar, Kunri, Pithoro, Summaro, Umar Kot </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) (25)</td> <td>Bagh, Hattian Bala, Kotli, Muzaffarabad, Aath Maqam, Hajeera, Rawalakot, Palandri, Sadhnoti, Tarar khal </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gilgit Baltistan (35)</td> <td>Gilgit, Ali Abad, Sikandarabad, Chillas, Darail, Tangir</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Punjab (190)</td> <td>Kasur, Chinot, Bowana, Behra, Taxila, Shalimar, Okara, Depalpur, Tandalainwala, Sahiwal, Pakpatten, Arifwala, Burawala, Mian chanu, Kamalia </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Balochistan (110)</td> <td>Killa Abdullah, Gulistan, Killa Saifullah, Muslimbagh, Duki, Mekhtar, Bori, Kad Kocha, Dashat, Mastung, Pishin, Huramzai, Karezat, Zhob </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) (250)</td> <td>Tangi, Charsada, Mardan, Takhtbai, Katlang, Nowshara, Pabi, Peshawar, Topi, Swabi</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"> <a href="http://doi.org/"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 2</span> </a> </div>   <p>Map showing sample distribution.</p>   </div> <p /> <p>We used propensity score matching (PSM) methods to appraise the effect of climate-change risk-mitigating strategies on livestock productivity, household income, food security and poverty levels, as it controls for selection bias.

Descriptive statistics</div> <p>In <a href="#tbl3">Table 3</a> we present the description of the variables used in the analysis. The average age of the farmers was 47 years, and the mean livestock rearing experience was 28 years, which shows that the farmers were middle-aged and with a substantial amount of experience in farming. The mean age of the household head was 62 years, which means that the households are headed mostly by a senior member. Only in 43% of the cases, the farmer himself was the household head, which means the farmers are not necessarily the head of the household. About 64% of the farmers were married, and the number of members of the household stood at 9.28, which shows that family size was quite large. About 62 % were living in joint/extended family systems in which all the family members lived together, and generally, these were large families, compared to the nuclear family, typically comprising only husband, wife, and children. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 3</span>  </div></p><p>Description of variables.</p> [alt-text] Table 3 <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Variable</th> <th>Description</th> <th>Mean</th> <th>Standard deviation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <i>Demographic</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Age of farmer</td> <td>Age of the farmer (in years)</td> <td>47.00</td> <td>8.21</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Experience</td> <td>Experience in livestock rearing</td> <td>28.00</td> <td>5.89</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Age head</td> <td>Age of the household head (in years)</td> <td>62.00</td> <td>14.23</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Head relationship</td> <td>1 if farmer is himself head, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.43</td> <td>0.25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gender farmer</td> <td>1 if farmer is male, 0 female</td> <td>1.00</td> <td>0.00</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Married</td> <td>1 if farmer is married, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.64</td> <td>0.33</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Family size</td> <td>Number of family members living in the household</td> <td>9.28</td> <td>5.36</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Human capital</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Education</td> <td>Education of the farmer (in years)</td> <td>5.00</td> <td>2.76</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Land assets</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Owner</td> <td>1 if farmer is owner of land, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.46</td> <td>0.25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Land owned</td> <td>Land owned by the farmer (in hectares)</td> <td>2.14</td> <td>0.97</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fodder area</td> <td>Area allocated for fodder production (in hectares)</td> <td>0.36</td> <td>0.29</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Access to infrastructure and facilities</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Veterinary center</td> <td>1 if the village has veterinary center, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.27</td> <td>0.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Veterinary center benefitted</td> <td>1 if the farmer benefitted from veterinary center, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.44</td> <td>0.31</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Livestock helpline</td> <td>1 if the farmer benefitted from livestock helpline, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.07</td> <td>0.49</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AI facility</td> <td>1 if the farmer used AI facility, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.10</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Crop-livestock interaction</td> <td>1 if the farmer opted for the crop-livestock interaction, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.49</td> <td>0.26</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Fodder shortage</td> <td>1 if the farmer experienced fodder shortage, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.77</td> <td>0.23</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Farm and household assets</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tractor</td> <td>1 if the farmer owned a tractor, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.23</td> <td>0.11</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Car</td> <td>1 if the farmer owned a car, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.25</td> <td>0.24</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Television</td> <td>1 if the farmer owned a television, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.81</td> <td>0.50</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mobile</td> <td>1 if the farmer owned a mobile, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.92</td> <td>0.28</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Climate change experience and coping strategies</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Info climate change</td> <td>1 if the farmer had information about climate change, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.97</td> <td>0.55</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Update weather information</td> <td>1 if the farmer is following updates on weather information, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.63</td> <td>0.41</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Experienced climate change</td> <td>1 if the farmer is aware of climate change impacts, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.92</td> <td>0.38</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Insurance</td> <td>1 if the farmer opted for livestock insurance, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.21</td> <td>0.13</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Increase in fodder area</td> <td>1 if the farmer increased area for fodder, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.55</td> <td>0.26</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sold livestock</td> <td>1 if the farmer sold livestock at a lower price, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.14</td> <td>0.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Migration</td> <td>1 if the farmer migrated to other areas, 0 otherwise</td> <td>0.14</td> <td>0.07</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> <p>The mean years of schooling for the sampled farmers was five, which is within the national level. The average land owned by the sampled farm households was about 2.14 hectares; land holding size is comparatively low because the sampled households were livestock farmers who are mostly dependent on livestock rather than cropping. The area under fodder production was approximately 0.36 hectares, which is 17% of their total land holding. </p> <p>Though the sampled households were livestock-rearing farmers, only 27% of the villages had a veterinary center, 44% of the livestock farmers reported to have benefitted from veterinary services, and only 7% benefitted from the livestock helpline. Approximately 10% of the farmers have availed themselves of the artificial insemination facility for cattle. A large number of farmers reported that they experienced fodder shortages (77%), and 66% of the farmers have experienced various diseases in their livestock. </p> <p>Several questions on issues related to climate change were included. An overwhelming majority of the farmers (97%) reported that they had heard about climate change and 92% reported that they had experienced the impact of climate change. Despite being aware of climate change, only 63% were following weather updates. In the studied areas, farm households generally adopted four different strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change on livestock: increasing the area allocated to fodder (55%), opting for livestock insurance (37%), selling livestock (14%) and migrating (14%). Information on the number of households and farm-level assets was collected: about 23% of the households owned a tractor, 25% owned a car, 81% owned a television and 92% owned a mobile phone. According to the farmers, the severe climatic conditions during both summer and winter have affected milk and butter productivity. </p> <p>Information about livestock inventory is presented in <a href="#tbl4">Table 4</a>. Farm households kept cows for milk, meat and reproduction, which helped the growth of livestock assets. The average numbers of cows owned by the farmers was 2.39. Similarly, buffaloes were kept for milk and traction force, and the average number of buffaloes per household was 1.64. The average number of oxen owned by farmers was only 0.85 as they are kept for traction and meat, not milk. Sheep and goats are basically kept for meat and milk. The average number of sheep and goats per household is 5.09 and 7.75 respectively. The average numbers of donkeys, mules, and horses are 1.12, 0.57 and 0.35 respectively, and they are kept for carrying loads. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 4</span>  </div></p><p>Livestock inventory.</p> [alt-text] Table 4 <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Livestock</th> <th>Mean</th> <th>Standard deviation</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Cows</td> <td>2.39</td> <td>0.22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Oxen</td> <td>0.85</td> <td>0.25</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Buffaloes</td> <td>1.64</td> <td>1.28</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Sheep</td> <td>5.09</td> <td>2.53</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Goats</td> <td>7.57</td> <td>3.56</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Donkeys</td> <td>1.12</td> <td>0.95</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Horses</td> <td>0.57</td> <td>0.24</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mules</td> <td>0.35</td> <td>0.20</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>  <p /> </div> <div class="empiricalresultsanddiscussion" title="sec"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">6</span> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Determinants of livestock ownership</div> <p>The determinants of livestock ownership were estimated by employing the Poisson regression <a href="#fn1">1</a> model, and the results are presented in <a href="#tbl5">Table 5</a>. The dependent variable was the number of livestock owned by the farmers. The age coefficient is positive and significant at 1% level of significance, indicating that older farmers normally own more livestock. The family type was included as a dummy variable, i.e., 1 for the joint family and 0 for the nuclear family, and the coefficient is positive and significant, indicating that farmers living in a joint family normally keep a higher number of livestock. It may be due to the fact that joint families have surplus labor, which is needed to take care of the livestock. Likewise, the family size was positive and significant at 1%, which illustrates that households with more members rear more livestock because of the availability of the manpower needed to manage the livestock. <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN"> <span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 5</span>  </div></p><p>Determinants of livestock ownership (Poisson regression).</p> [alt-text] Table 5 <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Variable</th> <th>Coefficient</th> <th>t-value</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td> <i>Demographic</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Age (years)</td> <td>0.013***</td> <td>3.81</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Family type (dummy)</td> <td>0.01*</td> <td>1.73</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Family size (number)</td> <td>0.03***</td> <td>2.85</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Human capital</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Education (years)</td> <td>0.02***</td> <td>2.46</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Land assets</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Area for fodder (hectares)</td> <td>0.13***</td> <td>2.80</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Land entitlement (dummy)</td> <td>0.01**</td> <td>2.14</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Farm and household assets</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Tractor (dummy)</td> <td>0.005</td> <td>1.08</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Car (dummy)</td> <td>−0.07</td> <td>−1.22</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Television (dummy)</td> <td>0.13</td> <td>1.49</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mobile</td> <td>0.02***</td> <td>3.05</td> </tr> <tr> <td> <i>Access to facilities and infrastructure</i> </td> </tr> <tr> <td>Extension (dummy)</td> <td>0.02**</td> <td>2.30</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Met department (dummy)</td> <td>0.02</td> <td>1.43</td> </tr> <tr> <td>NGOs (Dummy)</td> <td>0.05</td> <td>0.93</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Constant</td> <td>0.04**</td> <td>2.18</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Number of observations</td> <td>700</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pseudo- <span class="inline-formula" title="inline-formula"> <div class="math_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mrow_UNKNOWN"> <div class="msup_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mrow_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mi_UNKNOWN">

Climatic-risk-coping strategies adopted by livestock farmers</div> <p>In the areas studied, the farmers generally adopted livestock insurance, the selling of livestock, the allocation of larger areas for fodder, and migration, as primary climatic-risk-coping strategies, which is used as the dependent variable. Migration was mostly forced due to drought, and livestock owners moved from one place to another in search of water and fodder. We employed a multivariate probit model because these four dependent variables are mutually inclusive, which means a farm household could use more than one climate-risk-coping strategy.

The ATT results show that farmers who adopted livestock insurance as a coping mechanism had a higher milk yield by up to 0.76 kg per day compared to the households who did not adopt it. The ATT results for the butter yield are also higher by up to 1.20 kg per month, and the ATT results for household income are higher by about 2,400 Pakistani rupees, a 5% level of significance. The ATT results for poverty are negative and significant indicating that the poverty level is up to 4% lower for those farm households who adopted the livestock insurance. With livestock insurance, farmers are able to obtain compensation for any damage resulting from climate shock; hence farmers with insurance have greater resilience. </p> <p>The PSM results for allocating more area for fodder are positive and significant for milk and butter production as well as household income, while it is negative and significant for poverty levels and livestock diseases. The ATT results for milk are 0.83 liters per day highlighting that the farmers who allocated more area for fodder were able to obtain higher milk production because of the availability of a sufficient quantity of diverse fodder and sufficient nutrients. The ATT results for butter yields are 1.55 kg per month, suggesting that butter production is more for households who allocated more area for fodder. The increase in butter may be due to increased production of milk. The ATT results show that household income levels are higher by up to 3,200 Pakistani rupees for this strategy, and the poverty levels are lowered by up to 4%. Increase in milk and butter production lead to an increase in income and reduction in poverty levels. The ATT results for livestock diseases demonstrate that disease levels are lowered by up to 15%, which may be due to the availability of required nutrients. </p> <p>The results regarding the selling of animals are negative and significant for milk and butter production while positive for household income. The results are negative for poverty and disease levels. When the household sells their livestock, it generates cash income in the short run, but in the long run, it reduces regular generation of income, which is evident from the fact that milk and butter production of the households who sold livestock as a strategy to cope with climate risk, is lower. </p> <p>In some areas, especially areas with less water, households use migration as a climate-change risk-mitigating strategy. The ATT results for the milk yield are negative and significant, demonstrating that migrant households have lower milk production by up to 0.62 kg/day. The butter production is negative and significant, with an ATT value of 0.25 kg/month. The household income is lower by up to 837 Pakistani rupees. Poverty and disease levels are higher. Hence migration should be the least favoured strategy to cope with climate risk. </p> <p>The results regarding the critical level of hidden bias and the numbers of treated and control groups are reported in <a href="#tbl7">Table 7</a>. The critical level of hidden bias indicates the level up to which the households which adopted the climate-change risk-management strategies and those who did not, differ from each other due to unobservable characteristics. </p> <p>As the main purpose of the PSM is to balance the covariates before and after matching, we employed a number of matching tests such as median absolute bias before and after matching, the value of <span class="inline-formula" title="inline-formula"> <div class="math_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mrow_UNKNOWN"> <div class="msup_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mrow_UNKNOWN"> <div class="mi_UNKNOWN">

Conclusions</div> <p>This research uses a rich primary dataset, collected from four major provinces of Pakistan and AJK and Gilgit Baltistan, to understand the climate risk faced by livestock farmers and the strategies adopted by them to cope with such risk. Even though livestock is an integral part of rural livelihoods and a large number of livestock farmers are facing climate risk, only a small number of villages have a veterinary center, and a limited number of farmers have benefitted from the meteorological department and livestock veterinary services. Under the changing climatic conditions, the land size, family size, and access to extension services positively influence livestock ownership in rural Pakistan. </p> <p>As climate change is threatening the livelihood of livestock farmers in Pakistan, farm households are adopting measures to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. Farm households in this study primarily implemented four main risk-coping strategies, which included livestock insurance, allocation of more area for fodder, selling livestock, and migration. </p> <p>We find that households with older heads tend to pursue selling livestock to cope with climate risk while households with younger heads are likely to go for livestock insurance, allocation of more area for fodder and migration. Households with larger families are less inclined to use livestock insurance and more inclined to sell livestock, allocate more land to fodder and migrate as strategies to cope with climate change. Households with a more educated head pursue livestock insurance, allocate more land for fodder and migrate to lessen the impact of climate change on livestock. Wealthier households who own land and have more land assets are likely to opt for livestock insurance, or the allocation of more land for fodder to manage climate risk and are unlikely to sell livestock and/or migrate. Households who are members of NGOs are likely to pursue all four climate-risk mitigating strategies while those with contact with extension services are more likely to sell livestock and/or allocate more land for fodder. </p> <p>The PSM results indicate that climate-risk-coping strategies have a positive impact on household welfare, as the adopters have higher milk and butter yields, as well as household incomes compared to non-adopters. Similarly, the incidence of poverty levels is lower for those households which adopt measures to mitigate the impact of climate change. As the adoption of a strategy to reduce the impact of climate change on livestock leads to the improvement in the well-being of rural families, policies should focus on implementing and strengthening measures, particularly livestock insurance and allocation of more land for fodder, to cope with climate risk. A policy such as training and education on climate risk, enhancing extension services and increasing asset endowments would support the mitigation of climate-change risk on livestock. </p> </div> <div class="declarations" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
