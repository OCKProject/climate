These populations have been exposed to new risks, mainly zoonoses, and given their socioeconomic living conditions, they have an increased risk of pathologies such as tuberculosis, Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), viral hepatitis B and C, viral respiratory infections, vector-borne diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis, food- and waterborne diseases including cholera, and an increased risk of antibiotic-resistant strains. In general, traditional epidemiological surveillance systems are not well-adapted to detecting emerging risks posed by climate change in the field of public health and climate refugees. Therefore, additional efforts will be needed to improve risk identification and assessment as it pertains to the different levels of climate management, be it environmental changes, population health impact, or health system status. Physicians should be trained to use efficient diagnostic and therapeutic management methods for these pathologies whose low frequency in our nonendemic regions make these pathologies exotic.
