<p class="p">The conditions in which refugees and migrants travel can acutely exacerbate or cause a life-threatening deterioration of their health. Elderly people and children are particularly vulnerable. Complications can result from physical injuries, loss of access to medication or devices, loss of prescriptions, lack of access to health care services leading to prolongation of disruption of treatment, and degradation of living conditions (loss of shelter, shortages of water and regular food supplies, and lack of income add to physical and psychological strain). Additionally, interruption of care due to destruction of health infrastructure, disruption of medical supplies, and the absence of health care providers, including interruption of power supplies or safe water resources, especially for people with end-stage renal failure who require dialysis, must be anticipated. A fundamental principle to remember, protecting the health of migrants, especially the most vulnerable populations, must be a priority. </p>
