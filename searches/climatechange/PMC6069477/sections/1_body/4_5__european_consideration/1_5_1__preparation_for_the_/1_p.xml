<p class="p">Climate change is widely regarded as a contributing factor for natural disasters, for the geographic redistribution of infectious diseases (particularly zoonotic ones), and for the increase in chronic diseases as well as other health hazards. Some of these risks have been highlighted in various reports for most developed countries as well as for some developing countries [
 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Using these risks as a template, organizational innovations as well as novel implementation strategies should be proposed to mitigate the disruptive effects of these health risks on EDs and by extension, reduce the negative impact of climate change on the populations they serve. A growing body of analysis is providing strong evidence to develop and support policies for managing and protecting public health from meteorological disasters [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. In this context of ongoing preparations to face the impact of climate change, experience gained from previous extreme climate events is already being put to use. For example, in Taiwan, a proper prehospital transportation plan for emergency medical services (EMS), in the event of burdensome numbers of casualties resulting from extreme climate events, was conceptualized after the 88 wind-caused disasters caused by Typhoon Morakot [

 <xref rid="B72-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. At present, there is a growing tendency to develop courses dealing with complex humanitarian emergencies [
 <xref rid="B73-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>], but this effort should be strengthened because of the rapid climate changes that are observed today. A recent review of literature regarding disaster preparedness provides evidence that there is a lack of readiness for disaster response in the hospitals and EDs that are on the front line to accommodate patients. The findings from this review highlight the benefits of further research and of provisioning for well-grounded disaster exercises that mimic actual events [
 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. A recent study of nurse interviews concerning prior disasters suggests that disaster preparedness education in nursing schools and in practice settings should include more hands-on exercises as well as specific policies on nursesâ€™ roles during disasters [
 <xref rid="B75-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. Emergency physicians and nurses are expected to provide effective services by using their professional expertise to reduce the risks posed by disasters. Thus, specific competencies are essential for coping with disasters and could be improved through education and training programs that enhance disaster preparedness [
 <xref rid="B76-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Active participation in simulation-based education should help to increase preparedness education. Large-scale disaster simulation exercises should be carried out and repeated every year with multidisciplinary team participation. This hypothesis is reinforced by a recent review that found a lack in training for disaster management, emergency communication, psychological first aid, public health interventions, disaster law and ethics, media handling, and humanitarian responses in an overseas setting [
 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Educational institutions and health and human service organizations must commit to increasing access to a variety of tested disaster-related educational programs for caregivers [
