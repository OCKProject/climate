<p class="p">Developing or resource-poor countries are the first victims of climate change, while their role in producing greenhouse gases is the weakest. A recent report [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] predicts that climate change will create economic winners and losers at both the individual and sectoral level, but developing countries will suffer disproportionately from rise in temperatures since they are situated in relatively hot climates. Within developing countries, the poor would likely be the most heavily affected by climate change. It is essential to support them in climate change prevention and response projects. The vulnerability of these countries is linked to a lack of financial resources, adequate and efficient technology, and effective institutions. More assistance for developing countries needing transfer of knowledge, technology and financial resources, and interventions promoting environmental/climate protection would help to promote adaption strategies among developing countries.
