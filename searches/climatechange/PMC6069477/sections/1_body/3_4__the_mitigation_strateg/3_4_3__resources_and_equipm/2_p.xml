<p class="p">Emergency services are experiencing a steady and significant increase in their activity and deterioration in their waiting times. ED length of stay has been associated with ED crowding [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], which is associated with decreased quality of care, increased occurrence of side effects, and dissatisfaction of patients and caregivers [
 <xref rid="B68-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. We consider that EDs will have to continue to carry out their conventional care missions and in addition, face the newly identified risks brought about by climate change. The challenges we face also represent an opportunity to question our understanding of the usual dysfunctions that plague EDs [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] and to ambitiously redefine ED quality and performance during crises. To this end, it is essential to review our current organizations and to implement quality improvement programs, strategies for simplification of care processes, and tools to reduce ED crowding [
 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Reducing crowding aims to achieve optimal functioning of Emergency Medical System (EMS) and EDs to ensure responsiveness to increasingly frequent and uncharted health crisis situations.
