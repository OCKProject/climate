 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. A recent study analyzed ambient temperature and added heat wave effects on hospitalizations in California from 1999 to 2009 [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. Positive associations with heat waves were found for acute renal failure, dehydration, respiratory disease, and respiratory disease with a secondary diagnosis of diabetes. For temperature, positive associations were observed for acute renal failure, appendicitis, dehydration, ischemic stroke, mental health, noninfectious enteritis, and primary diabetes.
