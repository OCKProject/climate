<p class="p">Observations since 1950 indicate increases in some forms of extreme weather events. Reports on Extreme Events and Disasters (SREX) by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicts further increases, including a growing frequency of heat waves, tropical cyclone intensity, and increasing intensity of droughts, rain, and floods [

A massive influx of these injured affected hospitals and healthcare facilities with an undeniable impact on the management of patient flows associated with emergency departments (EDs). In spite of existing plans for crisis management, developed countries will also be affected by these unusual phenomena. Thus, Florida and its EDs were also affected by the last hurricanes. Other phenomena also affect the global health system. The management of phenomena of this magnitude would require national or even international levels of intervention to support the affected countries. Habitually, this scale of management relies on military and civilian actors in emergency and humanitarian medicine. Although the management of such phenomena cannot be the sole responsibility of existing hospitals and of their EDs, the United Nations (UN) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as national organizations, will rely on available resources and healthcare personnel to respond to humanitarian disasters. There is also a need to strengthen support for hospitals and health care facilities in the least developed countries. Sometimes, it is a country that has to help its local region when the victim of a natural disaster, when a neighboring state is incapable of fighting alone against the sudden onset of a disaster. France, when faced with the violence of hurricane Irma, in September 2017, mobilized more than 400 local health professionals as well as tons of equipment to support the local health network in Saint-Martin (an island in the northeast Caribbean Sea). Thus, all hospitals could consider a building a system for rapid, flexible deployment of human and material means to better respond to the increase in natural disasters. In addition, it is important that the entire care network upstream and downstream of the hospital participates in this vigilance. The concept of a sentinel network in all its components is probably the best guarantee of rapid impact identification and the structured implementation of an adequate care response.
