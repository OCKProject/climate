<p class="p">All countries of the world will face a risk to their health care system. However, risks and their consequences are likely to be lessened in developed countries because of a more robust response capacity to adapt to these potential new risks [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Nevertheless, all of this depends on the ability to identify risks, organize response systems, and put in place procedures that reduce risks and their impact on the population [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Around the world, there are great disparities in hospital response, namely the percentage of countriesâ€™ health expenditure, bed density, the size and surface area of hospitals, the status of hospitals (public and private), hospital organization, and funding. Total health expenditure ranges from less than 1% to more than 17% of gross domestic product depending on the country. Around 40% of this goes to hospitals in developed nations. These differences already have a real impact on nonscheduled care (emergencies) on a daily basis. Climate change and disasters are likely to significantly highlight these disparities. In addition, affected populations may not be culturally prepared not only for these climatic changes, but also for intrinsic or external immune levels (vaccinations).
