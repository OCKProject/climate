<p class="p">Emergency caregivers are the first actors in the case of natural disaster or in the case of an increased influx of patients in the hospital with a quasi-systematic arrival in ED (emergency department). Consequently, emergency medicine and disaster medicine should be prepared to be active players in the planning to prevent and fight against the new risks linked to climate change. Based on the literature, the aim of this study is to identify the impacts of climate change on health and more specifically, on EDs. In light of the effects of climate change, specific strategies will be proposed to implement now and moving forward for EDs in Europe and internationally (especially in the less developed countries).</p>
