The human impact is linked to the accumulation of carbon dioxide and other pollutant gas emissions resulting from the use of fossil fuels, in turn responsible for an added greenhouse effect which has increased the temperature of the troposphere. In the absence of significant mitigating measures, its predicted evolution in the coming decades is worrying [
