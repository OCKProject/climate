<p class="p">Global warming is associated with other climate phenomena. The most prominent phenomenon is an exacerbation of the El Niño phenomenon, which affects wind patterns, sea temperatures, and precipitation. El Niño and La Niña correspond to the two opposite phases of the coupled ocean/atmosphere phenomenon called El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. This phenomenon, a source of origin of specific natural disasters, has already given rise to situations of humanitarian and health crises (e.g., in Haiti, Japan, and so forth). In addition to these situations that are at a city, regional, national, or even continental scale, climate change directly affects the health of the involved populations, especially the most vulnerable [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Environmental and meteorological changes impact air, water (drinking), and food quality and may be the greatest threat to the health system in crisis situations [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The direct consequence will be increased health risks with greater vulnerability and insecurity of the population’s water and food access, as well as a modified distribution of pathogens and associated vectors. These risks will be exacerbated with an increased frequency of extreme climatic events and would be compounded by increased migration phenomena and changes in agricultural production, ultimately resulting in a risk of undernutrition and civil disruption for a large part of the world population [
