 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]: reducing the production of greenhouse gases by limiting energy consumption and reducing the consumption of products with a high carbon footprint; the construction of buildings respecting the standards of sustainability, promoting clean and renewable energy and optimizing water-use efficiency and management; and fleet management by promoting the use of alternative fuel, electric, and zero-emission vehicles. Sustainability is also promoted by introducing new policies to achieve reduction in fuel use by decreasing the number of total vehicles in the motor pool, properly distributing newly acquired alternative fuel vehicles and encouraging ridesharing for employees who utilize fleet resources, sustainable acquisition models, pollution prevention and waste reduction, performance contracting, electronic stewardship and data centers, and to promote climate change resilience by incorporating climate adaptation and resilience solutions into the design of facilities through master planning.
