<p class="p">Human activity, directly and through the effects of induced climate change, is linked to changes in the ecosystem, such as changes in vector distribution, population susceptibility, and population exposure [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Climate change will also promote the embedding and development of invertebrate vectors. The risks for malaria, dengue and dengue hemorrhagic fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, Zika virus, West Nile fever, Lyme disease, and leishmaniasis will be increased in currently endemic areas, but also in areas that are currently free of malaria and these other infections [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Rodent-borne diseases may proliferate in this context, such as leptospirosis [
