<p class="p">Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency of violent phenomena such as the hurricanes and tropical storms that recently affected the Caribbean (Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September 2017). During periods of heavy rains and droughts, floods expose populations to the risk of drowning and traumatic pathologies: bruises, cuts or sprains, burns, electrocutions, snake bites, and wound infections [

The impact of the increase in traumatic pathologies has been described in tropical regions exposed to annual seasonal variations in rainfall. Both floods and droughts can coexist and succeed each other over time, increasing the risk of flooding and landslides. It is estimated that the frequency and intensity of storms and other occasional weather phenomena (very heavy rainfall and tornadoes, for example) increases with climate change. Areas that might seem less exposed to these phenomena, such as Europe, will be increasingly affected. Thus, it is estimated that in Europe, this risk will increase significantly in relation to climate change, and that mortality from traumatic causes may be significant [
