<p class="p">The changes in infectious disease are also indirectly linked to changing vectors patterns and increased risks of food- and waterborne diseases. Rising temperatures, flooding events, and abnormal water accumulation as a result of rainfall and stream overflows will result in changes in habitats, hibernation patterns, and the reproduction cycles of reservoir species. Additionally, migratory flows linked to climate change [
