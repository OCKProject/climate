<p class="p">The impact of extreme temperature variations on health has been documented in several international studies [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], such as those carried out in North America [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], Europe [

 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>], Asia [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], and Australia [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. They all describe a significant effect of heat waves on mortality and morbidity. The effects of heat waves on people are mediated by dehydration, both directly through heat stress and through exacerbation of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, renal, and respiratory illnesses. A Chinese study on heat-related illness described symptoms in cases of mild and severe illness [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Heat waves were defined as seven or more consecutive heat days with a maximum temperature over 35 °C. A positive association between maximum temperatures and occurrence of heat-related diseases was apparent. Mild illness symptoms are dizziness, headache, flushing, thirst, profuse sweating, weakness, palpitation, rapid pulse, attention deficit, loss of coordination, and body temperature ≥38.5 °C. Severe illness symptoms are heat stroke (including hot and dry skin, disturbance of consciousness, body temperature ≥40 °C), heat cramps (including muscle spasms with pain, usually in the calves, arms, abdominal wall, and back; altered consciousness; normal body temperature), and heat exhaustion (headache, sweating, thirst, nausea, vomiting, moist and cool skin, drop in blood pressure, tachycardia, mild dehydration, normal or slightly high body temperature).
