<p class="p">On respiratory implications, it has been shown that the frequency of ED admissions is increased for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) with an increase in pollution rates [

Many climate change effects are considered to have negative repercussions on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population [

Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory infections, and/or cold air inhalation, as well as other respiratory conditions, on the other hand [

Furthermore, among older adults, a recent and detailed study of the etiological climatic factors demonstrates that short-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 (particulate matter &lt;2.5 microns in diameter) is associated with more ED visits and hospitalizations for pneumonia, severe pneumonia, increased mortality, and increased health care costs. Exposure to other air pollutants (NO
