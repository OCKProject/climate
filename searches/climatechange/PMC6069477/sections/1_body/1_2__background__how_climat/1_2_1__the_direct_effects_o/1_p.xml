<p class="p">In developed countries, there have been several studies on the specific effects of extreme temperatures on stroke and cardiovascular events [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. A study conducted in 12 U.S. cities showed that the effects of temperature on hospital admissions predominantly occur within a few days after exposure [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. High temperatures cause blood vessels to dilate, which increases cardiac output and associated risks of decompensated heart failure [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Extreme temperatures cause stress on the cardiovascular system, with a higher risk of coronary diseases, especially in the elderly [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-01379" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In Vietnam, it was demonstrated that the average point of minimum admissions for cardiac diseases was at 26 Â°C. Rates of admission increased below this temperature point [
