<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Anthropogenic climate change is one of the greatest challenges the world is facing. According to the latest assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the likely global average temperature increase between the baseline period of 1986–2005 and 2081–2100 varies between 0.3 and 4.8 °C, with stronger increases on land compared with the ocean surface (

The projected temperature changes vary considerably depending on the respective greenhouse gas emission scenario (representative concentration pathways, RCPs) used for the climate model simulations, and with higher greenhouse gas concentration scenarios further warming is expected beyond the end of the century. Under the low-level emission scenario RCP2.6, the global mean temperatures might stabilize at a level that is ∼1.6 °C warmer in 2100 than during 1850–1900, while under a medium- to high-level emission scenario, such as RCP6.0, temperatures will continue to increase even beyond 2100, reaching a level of around 3 °C higher than the preindustrial period. Due to the expected severe consequences of even the medium climate change scenarios (

This Agreement, outcome of the Climate Summit in Paris in December 2015, aims for “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change” (
