<p class="p">For the geographical perspective, climate threat was quantified as the change in projected species richness per taxon, calculated as the differences in summed probabilities of occurrence between 1995 and 2080 from the SDMs (

 </ext-link>). For each time period the projected probabilities of occurrence of every species were summed, without prior thresholding and transfer to presenceâ€“absence matrices, to avoid the general overestimation of species richness (
 <xref rid="r64" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>). For each taxon, we then calculated the mean projected species richness change across the four different GCMs and the two SDMs. Land-use threat per grid cell was quantified as the mean change in percentage cover across the four GCMs between 1995 and 2080 for each of the three land-use types (bioenergy cropland, nonbioenergy cropland, pastures) (
