<p class="p">To assess future potential threats from the species perspective, we quantified the proportion of the current range of each species which is projected to overlap with any given threat (see above for the threat definition). While we excluded species with a range smaller than 10 grid cells from the SDM analysis, we still included these species in our study by assessing the spatial overlap of their ranges with areas of projected high climate and land-use change (see
