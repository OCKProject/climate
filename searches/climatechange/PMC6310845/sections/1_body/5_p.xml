<p class="p">Although the expansion of bioenergy cropland is a relatively recent phenomenon, impacts on biodiversity are already apparent. Depending on the prior land use, the effects are mostly negative, especially in tropical regions, where both flora and fauna become impoverished in oil-palm plantations used for bioenergy production relative to natural forests (
