<p class="p">As we expected, the discrepancy between the low- and high-emission scenarios in the high-threat areas is mainly due to differences in land-use change, and here mainly to the projected change in bioenergy cropland (

While we cannot precisely identify the areas where pastures or natural areas are turned into bioenergy cropland, we assume that a potential shift from pastures (which also include extensively used rangeland) to bioenergy cropland (for which we expect a higher cultivation intensity) will be particularly detrimental for biodiversity (
