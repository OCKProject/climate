<p class="p">The projected high impact of cropland change on biodiversity, under an extensive climate change mitigation strategy, is in line with numerous studies investigating local conflicts between biofuel expansion and biodiversity (
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>). Areas with high potential for bioenergy crops tend to overlap with areas of high biodiversity, as well as potential future climate refugia (

 <xref rid="r45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>). Subsequently, trade-offs between the protection of wildlife habitats, biodiversity hotspots, and other areas of conservation interest and the expansion of biofuel cropland, to mitigate climate change, are frequently unavoidable (

 <xref rid="r47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>). Although the impact of biofuel cropland expansion on biodiversity depends on a variety of factors as the regional context, location, previous habitat type, as well as the type of bioenergy cropland (
