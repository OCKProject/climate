<p class="p">Furthermore, under the low-emission scenario, many regions with extensive bioenergy cropland expansion coincide both with global hotspots of biodiversity and areas where species richness is projected to strongly decline because of direct impacts of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Impacted hotspots include the Atlantic Forest and the Cerrado in South America, Mesoamerica, and parts of western and eastern Africa. While projected changes in nonbioenergy cropland or pastures may also severely threaten species richness, especially under the high-emission scenario (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the extent of the area of any threat and of the area where different threats overlap is particularly large for the combination of bioenergy cropland and climate change (
