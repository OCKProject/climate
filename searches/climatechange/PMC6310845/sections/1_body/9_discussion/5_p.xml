<p class="p">This geographical pattern is mirrored by the species-based perspective; here the two scenarios showed the most pronounced differences in the high number of species likely becoming exposed to bioenergy cropland change across large proportions of their distributions under RCP2.6. Potentially even more worrying is the observation that under this low-emission scenario almost half of the smallest-range species (which could not be modeled using SDMs) occur in those areas where bioenergy cropland is projected to strongly increase (as single threat or as overlap with other threats). Most of these species are range-restricted amphibians occurring in Central America, the tropical Andes or the Atlantic Forest in South America, around Mount Cameroon in Africa or on Madagascar (
