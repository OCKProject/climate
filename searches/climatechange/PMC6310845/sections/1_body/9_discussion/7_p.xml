<p class="p">When comparing the patterns of changes in projected species richness between the two dispersal scenarios, direct impacts from climate change appear to decrease slightly when assuming that species can, to some degree, track areas that become climatically suitable (

 <xref rid="r53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>) and assessing to which extent these regions may be exposed to high levels of land-use change should be a high priority for global conservation efforts.
