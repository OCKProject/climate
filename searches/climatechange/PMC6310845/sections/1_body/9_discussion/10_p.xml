<p class="p">From a biodiversity perspective, the overarching goals of the Paris Agreement (
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>) are very much worth pursuing, as climate change remains one of the largest threats for global biodiversity. However, biodiversity is likely to suffer severely if bioenergy cropland expansion continues to play a major role in climate change mitigation efforts. Our findings highlight the urgent need to carefully consider biodiversity when expanding bioenergy cropland. On a more general note, an immediate and significant reduction in energy consumption to reduce the need for fossil fuel and bioenergy production appears to be challenging (
