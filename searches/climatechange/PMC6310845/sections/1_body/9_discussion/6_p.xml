<p class="p">Potential decreases of species richness due to direct impacts of climate change were larger under the high-emission scenario. However, regions with significant levels of potential species loss emerge already under the low-emission scenario. The relatively small differences between the scenarios and their consistent spatial patterns are probably due to the fact that even though by 2080 the scenarios differ in the global average warming by about 1 °C (RCP2.6: +1.64°; RCP6.0: +2.6 °C; both compared with the 1995 reference period), the climatic variables used for our SDM analysis show considerable changes also under the low-emission scenario (
