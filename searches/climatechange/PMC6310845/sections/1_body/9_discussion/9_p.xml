<p class="p">In a world of anthropogenic global change, interactive effects among different threats can be expected, including synergies and trade-offs (
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r54" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>). These interactions may vary under different scenarios of global warming: weaker direct impacts of climate change may be overruled by stronger effects of the mitigation efforts needed to combat global warming. Our analysis suggests that a low-emission scenario does not necessarily decrease the combined negative effects of climate and land-use change on biodiversity compared with a high-emission scenario, a finding consistent for both the geographic and the species-based perspectives (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Figs. 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">3</xref>). Importantly, the strong effects under the low-emission scenario are in fact due to efforts for climate change mitigation, namely to the massive expansion of bioenergy cropland. Averaging across the four GCMs we used for the low-emission scenario (RCP2.6) results in a global mean temperature increase of approximately 1.6 째C until 2080 compared with our 1995 baseline, which corresponds to an average warming level of approximately 2.1 째C compared with preindustrial conditions (

Keeping the warming level below 2 째C or even 1.5 째C likely requires even more mitigation efforts, such as additional expansion and intensification of bioenergy agriculture, with consequences for biodiversity that may be even more severe than those suggested by our analysis.
