<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">Our analysis demonstrated that the combined potential impacts of future climate and land-use change for global vertebrate species richness, measured as the area potentially impacted by either of the threats or their combinations, reach similar levels for the low- and the high-emission scenario. Furthermore, larger proportions of species distributions and more species with very small distributional ranges are likely impacted by multiple threats in the future under the low-emission scenario RCP2.6. For this scenario, a strong increase in bioenergy cropland may cause detrimental effects on biodiversity, which are not likely to be compensated by the slight reduction in direct impacts of climate change (compared with the RCP6.0 scenario). Overall, our findings suggest that a climate change mitigation strategy that largely relies on bioenergy crops may lead to impacts on biodiversity at least over similar geographical extents and for more of the species with the smallest geographical distributions under RCP2.6 than under RCP6.0.</p>
