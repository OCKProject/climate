<p class="p">Overall, a slightly larger number of species, of 15,448 species included in the SDM analyses, will potentially be affected by climate threat alone under RCP6.0 [14,989 ± 142 (SD)] than under RCP2.6 (14,855 ± 129), while a much larger number of species will potentially be affected by bioenergy cropland changes alone under RCP2.6 (10,346 ± 370) than under RCP6.0 (2,054 ± 279). Looking at the effects of climate threat and bioenergy cropland expansion (individually and combined), a slightly larger number of species will potentially be affected under RCP2.6 (15,309 ± 92) than under RCP6.0 (14,994 ± 140) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). For example, many more species may become directly impacted by climate change individually across larger proportions of their ranges (≥50%) under RCP6.0 (6,063 ± 634) than under RCP2.6 (3,884 ± 575). In contrast, under RCP2.6, 1,623 (±540) species are projected to experience a threat by bioenergy cropland alone within 10% or more of their current distribution, while under RCP6.0, only 3 (±2) species are projected to experience substantial impacts from bioenergy expansion (
