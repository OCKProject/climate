<p class="p">For the small-range species, similar numbers of species are projected to become exposed to any threat at a high-intensity level under both emission scenarios [RCP2.6 = 4,396 ± 113 (SD), RCP6.0 = 4,338 ± 78] (

However, while more species (1,995 ± 130) may become potentially impacted by climate change alone under RCP6.0 than under RCP2.6 (1,269 ± 118), a much larger number of species (2,310 ± 68) occurs in areas where bioenergy cropland is projected to increase under RCP2.6 than under RCP6.0 (107 ± 22) (alone or in combination with other threats) (
