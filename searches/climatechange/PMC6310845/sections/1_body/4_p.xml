Recent land-cover projections for the RCP2.6 emission scenario suggest an increase in the area of bioenergy cropland of more than 600 Mha worldwide until 2100. This equates to more than 4% of the global land area. In contrast, under RCP6.0, the simulated increase in bioenergy cropland is only marginal (
