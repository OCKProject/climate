<p class="p">Aside from climate change, biodiversity faces numerous additional anthropogenic threats. In general, land-use and land-cover change, accompanied by the destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of natural habitats, have been the most important drivers of past biodiversity change (

 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). However, it is now widely acknowledged that climate and land-use change interact, additively or synergistically, to affect biodiversity (
