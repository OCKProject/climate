<p class="p">Here, we aim to overcome these deficiencies by evaluating the potential future impacts of climate and land-use change on global species richness of terrestrial vertebrates using consistent climate and land-use impact projections from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>). We stack climate-based species distribution models to derive species richness estimates for the worldâ€™s amphibians, birds, and mammals. We then combine these with projections of land-use change to identify areas of high threat intensity (high climate or land-use change) and investigate whether these areas overlap in the future. Furthermore, we assess which proportions of species distributions are affected by the different threats, and quantify the number of threatened range-restricted species. We focus on two emission scenarios, and study differences in bioenergy cropland and other land-use types (nonbioenergy cropland, pastures). Under the low-emission scenario (RCP2.6) we expect weaker direct effects of climate change and, due to a dramatic increase of bioenergy cropland, stronger impacts of land-use change compared with the high-emission scenario (RCP6.0).
