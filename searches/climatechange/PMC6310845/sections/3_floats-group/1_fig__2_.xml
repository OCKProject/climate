The individual colors indicate the different threats (BC, bioenergy cropland; CC, climate change; CR, nonbioenergy cropland; PA, pastures) and the overlap between each of the threats (see Venn diagram for the color code). Results are shown individually for the three taxa and the two emission scenarios. The map shows the distribution of the threats that are defined for each variable as the (global) top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs, model types, and GCMs for climate change threat and the top quartile of cells with the highest mean change across RCPs and GCMs for land-use change threat (see

   </xref> for further details). For the bar chart, threat areas were identified individually for each of the eight model types Ã— GCM combinations for climate change threat and for each of the four GCMs for land-use change threat; the bar chart columns show the mean across these eight (four) combinations, with error bars indicating the SDs.
