 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. We developed multivariate climatic velocity for North and South America based on a principal components analysis of 37 bioclimatic variables, using data derived from ten GCMs for the SRES A2 emissions scenario [

 <xref rid="pone.0140486.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). We developed biotic velocity from multivariate climatic niche models for 2954 terrestrial species (1818 birds, 723 mammals and 413 amphibians) based on a previously-published analysis that projected shifts in the geographic distribution of climatic suitability from a current historical (1961–1990) to a future (2071–2100) habitat time period, based on the ten GCM projections [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. The hemispheric extent allowed us to compare the two metrics across a diverse set of biomes that vary widely in their climatic and biogeographic attributes. We also compared the distribution of disappearing climates and species.
