<p class="p">Several studies have determined that historical climatic velocity is correlated with past species range shifts [

 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In contrast to historical studies, forward-looking comparisons rely on projected range shifts as a response variable, which imperfectly represents the actual pattern of future species movements. However, comparison of biotic and climatic velocity based on future climate projections is critical in informing planners as to whether the higher level of model complexity represented by climatic niche models results in qualitatively different threat patterns and conservation priorities. For example, a strategy for identification and conservation of refugia [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] would be more complex if areas of low biotic velocity did not overlap with areas of low climatic velocity. In general, consideration of a suite of climate-related metrics results in more robust threat assessments than could a focus on any one measure in isolation [
