<p class="p">The vulnerability of major protected areas also differed between climatic regions (
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.g006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). Equatorial protected areas were highly vulnerable from the perspective of both forward and backward biotic velocities as well as forward climatic velocity. North temperate protected areas showed greater threats from forward than backward velocity. Arctic (polar) protected areas showed a wide range of vulnerability to both climatic velocity and forward biotic velocity.
