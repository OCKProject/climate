<p class="p">Our hypothesis that future projected climatic velocity would peak in boreal regions was not supported. Our results instead suggest that areas of high future climatic velocity will not be confined to areas such as the boreal region which have experienced high climatic velocity in the past, but will extend into equatorial regions which have previously experienced low climatic velocity [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Previous studies have proposed that the narrower thermal tolerances of tropical organisms make them most vulnerable to climate change despite a lower absolute magnitude of climate change in tropical regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. In our results, however, threats to equatorial species arise from both the future magnitude of exposure to climatic change (climatic velocity) and the narrow climatic tolerances of species in these equatorial regions, which currently experience low seasonal and interannual climatic variability [
