<p class="p">Biotic velocity is similar to climatic velocity in that it synthesizes a large volume of data into a single metric that facilitates comprehension of common patterns across a range of variables. The contrasts in vulnerability between climate zones we observed appear robust in that they are not driven by a few highly vulnerable species (
