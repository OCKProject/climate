<p class="p">When seen in this framework, the velocity metrics considered here provide complementary sources of information for threat assessment and conservation planning under climate change. To provide informative results, the analog-based climatic velocity method must use a relatively narrow range of climatic conditions to define what constitutes a “match” between current and projected future climates. Climatic velocities therefore represent an upper bound of migration requirements because they effectively assume negligible climatic tolerances or adaptive capacities of populations inhabiting a site.</p>
