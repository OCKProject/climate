<p class="p">We used a direct estimate of climatic velocity, or the distance between a location and the nearest location with analogous climate in the future [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Climate analogs were identified using multivariate Euclidean climate distance estimated from the first 5 axes of a principal components analysis of the 37 bioclimatic variables. Use of multivariate Euclidean distance based on PCA scores reduced the effect of collinearity between bioclimatic variables and approximated a Mahalanobis distance based on the original set of variables.
