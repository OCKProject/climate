<p class="p">Conservation planners have long realized that any one metric or set of targets can serve as only an imperfect surrogate for the larger goal of biodiversity conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0140486.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Our results suggest that geographic patterns of vulnerability to climate change differ depending on whether conservation of locally-adapted populations, species, or sites is of primary interest. This contrast should be considered when identifying areas which may function as refugia or conversely are likely to be at high risk of biodiversity loss under climate change.
