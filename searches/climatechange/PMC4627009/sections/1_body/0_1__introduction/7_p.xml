<p class="p">For example, the way and what we eat, how we work predominantly in cities at sedentary tasks, and transport ourselves with little physical effort, not only damages our health but also harms the planet. Some common vectors of NCDs and climate change are seen in links between greenhouse gas emissions and body mass index [

 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. There are also reports that soil degradation resulting from mass food production and poor land management is depleting the micro-nutrient content of fruit and vegetables [

A more direct link between climate change and NCDs is the increased incidence of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses caused by air pollutionâ€”air pollution being both
