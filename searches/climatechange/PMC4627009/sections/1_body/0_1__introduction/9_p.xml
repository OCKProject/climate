<p class="p">The available literature on health and climate change is largely confined to “issues-raising” expert opinion and commentary; estimates and modelling; and reviews of non-empirical work and the “grey literature”. Such contributions are clearly important [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] but have not yet translated into comprehensive systematic, evidence-generating enquiry and there has been little emphasis on combining legal and public health thinking and solutions at the interface between NCDs and climate change [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Nor have the “health in all policies” [
 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and health impact assessment [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] movements yet successfully bridged this divide or integrated with environment impact theory and practice, although this may be imminent [
