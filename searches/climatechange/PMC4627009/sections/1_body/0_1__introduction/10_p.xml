<p class="p">As pointed out by Haines and McMichael [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], the clear definition of precisely what needs to be researched is hindered by uncertainties about the exact nature and rate of climate change and the sheer magnitude and complexity of the systems, sectors and politics involved. McMichael also detailed the challenge elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], especially the need for new research methods and models and the imperative to stop applying old thinking and tools to new and unchartered problems. To deal effectively with complex issues, Finegood 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-12-12941" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] advised that “
 <italic class="italic">…we need to move from an analysis of the determinants or causes of the problem to a solution orientation; the frameworks used to describe the problem may not be the right ones for building the "best" solutions</italic>”.
