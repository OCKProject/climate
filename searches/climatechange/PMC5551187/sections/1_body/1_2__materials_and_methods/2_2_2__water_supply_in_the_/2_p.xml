<p class="p">In rural areas, surface water (streams and rivers) and groundwater (borehole and hand-dug well) are the main sources of water available to communities. Traditionally, communities in rural areas depended largely on surface water from streams and rivers, but there is a growing trend for more reliance on borehole water in rural areas. This is due to the negative effects of pollution and droughts on the quality and quantity of surface water resources, and the efforts of the government of Ghana, led by Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA) in partnership with NGOs, which have seen boreholes installed in most villages in the Municipality. Evidence suggests that this trend, away from the use of surface water sources, has reduced the incidence of water-related diseases in the Municipality [

However, despite the provision of boreholes, villages are still vulnerable to water shortages and water-related diseases due to the vagaries of the weather. Given the seasonal changes in water source quality and availability, most households depend on a mix of surface and groundwater supply systems depending on the geographical location.
