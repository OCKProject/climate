 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Within the Bolgatanga Municipality, households in the core of the three urban areas (Zuarungu, Sumbrungo and Bolgatanga) depend largely on piped water, supplied and managed by the Ghana Water Company Limited, (Bolgatanga, Ghana). In contrast, households in the peri-urban areas depend on boreholes and hand-dug wells, as these areas are not yet connected to the piped water system.
