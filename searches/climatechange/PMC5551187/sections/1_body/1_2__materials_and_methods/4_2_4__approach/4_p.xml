This enabled us to classify each interview script into parts that could then be treated as distinct units for thematic analysis. Qualitatively, each theme was evaluated to identify which of the themes most frequently occurred, in what perspective and how they are linked to each other. Some respondent’s answers were directly quoted to emphasize the argument being put forth around these emergent themes. Finally, we also obtained secondary information, to build on the stakeholder interviews, from the Municipal Medium-Term Development Plans, Municipal Annual Budgets, and Municipal Annual Reports.
