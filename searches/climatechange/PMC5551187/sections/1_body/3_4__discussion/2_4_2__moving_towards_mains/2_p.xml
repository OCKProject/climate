 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00749-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> presents a conceptual model for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into development planning. The model presents two pathways; the normal processes of adaptation and the adaptation induced by planning. In the normal process (shown by the red arrows), climate change impacts are influenced by both adaptation and mitigation [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], although the focus of this model is on the adaptation component. It is important to note that adaptation may be reactive or anticipatory [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and that decisions and outcomes will be influenced by vulnerability, which is a function of the adaptive capacity, sensitivity and exposure of the system.
