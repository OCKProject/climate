<p class="p">There are currently virtually no structures put in place to mainstream climate change and mainstreaming cannot take place in an institutional vacuum. Therefore, it is recommended that administrative and governance structures through the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development (MLGRD) should create desk offices for climate change particularly at the district levels that will be in-charge of integrating and coordinating climate change adaptation issues across all sectors of the Assembly. The desk officers will ensure effective collaboration between the various stakeholders including governmental, non-governmental and decentralised departments.</p>
