<p class="p">As indicated by Huq and Ayers [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], the mainstreaming process should begin with building awareness and capacities of all stakeholders involved in the management of resources in the Municipality. Therefore, it is recommended that the local government should organise training sessions on climate change adaptation for Municipal Assembly staff, decentralised departments, NGOs and community elders. Through these training workshops, stakeholders will be trained on how to effectively mainstream climate change issues at the local levels which are then harmonised and coordinated at the regional level and up into the national plans i.e., the NMTDPF. This will ensure a move away from the traditional top-down approach to the mainstreaming of cross-cutting issues including climate change.
