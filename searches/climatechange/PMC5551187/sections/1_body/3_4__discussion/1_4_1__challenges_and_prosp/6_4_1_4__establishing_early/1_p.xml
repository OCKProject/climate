<p class="p">The lack of early warning systems and disaster risk readiness has further weakened the adaptive capacity of the Municipality. Hence, to ensure effective mainstreaming, decisions must be based on climate change information that is reliable and represents a continuous assessment of climate threats, exposures and sensitivities. It is also vitally important that this information is broadly and clearly communicating to support and inform local level adaptation. The Municipality should invest in the development of early warning systems and awareness programmes, to ensure that stakeholders have easy access to relevant information around system specific climate change threats or disaster risks.</p>
