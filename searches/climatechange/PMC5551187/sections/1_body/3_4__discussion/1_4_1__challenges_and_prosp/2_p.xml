<p class="p">There are many barriers which prohibit the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation issues into WaSH development plans in the Bolgatanga Municipality. First, there is inadequate information about the Municipalityâ€™s vulnerability to climate change and its hazards. Second, there are no institutional structures in place to mainstream climate change adaptation into the Municipal Assembly plans and there is no coordination and collaboration between stakeholders in the Municipality, making advocacy and coordination of climate change issues difficult. It was also observed that WaSH professionals in both governmental and non-governmental organisations were interested in building WaSH facilities and not really concerned about the impact of climate change on these facilities, probably due to the inadequate knowledge in climate change issues. This could also be exacerbated by politics, where the government is mostly interested in commissioning boreholes and toilets constructed for political gains. Also, livelihood interventions were mainly carried out by few of the decentralised institutions and these interventions were mostly sponsored by external donors. There is a growing concern that the sustainability of these projects, or lack thereof, will become a problem after the sponsors have left. On the basis of suggestions from the key stakeholders in the WaSH sector interviewed in this study, the following strategies are recommended to support the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into WaSH development planning for the Bolgatanga Municipality.</p>
