<p class="p">At the national level, climate change has been incorporated into the national development policy. The approach to this incorporation has been top-down in nature and at the local level, there is no legislative support for mainstreaming climate change. Therefore, it is recommended that the government, through legislation, should oblige MMDAs to allocate a certain percentage of their revenue or the DACF to fund climate adaptation initiatives.</p>
