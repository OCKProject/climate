 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. Interestingly, there is evidence of this strengthening occurring in Bolgatanga, with stakeholders who attended more climate change capacity-building programmes indicating that they had begun to incorporate climate change adaptation measures into their planning processes. However, it is also important to note that some stakeholders are not fully aware of the adaptation measures being implementedâ€”many of them said that the Municipal Assembly should be contacted regarding climate change adaptation issues. This might be attributed to a lack of institutional coordination and collaboration, particularly at the Municipal level. The risks associated with poorly coordinated approaches to adaptation are that maladaptive measures may be implemented, as the actions at one level might have negative consequences at other levels of the system.
