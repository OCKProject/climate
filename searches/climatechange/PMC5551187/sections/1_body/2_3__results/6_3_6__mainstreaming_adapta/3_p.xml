<p class="p">Municipal Development Plans represent an access point through which climate change adaptation can be mainstreamed. The Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) prepared by the Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs) in Ghana is used as a working document responding to the development challenges of the area for a period of time. The MMDAs are required to develop their action plans to harmonize with the National Medium Term Development Planning Framework (NMDTPF). This means that the Assembly’s development plans and budgets should be in sync with the seven thematic areas of the NMTDPF, which includes crosscutting issues such as climate change, gender and disability. For the Bolgatanga Municipal Assembly, the MTDP for 2014–2017 based on the Ghana Shared Growth Development Agenda (GSGDA) is yet to be finalized [

This therefore presents an opportunity for the Municipality to capture and highlight the emerging climate change and WaSH issues and to mainstream them into the plan. Taking these types of opportunities is really important, as failure to recognize these important issues will result in a lack of resources to support adaptation and mainstreaming efforts. For example, analysis of the Composite Budget of the Bolgatanga Municipal Assembly for the 2015 Fiscal Year indicated that there was no direct climate change adaptation strategy to be followed in response to prevailing or anticipated climate change impacts. Moreover, there were seven projects related to environment, water and sanitation from the 2015 budget. These projects included public education on environmental cleanliness, monthly clean up exercises, improvements to waste management, support for soil improvement activities, provision of boreholes to communities, installation of small town water systems for selected communities and the construction of water closets and KVIP toilets [

In the view of the Environmental Health and Sanitation Unit (EHSU), climate change issues were completely missing in the 2015 Budget. The EHSU stakeholder clarified further that, aside from the small number of environmental issues captured in the 2015 Annual Action Plan; there was no talk about climate change in the plan.
