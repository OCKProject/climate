<p class="p">The stakeholder from Water Vision Technology agreed with the assertion that climate change was absent in the budget and hence tried to differentiate between environmental concerns and climate change issues. The institution emphasized that it is hard to dissociate climate change adaptation measures from measures pursued to improve the environment and added that the difference depends on the reasons behind the development of these measures. Hence, adaptation measures are intended to mitigate particular impacts of climate change and increase resilience against some forms of vulnerabilities. On the other hand, environmental measures are targeted at tackling particular environmental issues such as land degradation, which may not be specifically caused by climate change. It is important to add that climate change is likely to make environmental problems worse, which in turn suggests that mainstreaming is still required.</p>
