<p class="p">Though institutional capacity is important for mainstreaming climate change adaptation into policy planning, it is not limited to only capacity building. It is also important to develop and strengthen the structures for institutions to handle climate change issues. The necessary institutional arrangements required for mainstreaming climate change have not yet been implemented by the Municipal Assembly. In addition, it is clear that climate change issues are added to existing roles and responsibilities, as neither the Assembly nor the decentralized departments had a desk officer or focal person in charge of climate change issues.</p>
