<p class="p">Climate change vulnerability assessments predict both the current and future effects of climate change, the vulnerabilities of communities and ecosystems to these effects, and the measures that support adaptation to all the impacts [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. Climate change vulnerability assessment is crucial in designing adaptation measures, particularly in communities where livelihoods are predicated on natural resources such as water and ecosystem resources. The failure to undertake vulnerability assessments will affect capacities to adapt to climate change impacts. This is clearly the case in the Bolgatanga Municipality, as it is evident that vulnerability assessment and WaSH delivery in the Municipality remains a great challenge. While some of the stakeholders indicated that climate change vulnerability has not been assessed, others are uncertain about whether this activity has been carried out (

They advised that departments directly involved in WaSH activities should be contacted for further information on climate change vulnerability assessment. The stakeholders who agreed that climate change vulnerability assessment had been carried out, could not measure or articulate the outcome of the assessment (

 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], who stated that integrating climate change adaptation into mainstream development policy at the local level is less of a priority than the national-level initiatives. In a related way, the United Nations Environment Program-United Nations Development Program (UNEP-UNDP) Povertyâ€“Environment Initiative [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>] suggested that awareness and institutional capacity building are key entry points to begin climate change mainstreaming. It is important to note that support for institutional capacity, particularly for mainstreaming cross-cutting issues such as climate change, is yet to be achieved in the Bolgatanga Municipality.
