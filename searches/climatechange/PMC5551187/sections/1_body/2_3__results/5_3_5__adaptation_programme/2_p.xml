<p class="p">Questions regarding the resourcing of adaptation programmes revealed that the main source of funding for adaptation activities for the Municipal Assembly were from the Internally Generated Funds (IGF), whereas funding for the decentralised departments and their activities were mostly from donor agencies. This leads to some lack of coordination in adaptation response. For example, there was no alternative livelihood programme implemented by the Municipal Assembly to adapt to climate change, whereas programmes in this space were promoted by institutions such as WRC and EPA and mainly sponsored under development assistance.</p>
