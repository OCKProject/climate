<p class="p">The main adaptation programmes cited by stakeholders included the opening of drainages, dredging and rehabilitation of dams, clean-up campaigns and use of drought resistant crops. These measures are implemented by the Bolgatanga Municipal Assembly in response to the current threats, including the impacts of climate change. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has implemented related programmes of work which seek to diversify livelihoods from traditional agriculture to other ventures, restore riparian buffer zones and tree planting activities. Some of these activities, like riverbank restoration and riverbank alternative livelihood support are also undertaken, separately, by the Water Resources Commission (WRC). Despite these efforts towards addressing and adapting to climate change, there are still gaps to be addressed mainly because the programmes and projects lack proper coordination at the assembly level. While some stakeholders could not mention any adaptation measures put in place by the Municipal Assembly as a whole, others felt that coordination of these programmes at the assembly level was either poor or non-existent.</p>
