<p class="p">The lack of administrative structures to support climate change adaptation, as reported by the stakeholders, makes it difficult for climate issues to be considered in policy discourse. As mentioned previously, stakeholders suggested that District Assemblies need to have climate change desk officers who will advocate and coordinate climate change adaptation issues. The stakeholders argued that gender and disability issues have been successfully mainstreamed because there are administrative and governance structures supporting them. In this sense there is a case for a closer examination of the mainstreaming of gender and disability issues, in order to learn about the approaches that have been taken and to adopt one that will most likely be successful for achieving the climate change adaptation mainstreaming.</p>
