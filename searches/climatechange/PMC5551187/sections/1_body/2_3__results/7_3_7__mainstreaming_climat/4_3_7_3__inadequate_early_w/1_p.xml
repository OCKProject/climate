<p class="p">It is very important to share meteorological information, including climate change projections to communicate reliable information on weather conditions and threats. This is very relevant for monitoring specific climate change stressors such as floods and drought and enables the preparation of early warning measures necessary for households and farmers. An example of this comes from NADMO, who mentioned that every year, at the beginning of the rainy season, they sensitize communities in the Municipality about potential risks such as floods. This was confirmed by the Municipal Planning Unit in a similar claim that households are usually informed through announcements on radio stations particularly about the opening of the Bagre Dam Spillway in Burkina Faso, so that they can prepare against the potential risks.</p>
