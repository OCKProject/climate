<p class="p">A number of challenges regarding the mainstreaming of climate adaptation into WaSH development planning were identified during the stakeholder interviews. These comprised the non-existence of institutional structures and constitutional support, lack of coordination and collaboration, inadequate information on the districts vulnerability to climate change, inadequate early warning system strategies and the trivializing of climate change issues. These challenges arise because different institutions are responsible for different aspects of the environment without proper institutional coordination at the decision making and policy implementation levels. All of these issues highlight how Ghanaâ€™s climate change adaptation behaviour is typical of a developing country with poor adaptive capacity and low political influence and will.

These dialogues provide a common platform to discuss the impact of climate change in the northern part of Ghana and represent an opportunity for building understanding and capacity and this is an important first step towards mainstreaming.
