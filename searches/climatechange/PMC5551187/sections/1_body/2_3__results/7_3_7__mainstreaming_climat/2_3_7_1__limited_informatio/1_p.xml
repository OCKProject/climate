<p class="p">Stakeholders identified that information, particularly scientific information, was virtually not available in the Municipality. Though climate change issues such as flooding and drought are a perennial issue in the Municipality, there has not been any vulnerability assessment in the area not has there been shared information on likely climate driven changes in intensity and frequency of these events. The NGOs interviewed indicated that they did not have any scientific information to enable discussion of the specific areas of the district that are vulnerable to climate change. The Municipal planning unit and the EPA also indicated that there has never been any assessment of the districtâ€™s vulnerability to climate change. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) agree that effective planning is reliant on the understanding of what is been planned and considering climate change adaptation, a risk assessment of current and future impacts of climate change and vulnerability conditions is critical in enabling adaptation and building resilience [
