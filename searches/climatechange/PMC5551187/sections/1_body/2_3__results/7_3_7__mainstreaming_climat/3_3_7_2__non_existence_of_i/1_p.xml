<p class="p">Establishing institutional structures is key in advancing the mainstreaming of climate change adaptation. In the National Medium Term Development Plan Framework (NMTDPF), cross-cutting issues such as gender and disability have been identified, together with climate change, to be mainstreamed into the District Medium-Term Development Plans (DMTDP). While gender and disability have been mainstreamed into the administrative structures of the Assembly, climate change is yet to receive such support. The EHSU and CWSA stakeholders suggested that the Municipal Assembly needs to have a climate change desk officer to promote and coordinate climate change issues. Furthermore, there has not been any statutory support for the mainstreaming of climate change and this is not only at the district levels but the national level as well [

In the Bolgatanga Municipal Action Plans, there have been no specific funds allocated to support climate change adaptation programmes. This is, in part, due to the fact that the Assembly, by law, is not obliged to devote any funds to climate change. As a result, mainstreaming climate change issues into development planning is left as a choice in the Municipal Development Planning Agenda. The EHSU and CWSA contended that without a law obliging the District Assemblies to include climate change issues and threats, this will remain an issue for discussion without concrete actions to address it. The GWCL indicated that statutory support should be created to allow the district assemblies to commit a percentage of the District Assembly Common Fund (DACF) to fund climate change adaptation, just like the two percent allocation currently permissible for disability projects. GWCL added that unless this is done climate change issues will always be underestimated and will remain under resourced at the district level.
