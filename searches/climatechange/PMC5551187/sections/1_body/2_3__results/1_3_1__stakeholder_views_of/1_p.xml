 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00749-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) and reported that the Municipality has been experiencing greater than expected variability in rainfall and higher temperatures, especially during extreme events. These changes in rainfall patterns, decreasing water quantity in streams and rivers and increasing temperatures were the most common climate change stressors in the Municipality. These stressors included heavy downpours causing floods or long dry spells resulting in droughts that often decrease the quantity of water in rivers, streams and lakes. The stakeholders indicated that there has also been a reduction in the predictability and reliability of seasonal weather patterns, to the point that flood or drought events can now occur at any time of the year. In general, the stakeholders expressed the view that climate change had led to the rapid depletion of natural resources due to farming activities, overgrazing, improper solid and liquid waste disposals, illegal mining and other anthropogenic activities around the Volta Basin. As mentioned by one of the stakeholders, “Due to the impact of climate change, people have turned to exploiting the ecosystem there by depleting natural resources”.
