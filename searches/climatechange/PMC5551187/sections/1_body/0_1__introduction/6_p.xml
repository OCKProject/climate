<p class="p">The widespread support for the concept of mainstreaming provides an opportunity for us to examine the degree to which climate change adaptation has been, or could be, mainstreamed into WaSH development planning in developing countries like Ghana. To date, integration of climate change into development programmes in Ghana has only been considered at the national level [

 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], noted, climate change adaptation and its integration has only become a recent issue for policy-makers and planners in Ghana and its mainstreaming remains a challenge. Given this context, we explore the extent to which climate change adaptation measures are being mainstreamed into the WaSH development plans for sustainable development for the Bolgatanga Municipal Assembly, in northern Ghana. To do this, we interviewed government and NGO stakeholders and used a standardized questionnaire to gather information around WaSH development, climate change threats and risks and coordination of responses across all stakeholder groups. Based on our findings, we provide an approach which will aid in the conceptualization and mainstreaming of climate change adaptation into future WaSH policy, planning and implementation in the region.
