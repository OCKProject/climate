<p class="p">Climate change has become one of the major issues threatening sustainable development in the world. Changes to weather patterns, including the reliability and predictability of seasonal rainfall and the impacts of extreme events, now place unprecedented pressures on water resources, especially in flood- and drought-prone regions of the globe. These growing water resource challenges make sustainable development objectives, especially those directly relating to water, sanitation and hygiene (WaSH) targets, even more difficult to achieve [

Whilst significant levels of investment in WaSH in sub-Saharan Africa have achieved significant results during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) period, the pressure of climate change threatens to undo previous interventions and hamper the continued progress that is required to satisfy the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda [
