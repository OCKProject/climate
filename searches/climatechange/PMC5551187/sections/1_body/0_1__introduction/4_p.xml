<p class="p">Despite the recent climate events and the future projections for the climate, measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change in Ghana have been ad hoc (reactive) and largely in response to emergencies. As a result, the long-term consequences of climate change, and the associated anticipatory adaptation required to respond to these changes [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], are barely considered. Incorporation of adaptation measures into plans, programmes, projects and budgets can reduce the adverse impacts of climate change on the sustainability of development programmes and projects [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In this way, development interventions can become resilient through climate-proofing [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. In a similar way, peopleâ€™s adaptive capacities, particularly through their WaSH practices, can be improved and their vulnerability levels reduced through the integration of climate change adaptation into development plans [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-14-00749" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Accordingly, there is a need to plan appropriately and pragmatically to embrace a development pathway that ensures resilience and incorporates climate change adaptation issues into all aspects of WaSH Sector development planning. Like many other developing countries, the challenge now lies with moving away from focusing solely on disaster and emergency WaSH relief, towards a forward-thinking strategic approach to WaSH development that is climate-resilient [
