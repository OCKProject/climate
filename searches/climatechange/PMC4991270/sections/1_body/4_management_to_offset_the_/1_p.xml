 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Rising sea levels affect the extent and quality of coastal habitats through erosion and changes in niche availability and increase the vulnerability of inland habitats to seawater flooding. There are particular problems where coastal development and construction of hard defences prevent landward migration of habitats, resulting in them being squeezed between a fixed landward boundary and rising sea levels (Morris

 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> management in response to these threats, it is worth emphasizing that such management should sit alongside landscape approaches, because even modest coastal development can alter natural coastal dynamics over hundreds of kilometres (Hapke, Kratzmann &amp; Himmelstoss
