<p class="p">Soft‐sediment intertidal habitats are able to accrete vertically and maintain their elevation with respect to rising sea levels if there is a sufficient supply of sediment and conditions are suitable for settlement (Krauss

 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Structures such as groynes and brushwood fences have been used to interrupt the movement of sediment and encourage local deposition, therefore increasing habitat extent by widening beaches (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). However, if insufficient sediment is available to maintain habitat extent, additional material can be added to the system. For example, material from dredged sites can be added to beaches or eroding saltmarshes to increase the width and/or surface elevation, which may have the added benefit of increasing plant above‐ground biomass, which in turn can stabilize the saltmarsh surface (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The source of the sediment for such nourishment schemes is an important factor. Fine‐grained material is more likely to be resuspended and washed away and the form of benthic invertebrate communities is highly dependent on the grain size of the added material (Bolam &amp; Whomersley
