 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> management to offset the effects of sea‐level rise depends mainly on the habitat type in question. Freshwater and brackish habitats, such as saline lagoons, require protection from tidal inundation because species are vulnerable to increases in salinity, which can lead to shifts in community composition (Tate &amp; Battaglia 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Where landward retreat of these habitats is not possible due to adjacent land use, protection from saline flooding by the maintenance of hard or natural defences (e.g. sand or shingle barriers) is likely to be most effective. For example, sea walls at RSPB Titchwell, Norfolk, UK, were replaced or strengthened to protect important freshwater habitats, as part of a package of measures aimed at adapting the reserve to rising sea levels (RSPB
