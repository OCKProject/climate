<p class="p">Mean temperatures and the frequency of extreme warm temperature events are both predicted to increase by 2100 (IPCC 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), with two important implications for wildlife: (i) populations or individuals that fail to track their thermal niche could suffer a reduction in fitness, leaving them more vulnerable to other stressors and (ii) the increasing regularity of extreme events will give populations less time to recover from shocks (Oliver, Brereton &amp; Roy 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The principal means of offsetting warming involve manipulation of vegetation and/or topography. Differences in vegetation type and height are well‐established modifiers of the thermal environment. Local temperatures in areas with less vegetation cover are generally cooler during the night and warmer during the day (Suggitt 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and several studies, particularly on thermophilous insects, demonstrate the importance of these variations in microclimate in determining distribution and abundance (Thomas 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). For example, for the Glanville fritillary butterfly, the availability of suitable microclimates (as determined by the successional stage of vegetation) is almost twice as strong a predictor of butterfly abundance as regional air temperature (Curtis &amp; Isaac 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), probably because species can change habitat association in response to ambient temperatures (Suggitt 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Given that species may shift into relatively cooler habitats in response to warmer temperatures, it would appear axiomatic for land managers to implement management that results in more vegetation cover. However, given that loss of early‐successional habitat has been linked to species declines (e.g. Thomas 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) and that such habitats can be cooler at night, the creation (and maintenance) of thermally diverse habitats remains the current priority in insect conservation (Thomas, Simcox &amp; Hovestadt 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Although there is less evidence for taxa other than butterflies, it has been suggested that the thermal properties of microhabitats influence the distribution of a variety of other taxa (e.g. Kearney
