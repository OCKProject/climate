<p class="p">Given the effort and likely expense associated with altering topography or manipulating vegetation, the current advice to land managers remains that the creation of thermally diverse areas can be beneficial in that it can promote population stability, ameliorate the higher and more variable temperatures associated with climate change and is likely to provide habitat for a wider variety of species (Macgregor &amp; van Dijk

However, many sites are managed specifically for single species or related species reliant on specific habitat or topographic requirements. In these instances, the creation of more heterogeneous environments would be undesirable if at the expense of reducing the amount of optimal habitat. For example, within the UK, maximizing the availability of warm microclimates could benefit one‐sixth of rarer British butterfly species (Thomas 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), but this creation of warm microclimates may be detrimental to the remainder. The trade‐off between maintaining species diversity and increasing (general) abundance remains complex and reinforces that research at greater spatial and ecological detail remains a priority to understand the impact of climate change (Kearney &amp; Porter
