<p class="p">Topography, particularly the aspect and angle of slopes, controls the amount of radiation received near the Earth's surface and hence exerts strong influences on the temperatures experienced by many organisms, particularly in mid‐latitudes to high latitudes (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). As with vegetation structure, there is much evidence that local variation topography interacts with regional climate to have major influences on species distribution and abundance. For example, many species are restricted to warmer, equatorward slopes at their poleward (cold) range margin (Pigott

 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). For example, work to restore quarries after mineral extraction (Nature After Minerals 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), and more specifically the creation of artificial scrapes (e.g. Slater 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) have been shown to benefit both butterflies and plants. Furthermore, many housing and infrastructure development projects entail the artificial profiling of construction sites, which in some cases has led to successful colonizations of sites previously unimportant for wildlife (e.g. Danahar 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Increasingly, developers are required to mitigate or offset the ecological impacts of construction through the creation or restoration of habitats for wildlife (Defra
