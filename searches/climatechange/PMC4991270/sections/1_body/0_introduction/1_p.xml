<p class="p">Over the next 100 years, climate change is likely to become one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss world‐wide (Maclean &amp; Wilson 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Conservation policymakers and practitioners thus face the challenge of enhancing the adaptive capacity of biodiversity to climate change (Heller &amp; Zavaleta 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, ecosystems have been modified extensively and it is likely that a substantial proportion of species will be hindered from tracking climate change by their inability to traverse large distances over hostile land cover (Mantyka‐Pringle, Martin &amp; Rhodes 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Although numerous species have redistributed towards higher latitudes and elevations (Chen 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), for many the shift has not been fast enough to keep pace with climate change (Menéndez 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). While much discussion of adaptation to climate change has focussed on accommodating or assisting these range shifts, less attention has been given to the alternative strategy of improving species' ability to cope with climate change within their existing range. One means the conservation world has of achieving this is by manipulating habitat conditions to better match species requirements. However, to date, there has been little guidance from scientists about how this can be achieved.
