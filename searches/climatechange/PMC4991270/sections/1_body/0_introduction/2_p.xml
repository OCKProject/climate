<p class="p">Many species, particularly in Europe and North America, are reliant on habitat manipulation (e.g. Luoto, Pykälä &amp; Kuussaari 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). It has also been demonstrated that some species can alter their use of habitat in response to variation in climate, for example utilizing cooler habitats more frequently when temperatures are warmer (Suggitt

 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Taken together, these lines of evidence suggest that habitats can be manipulated to buffer species against the adverse effects of climate change. The evidence that such an approach may be effective, while indirect in many cases, is growing. Here we review this evidence. Temperature is not the only component of the climate that is changing, however. Changes in precipitation and, by extension, water availability may have even greater impacts on ecosystems than temperature and indirect impacts such as from sea‐level rise will also be important (IPCC 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Our review thus focuses on terrestrial impacts and on three of the major environmental changes associated with climatic change: temperature, water availability and sea‐level rise.
