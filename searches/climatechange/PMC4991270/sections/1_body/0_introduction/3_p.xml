<p class="p">A wide spectrum of site‐based approaches has been proposed to adapt conservation to climate change. However, many are generic, available to conservation managers irrespective of climate change. It is impractical to attempt to cover all techniques for site‐based conservation in a single review, so our review of these wider techniques is limited to a brief synthesis. Our primary focus is on how 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> management could be used to manipulate the climatic conditions experienced by organisms. As our aim is to provide guidance for site managers, we also highlight a few instances where localized landscape management, such as catchment hydrology manipulation, could enhance the 
 <italic class="italic">in situ</italic> persistence of target species.
