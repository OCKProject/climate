<p class="p">To identify potential management techniques, we searched Web of Science using terms related to climate change and management (see Appendix S1 in Supporting Information for list), identifying 101 studies as potentially relevant. Each of these was studied and the reference list queried to identify further relevant studies. Any additional studies known to the authors were also included. Our review is based on information in 67 relevant papers identified in this way. Full details of the search methods are provided in Appendix S1.</p>
