<p class="p">The strength of evidence for each management technique was assigned a quantitative score using three criteria: (i) the magnitude of the responses reported by each study; (ii) the overall confidence in the documented responses and (iii) the number of studies reporting that management technique. The risk of failure associated with each management technique, both in terms of the risk that the technique is ineffective and in terms of undesirable side effects, was assigned a quantitative score using: (i) the likelihood of an adverse response (assessed using the confidence in reported responses) and (ii) evidence in the wider literature not pertaining to climate change that such management can have undesirable effects. Economic feasibility was not considered. Formal definitions and the methods by which scores were combined are provided in Appendix S1. A full list of potential management techniques is provided in Table
