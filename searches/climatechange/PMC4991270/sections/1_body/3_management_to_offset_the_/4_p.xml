 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) showed that cattle grazing offsets the effects of increased winter precipitation on the hydroperiod of ephemeral wetlands by enhancing evapotranspiration, thus improving conditions for endangered invertebrates and amphibians. However, cattle grazing can also have the opposite effect. The depressions created by livestock trampling often accumulate water, and in some instances grazing is used as a means of ensuring conditions remain suitably wet (Maclean
