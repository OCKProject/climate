<p class="p">Globally, trends in precipitation are not clear‐cut (IPCC 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and environmental managers are likely to be faced with the challenge of adapting nature conservation to both wetter and drier conditions, sometimes in the same location at different times of year. Notwithstanding this challenge, there is a substantial precedent in managing landscapes to regulate water supply (Table
