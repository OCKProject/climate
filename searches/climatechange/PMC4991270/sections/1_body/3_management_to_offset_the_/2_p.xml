<p class="p">Broadly, three management approaches have been used to influence water availability (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), although many examples are not specifically associated with adapting nature conservation to climate change. The first entails modifying land use to divert or regulate water supply downstream. In grazing marshes in the East of England for example, artificial shallow drains have been used to divert water to the middle of marshes. This process creates areas of flooding and damp habitat that can potentially provide a mosaic of nesting habitat and profitable feeding areas for breeding waders (Eglington

The small spatial scale at which most amphibians operate makes them ideally suited to habitat manipulations of this type and there is consequently considerable potential to offset some of the adverse effects of climate change on amphibians through active management (Table
