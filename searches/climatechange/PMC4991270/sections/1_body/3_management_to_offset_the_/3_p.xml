<p class="p">A second approach involves manipulating catchment hydrology to influence water availability upstream. For example, the soil moisture of peatlands in the United Kingdom has been manipulated by blocking ditches. This in turn increases cranefly Tipulidae abundance, particularly in dry years (Table

Craneflies are a key herbivore in these habitats and an important prey item for breeding birds, but they are susceptible to drought. The diversion of water (partly to benefit wildlife) can, on occasion, operate on a grand scale. In Florida, for example, there are plans to construct canals and levees to restore the everglades over an area of 47 000 km
