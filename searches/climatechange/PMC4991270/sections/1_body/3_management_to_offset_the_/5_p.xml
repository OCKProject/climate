<p class="p">This latter finding serves to illustrate one of the challenges faced by managers: namely what to do when. Arguably the most important consideration will be what changes are expected. Where reductions in water availability are forecasted, creating wetter conditions is likely to be beneficial and vice versa. Where greater variability is predicted, the creation of a stable water supply is likely to be desirable. A means of achieving greater stability is through the creation of permeable timber barriers, artificial diversion ponds and careful positioning of woody debris in streams, all techniques which have been used to attenuate run‐off during periods of high rainfall (Table

Where there is uncertainty surrounding the availability of water, techniques that enhance heterogeneity in water availability are likely to be the most effective as they will increase the likelihood that suitable conditions for target species exist. Management techniques for achieving this include the creation of shallow scrapes and pools using heavy construction plant machinery (Natural England 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) or encouraging low‐density livestock grazing and trampling in marshes, fens and wet meadows (Tesauro &amp; Ehrenfeld 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Bunding ditches (or diverting them to increase drainage in areas where susceptible to undesirable flooding) should also be considered as interventions in wet grassland, peatland and mire systems (Hopkins

 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). It should be noted, however, that grazing can also have adverse effects in some ecosystems, particularly drier systems, or fail to have desired benefits (Lunt, Jansen &amp; Binns 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and increasing heterogeneity may reduce the availability of optimal habitat. Any changes in grazing regimes or other management techniques implemented to increase heterogeneity should thus proceed with caution.
