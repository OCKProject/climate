<p class="p">In addition to manipulating environmental conditions, there are several more general methods that have been used to enhance the capacity for biodiversity to cope with climate change (see, e.g., Macgregor &amp; van Dijk 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). At the most generic level this may simply involve reducing other threats. The general contention is that, by reducing or preventing other threats to biota, target wildlife is better able to cope with climate change. Although it can be assumed that ameliorating the risk from these other threats will benefit a species' climate response, direct evidence of this occurring in practice has been more forthcoming for some threats than others. Interactions with pest species have been particularly well documented and there is a substantial amount of evidence that exposure to pest species makes affected species more vulnerable to drought‐induced water stress (Breshears 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), while also impeding the recovery of forests from extreme storm events (Pawson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The compounding effects of species invasions and climate change are also well documented, but most of the evidence for the utility of this approach is mixed and context‐dependent, primarily because the evidence for competition‐related declines is similarly conflicting. In the UK for example, ‘non‐native’ plants have limited negative impact on native diversity (Thomas &amp; Palmer 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), but in the Alps, high‐altitude plants are being out‐competed by low‐altitude plants (Gottfried 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and here the lack of an alternative habitat (upslope) strengthens the case for interventions to defend what climatically suitable habitat remains. The realities of conservation funding mean that attention in this area is focussed on those species with the highest economic impact, and thus, evidence we have for the efficacy of invasion control is similarly biased. However, there are cases where the increased prevalence of ‘non‐native’ species interacts with climatic conditions to compound the adverse effects. For example, vigorous, competitive invaders such as 
 <italic class="italic">Rhododendron ponticum</italic> are likely to reduce understorey microclimatic heterogeneity and floating Cyanobacteria can lead to the loss of cold‐water refugia as a result of hypolimnetic anoxia (Havens 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>).
