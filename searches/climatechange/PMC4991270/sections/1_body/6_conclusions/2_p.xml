<p class="p">While empirical evidence for the effects on biota of these management actions is in its early stages, it is clear from the evidence already available that, in some circumstances, there is a compelling case for management. Nonetheless, some techniques have a higher risk of failure or unexpected outcomes than others. We have assessed the strength of evidence of a selection of the approaches (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) in order to provide an indicative idea to conservation professionals of the likely effectiveness of a given approach. We also assess the risk of failure, as some techniques may have undesirable effects and provide a list of those techniques that are unlikely to work (Table 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). There will also be inherent trade‐offs: for example, prioritizing heterogeneity will come at the expense of some ‘optimal’ habitat for species. Allowing taller vegetation to establish will reduce light availability and provide a higher degree of competition (WallisDeVries &amp; Van Swaay 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). The degree to which one strategy or another is preferable will also depend on the time period over which it is enacted, with techniques to protect existing biota at a site more attractive in the short term, but accommodation or even encouragement of change likely to be required in the long term (Rannow
