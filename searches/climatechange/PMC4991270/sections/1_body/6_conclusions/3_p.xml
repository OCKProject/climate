<p class="p">Overall, however, replicated and monitored local manipulations of habitat that ascertain the efficacy of management actions are rather scarce. Perhaps one of the reasons why such case studies are lacking is the weak implementation of adaptive management (e.g. Mitchell 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In a technical sense, this entails manipulating a system in order to improve understanding and hence manage it more effectively. It is intended to be a structured, iterative process that leads to robust decisions in the face of uncertainty. In reality, however, it is often taken to mean that managers retain flexibility and respond as situations develop (e.g. Mitchell 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and some argue that the phrase ‘adaptive management’ is usually used to disguise weak conservation practices (e.g. Sutherland 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Furthermore, even if applied correctly, the approach relies on there being measurable ecological responses to management that can be distinguished from other factors (Oliver &amp; Morecroft 
 <xref rid="jpe12602-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Consequently, irrespective of whether management is being carried out adaptively or proactively, there is much need for well‐documented examples of habitat manipulations carried out in ways that permit their effectiveness to be established. It is thus important to document failure as well as success. It is likely that future efforts to safeguard biodiversity against the effects of climate change will require a rich variety of approaches. It is our belief that the deliberate manipulation of environmental conditions through habitat management should be considered as part of the suite of options available and the effectiveness of such actions adequately tested and documented.
