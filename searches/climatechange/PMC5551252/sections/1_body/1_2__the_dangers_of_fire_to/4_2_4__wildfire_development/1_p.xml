<p class="p">Wildfires are also governed by the principal Equations (1)âˆ’(3). Rather than thermal radiation, it has recently been documented that convective flame heat transfer is the most important near-field fire spread mechanism [
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Wind is a central factor assisting this heat transfer. As the fire grows, the fire spread may also be assisted by, and governed by airborne transport of glowing embers and firebrands over very long distances, i.e., kilometers [
 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. The drier the wildland fuel, the easier it ignites and the more intensely it burns. When dried beyond a certain level prior to a fire, the soil may also be involved in the combustion process. Drying of wildland fuel may be quite fast, also in subzero temperatures and when dead, the fuel usually dries quickly as no live bark layer limits the drying processes [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Dieback of potential wildland fuel may be caused by subzero temperature drying (desiccation), such as experienced in the Calluna stands in Norway succeeding the snow-free and cold January and February 2014 [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The drying of wildland fuel (and the soil) is therefore of vital importance for wildland fire risk.
