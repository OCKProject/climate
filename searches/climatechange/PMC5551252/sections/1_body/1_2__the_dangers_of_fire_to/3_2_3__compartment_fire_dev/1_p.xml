 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. When the smoke layer temperature approaches 550−600 °C, the heat flux levels are so high that the fire likely passes through a stage of sudden increase in severity called flashover. Post flashover, the hot smoke and flame layer temperatures are typically around 1000 °C and all combustible surfaces are involved in the fire. The mass flow of fuel then usually exceeds the amount being combusted by the air flow into the compartment. The excess fuel burns as flames out of the ventilation openings giving potential spread of the fire to the facades and to neighbor structures. The drier the combustibles are, the faster the fire spreads [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] and the earlier a flashover may be expected [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) is therefore of vital importance for fire development and conflagration risk.
