<p class="p">The health impacts of cold climate fires are significant, as demonstrated by the four subzero temperatures fires discussed in the present work: a wooden village fire, a single wood structure fire, a wildland urban interface (WUI) fire and a huge wildland fire. These four fires resulted in 32 fatalities, 385 persons hospitalized for shorter or longer periods, 104 structures lost and 1015 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> wildland burned north of, and just south of, the Arctic Circle. Medical effects of smoke and heat exposure and psychological effects related to loss of relatives and loss of possessions are severe. It is shown that a combination of environmental factors such as subzero temperature dry weather, strong winds, declining snowpack alone, or in combination with changing agricultural activities, may involve threats to people not previously anticipated. Such multi-discipline factor combinations may not be easily identified as risk contributors. The effects of indoor dryness and risk implications regarding fire development involving dry wood are discussed. Methods for risk identification and general training in understanding contributing risk factors are suggested for reducing the impacts of a possibly increasing number of such fires in the near future.
