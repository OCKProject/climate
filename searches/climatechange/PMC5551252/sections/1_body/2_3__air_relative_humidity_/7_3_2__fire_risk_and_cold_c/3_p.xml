<p class="p">One may argue that there have always been very dry periods during winters in Arctic areas. In Norway, the locals benefitted from this dry weather by drying stockfish for the international market, etc. However, global warming results in the wildland being exposed to warmer weather, i.e., faster drying, and more exposure to drying due to declining snow pack. When exposed to adiabatically heated (dry) subzero temperature air, without the protective snow layer, winter time wildfires may become an increasing challenge [
