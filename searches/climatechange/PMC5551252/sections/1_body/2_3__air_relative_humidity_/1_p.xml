<p class="p">The vapor pressure of water is a function of temperature. The water saturation concentration in air at atmospheric pressure can be calculated based on the work by Tetens [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. The air usually contains less water than this, and the relative fraction is called the air Relative Humidity (RH). The saturation concentration increases with temperature, i.e., more water can be in the vapor phase. Additionally, when heating cold air to indoor temperatures, it is depleted some in humidity concentrations due to the expansion of gases with temperature. When heated, the air therefore becomes dry, i.e., low Relative Humidity (RH). As an example, outdoor air at −5 °C and 80% RH brought indoor and heated to 22 °C theoretically results in 13% RH indoors, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Moisture supply from activities like dishwashing, people and pets breathing, pot plants etc. do increase the indoor RH slightly, but in cold climates the indoor air still usually becomes very dry due to the normal air exchange rate. This is confirmed in several studies in Nordic countries, e.g., by Kalamees et al. [
