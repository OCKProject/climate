<p class="p">Wood and other cellulosic products are hygroscopic (hydrogen bonds). Live plants may contain substantial amounts of water, i.e., &gt;100% relative to being oven dried 48 h at 105 Â°C [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Dead wood, when not soaked contains less than 30 wt % (weight %) water to the dry weight basis. The Equilibrium Moisture Content (EMC) is a function of the air Relative Humidity (RH) shown in

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>], but in principle, wood drier or wetter than the actual EMC, will approach the EMC value by absorbing or releasing humidity (drying).
