<p class="p">The first cold climate fire that caught the authors’ attention was the Opémiska Community Hall fire that occurred at 01:30, 1 January 1980, in Chapais (Quebec, Canada), which got international media coverage. Tragedy struck when a fire took hold in tinder-dry decorative spruce or fir boughs in the Community Hall, where about 350 persons had gathered for the New Year celebrations [

This was the worst fire to occur in Quebec for more than 40 years. The next cold climate fire that caught attention was the 1994 New Year eve fire at the Switel Hotel in Antwerp, Belgium [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Four hundred and fifty people were seated in the banqueting room adjacent to a smaller entrance room, where two Christmas trees caught fire. Due to the lower ceiling height, the fire almost instantly resulted in a flashover. The short (apparently less than 1 min duration), but very severe fire resulted in significant personal and material losses, i.e., 12 people died within a couple of days and more than 140 people were injured. CFD modelling was used to explain the surprising severity of the fire and the health impacts on the people exposed [

Grouping these two extreme fires in the boxes “decoration fires” or “Christmas tree fires” may result in the fundamental causes of these fires being overlooked. The previously mentioned indoor low Relative Humidity (RH) and thereby strong drying potential is together with the thin fuel dimensions, the main reasons for fir and pine decorations, wreaths and Christmas trees representing severe fire risks in winter time.
