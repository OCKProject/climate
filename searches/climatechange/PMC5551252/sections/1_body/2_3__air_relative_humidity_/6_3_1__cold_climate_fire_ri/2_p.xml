<p class="p">A recent study of fires in Australia showed that there was a higher Odds Ratio (OR) for dying in a home fire during the winter time than during the warmer seasons [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. During cold months, and given a fire, the OR for death in a fire was 1.9 times higher than survival. In their work, this was not further explained, but it certainly is an indication of more severe fire development in colder weather, in line with the previously described drying potential. It also confirms the experiences from the 1980 Op√©miska Community Hall fire in Chapais, Quebec [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>,
