 <xref rid="B33-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] showed that the frequency of urban building fires was correlated with dew point temperature in the winter for selected areas studied in the USA, i.e., lower ambient dew point resulted in higher fire frequency. In countries with cold climates building fires are still more common during winter [
