<p class="p">It can be shown mathematically, or by experiments, that a 10 mm thick wood panel suddenly exposed to, and kept exposed to, dry air on one side reaches close to the new EMC conditions within 4–5 days at 22 °C [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Unless wetted to beyond the fiber saturation point, upholstery and fabrics dry significantly faster to the new EMC condition, i.e., usually within an hour or two. Exposed to similar relative humidity air at slightly subzero temperatures outdoors, wood dries at about 1/5 of the drying rate at indoor conditions, but it still dries. Shrubs with much dead biomass, twigs and thin branches, such as old heather (
