<p class="p">One may question whether the four fires discussed are a result of climate changes. With respect to the Résidence du Havre nursing home (senior home) fire, it has “always” been cold in Quebec in January. The same holds for Lærdalsøyri, Norway. However, the combination of strong winds and low temperatures/dry weather is quite unusual, at least in Lærdal. In Flatanger, the combination of no snow, subzero temperatures and strong desiccating winds is highly unusual, and declining snowpack is a certain sign of climate changes [

The authors believe, but cannot prove, that climate changes played a role in all these fires. As the frequency of cold spells is predicted to increase in northern regions due to climate change [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>], health issues due to cold climate fires risk can be expected to increase. It is therefore important to be aware of this development and carefully identify the increased risk of extreme fire events. Otherwise, this can become a growing public health issue.
