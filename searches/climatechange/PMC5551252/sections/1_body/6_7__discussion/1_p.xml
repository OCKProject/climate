<p class="p">The general dangers of the fires to humans, i.e., civilians and firefighters, as well as the impact of megafires on the environment have been briefly presented. Four subzero temperature fires have been analyzed in more detail. These fires span the range from fires in low density wooden town area (Lærdal, Norway), a devastating nursing home fire (L’Isle Verte, Canada), a Wildland Urban Interface fire (Flatanger, Norway) and a wildland megafire (North Face, Alaska). It is demonstrated that the drying of wooden products had a central role in all these fires. The health impacts range from indirect issues such as loss of homes and jobs and mass evacuation to hospitalization and 32 lives lost in a single fire. A span in fires like this has both limitations and strengths. More knowledge could have been revealed by studying each type of fire in more detail. However, studying this range of fires may make it easier to recognize that the drying of wood and other cellulosic materials entails a fire threat that appears to have slipped below the radar. It is especially challenging to the most vulnerable people. In combination with strong winds, dry cellulosic combustibles may result in conflagrations due to the fast and long distance fire spread, both in towns as well as in the wildlands and wildland urban interface.</p>
