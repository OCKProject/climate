<p class="p">Mitigating structural cold climate fire risk peaks may include campaigns for reducing the number of fires, relocation of firefighting resources for sufficiently early water on fire, firebrand intrusion barriers limiting spread into new structures, etc. Mitigating measures for WUI fires may include prescribed and controlled burning of fire buffer areas in the terrain close to people at risk. Mitigating the effects of Arctic mega fires is probably best achieved by reducing global warming, to which these fires may contribute. As the drying can be predicted based on weather forecasts, periods of increased risk may be monitored and even forecasted. This is a very important first step in future fire prevention and mitigation of the potential health impacts of the possibly increasing number of cold climate fires.</p>
