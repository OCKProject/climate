<p class="p">Training firefighting skills and incident command co-ordination may be done using physical or virtual simulators as a cost-effective and safe alternative to practice with real scale fires. The recent development in video games and new consumer-level physical video interfaces is promising. Simulations and Serious Games (SSG), games whose primary purpose is education and training, may soon become a proper training tool [
 <xref rid="B60-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. As an example, practicing a few scenarios with normal case fire development, including the mentioned time delays needed to validate the alarms, mobilize, drive to the fire scene, organize fire hoses and start fighting the fire, may make the participants familiar with normal case fire development. The next scenario could then be a winter month (very dry indoor conditions) fire which develops twice as fast. The pure shock of (always?) arriving too late to control the fire will probably make the students think quite seriously about why this happened. Using real cases is suggested also by Heldal et al. [
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>] to make the most out of SSG practices. Learning from contingency exercises and severe incidents in other sectors may also be worthwhile [
