<p class="p">Weighing the same wood sample exposed to dry and humid conditions may convince the audience that the dry wood contains significantly less water than more humid wood. Simple consumer market humidifiers and dehumidifiers placed in small plastic tents may be used as low cost wood conditioners. Then, demonstrating a Â¼ scale normal case FMC value wooden compartment fire and a similar dry wood fire will clearly show faster dry wood fire development [
