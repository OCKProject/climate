<p class="p">As there seems to be a lack of understanding/acknowledgement of the increased risk regarding cold climate fires, the knowledge of the underlying dry wood fire dynamics must be improved to prevent these fires, or to extinguish them early [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In a risk perspective, reducing the number of fires must be priority number one in order to reduce the health impacts. The second priority must be to extinguish the fire, i.e., get water on the fire before it becomes too severe. This could be achieved by automatic sprinklers, water mist systems, etc. or by early interference by capable persons using a fire hose. Further research on how to improve the mental risk picture is encouraged.
