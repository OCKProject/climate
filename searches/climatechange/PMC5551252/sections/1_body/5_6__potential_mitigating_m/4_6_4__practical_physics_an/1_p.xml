<p class="p">Similar practical demonstrations may also be done using small scale models illustrating wildfire risk. Conditioned mockups of humid and dry 3–4 mm diameter wood cylinders representing a wildfire fuel of different FMC values may simulate the characteristics of wildfire fuels. Igniting a 2 m tall dry juniper (
 <italic class="italic">Juniperus communis</italic> L.), an abundant resinous “weed” in successional North Atlantic coastal heathlands, would serve the spectators with an unforgettable “don’t do this at home” fire. Further research on practical physics regarding drying and wildland fuel combustion is encouraged.
