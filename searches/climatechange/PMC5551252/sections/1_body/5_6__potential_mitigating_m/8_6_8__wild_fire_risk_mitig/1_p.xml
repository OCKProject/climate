<p class="p">Other preventive measures may work better for mitigating cold climate dry weather wildfire risk. As an example, at Flatanger, regular controlled burning would reduce the fire risk in dedicated buffer zones and also be beneficial for the heather [

 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Planned burning may be difficult in large areas. It can, however, be very beneficial in strategic locations, e.g., between lakes and other natural fire breaks, especially in close proximity to hamlets at risk. This will also keep the growth of the highly flammable resinous foliage juniper (

 <xref rid="B70-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>], under control in the buffer zones. Recognizing an increasing risk by keeping an eye on the weather development and especially the predicted RH values will help prepare firefighters for any increased WUI risk. Proper early action may reduce the consequences significantly. This also holds for potential megafires in Arctic areas. The huge distances and limited access roads do, however, make it extremely difficult to fight such remote fires. On the other hand, if detected early (by e.g., remote satellite IR cameras), there might be a chance of controlling these fires. Further research on using prescribed burning to develop efficient fire barriers is encouraged.
