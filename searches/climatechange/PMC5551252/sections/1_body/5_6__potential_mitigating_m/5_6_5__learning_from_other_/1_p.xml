<p class="p">Some climate changes are easily observable, such as cold spells, declining snowpack, strong wind forecasts, etc. The problem may be to recognize the local impacts and significant risk peaks. Maybe a modified HAZID (hazard identification) study adopted from the industry, with proper check lists, can be a step forward in identifying changing fire risks. Then, some sort of hazard and operability (HAZOP) analysis, where each identified “node” is analyzed for changes like more, less, lower, higher, etc. could be useful for understanding the variability in the identified risks. The As Low As is Reasonable Practicable (ALARP) principle, originating from the UK mining industry, and adopted as a regulatory requirement by the health and safety authorities in many countries for the oil &amp; gas industry [
 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>], may also be a guidance. In the ALARP spirit one has to demonstrate that each possible Risk Reducing Measure (RRM) identified must be grossly disproportionate in cost or effort compared to the associated risk reduction achieved in order not to be implemented. Such approaches may help preventing the pitfall of “the yearly average risk is OK’-thinking. Further research on applying industrial hazard and risk analysis methods on civil sector fire risk is encouraged.
