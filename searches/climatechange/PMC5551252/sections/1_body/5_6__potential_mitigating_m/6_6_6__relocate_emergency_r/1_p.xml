<p class="p">Relocation of firefighters and fire trucks has been suggested for Santiago, Chile, to better handle the temporal and spatial variation in fire risk, i.e., WUI fires in the outskirts of the city in the summer (October to March) and wooden structure fires in the old city center in the winter, i.e., April to September [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Relocation of firefighters closer to high risk areas during identified risk peaks may reduce the health impacts of such fires. Further developing such ideas is encouraged.
