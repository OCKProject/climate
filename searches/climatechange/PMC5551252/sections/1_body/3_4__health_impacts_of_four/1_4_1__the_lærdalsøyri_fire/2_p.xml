<p class="p">About 680 persons were evacuated and fortunately, this conflagration did not result in any fatalities. Some inhabitants did, however, refuse evacuation orders, hid from the police forces and continued firefighting with garden hoses, cans and buckets, exposing themselves to the dangers of the fire. Four hundred and forty six persons were checked in at the local hospital and 270 were hospitalized for shorter or longer periods, most of them due to smoke exposure and burns from embers and firebrands [
