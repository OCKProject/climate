<p class="p">In contrast to the windy and very wet December 2013, during January 2014 the weather in large parts of South-Western Norway was cold (subzero), dry and windy. Air from the central Norwegian mountain regions was compressed as a result of higher pressure at sea level and thereby adiabatically heated when descending towards sea level in the easterly gradient winds. This resulted in slightly subzero temperatures and low relative humidity (RH) drying the outdoor wooden materials [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Heating this air to indoor conditions at e.g., 22 °C resulted in very low indoor Relative Humidity (RH). 18 January, when a fire started in a private home, external and especially internal wooden materials were very susceptible to ignition and severe burning. The fire developed extremely fast in the home of the fire origin, spread to neighboring homes and threatened the whole village, including the Old Lærdalsøyri cultural heritage site. Destroying 40 structures, including 15 private homes and four historic buildings [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], it was the largest peacetime fire in Norway since 1923 when 250 structures were lost at Hemnesberget [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The fire area was about 500 m × 200 m. Spotting ignition by firebrands was identified as the most important fire spread mechanism [
 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. This fire came as a surprise to the local firefighters, as well as the national fire authorities, i.e., a typical Black Swan event [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. This risk was known to some [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and may therefore be characterized as an “unknown known” Black Swan event [
