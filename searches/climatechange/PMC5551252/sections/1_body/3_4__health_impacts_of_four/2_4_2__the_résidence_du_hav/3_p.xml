The relative humidity (RH) was around 80–90%. Heating air at −15 °C and 90% RH to 22 °C theoretically results in 6.5% RH indoors, i.e., well below the theoretically calculated 11% RH prior to the Lærdalsøyri fire five days earlier [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Indoor activities increase the relative humidity some. The interior potential combustible cellulose based fuel must, however, have been very dry and susceptible to intense combustion prior to ignition.
