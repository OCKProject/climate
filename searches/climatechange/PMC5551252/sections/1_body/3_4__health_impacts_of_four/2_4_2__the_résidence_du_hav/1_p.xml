Phase I, a unit for residential use, was built in 1997 before sprinkler requirements were enforced while Phase II, a supervised residence, was built in 2003, under rules requiring an automatic sprinkler system. In the case of fire, the emergency procedure was to direct the inhabitants of Phase I to a safe area, i.e., to the Phase II.
