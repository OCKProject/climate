<p class="p">In Norway the cold dry weather continued throughout January 2014. There was no snow cover in the coastal scarcely inhabited lowlands in Nord Tr√∏ndelag. The dry and windy weather desiccated (freeze dried) vegetation and soil. In large areas along the coast, such as Flatanger, regular maintenance of heather by frequent controlled mosaic burning had previously been performed for optimizing herbivore production, i.e., mainly sheep grazing. After World War II, this landscape use was gradually abandoned. This allowed the area to build up significant amounts of elevated biomass, especially in the form of heather (
 <italic class="italic">Calluna vulgaris</italic> L.) with much dead elevated lower canopy and litter, i.e., biomass very susceptible to drying and potential subsequent combustion.
