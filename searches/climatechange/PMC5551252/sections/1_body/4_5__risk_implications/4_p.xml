<p class="p">When studying the relationships between fire service response time and fire outcomes in New Zealand, Challands [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] discovered that the fraction of fires considered large, i.e., over 30 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, was linearly related to the response time x (minutes). The linear relationship for 27,500 structural fires gave y = 0.023 min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>·x + 0.043, i.e., 2.3% more fires had grown beyond 30 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for each additional minute response time. For very dry wood fires, the relationship may be similar, but probably with a steeper slope as the fires reach flashover earlier.
