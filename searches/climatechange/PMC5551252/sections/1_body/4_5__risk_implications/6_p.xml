<p class="p">One may question whether risk peaks related to cold climate fires are sufficiently understood. An example of the average risk and an imagined actual risk is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. In the sketch, it is indicated that the risk was below the average during the first 5 days. Then, the weather became cold and dry for the rest of the period shown on the figure. At day 9, the wood is quite dry, i.e., some higher risk, as indicated also in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. Then, from day 10 there is a weather forecast predicting very strong winds for about one week. From day 10 to day 17 very high risk peaks can be expected making the average risk irrelevant in this period. The fire brigade units are, however, dimensioned in accordance to this average risk (with perhaps 30% safety margin?). People are confident that the fire fighters will manage to handle the fire. Then, when a fire disaster strikes at e.g., day 14 everybody seems surprised. The authors fear that severe risk peaks may be overlooked based on the yearly risk average. However, at day 9 in the example 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>, if the windy daysâ€™ risk is drawn and visualized, a better understanding of the future risk may be obtained.
