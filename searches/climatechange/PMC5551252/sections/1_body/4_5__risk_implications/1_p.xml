<p class="p">Both the official investigations after the Lærdalsøyri, L’Isle-Verte, and Flatanger fires focused on training of volunteer and part time firefighters and on regrouping and unifying fire departments to make stronger units, especially in rural and distant areas [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Trained firefighters from larger fire stations would probably do an even better job. Would this, however, make a difference if they regardless arrive too late in the case of very fast developing fire? This question must be seen in relation to the analysis by Holte et al. [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>] who concluded that the emergency responders in the Lærdalsøyri fire and the Flatanger fire did indeed act within the prevailing rules and regulations. In the mentioned investigation reports there are no references to indoor drying of wooden materials. If asking individual officers and decision makers, they would probably agree that very dry wood burns more intensely than more humid wood. They may perhaps also know that it generally becomes very dry indoors during cold winter weather. Combining these two facts and relate them to the fire risk may, however, not be trivial. These fire risk impacts are therefore briefly outlined.
