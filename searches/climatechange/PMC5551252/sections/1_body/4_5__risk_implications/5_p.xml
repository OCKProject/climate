<p class="p">To understand the difference between e.g., 10 min and 6 min to flashover (and a fully engulfing home fire) for the emergency response system, we may investigate a time line for the fire fighters actions. We then simply compare 10 min available for the firefighters in the normal condition to 6 min for cold climate dry wood condition. For simplicity, we may assume that the fires are discovered instantly by a fire alarm sounding to warn the inhabitants. According to Averill et al. [
 <xref rid="B58-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>] it takes about 60 s to verify a fire alarm, evaluate the situation and eventually inform the 911 central. A 60 s processing time at the 911 alarm central and a turnout time of 80 s can be expected for manned fire stations [
 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. When at site, 40 s may be added to get oriented, roll out fire hoses and start fighting the fire, i.e., Water on Fire (WOF). This adds up to 4 min. For simplicity, we further assume that fire vehicles drive at 60 km/h and that all roads go radially out from the fire station, no traffic jams, etc. In the normal case this leaves 10 − 4 = 6 min for driving before it is too late to control the fire, i.e., the range is 6 km. In the dry wood case, they may drive for 6 − 4 = 2 min, i.e., range 2 km. The area coverages (π·r
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) turns out to be 113.1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 12.6 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, respectively, i.e., the area coverage in the dry condition is only 1/9th of the area coverage in the normal case. Part-time on-call firefighters will need additional time to get to the fire station, making this risk picture even worse. This was indeed the case in the Lærdalsøyri [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] fire, the L’Isle-Verte [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] fire and the Flatanger fire [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. During winter time in cold climate areas, snow and icy roads may also add to the time needed for the firefighters to get WOF.
