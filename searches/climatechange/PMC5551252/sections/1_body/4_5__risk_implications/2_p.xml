<p class="p">The time needed for a 2.5 kW fire to develop to flashover in 1/4 scale wooden pine test rooms of varying Fuel Moisture Content (FMC) was recently studied by Kraaijeveld et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. The time to flashover was reduced from 8 min for wood at 9.3 wt % FMC to only 4 minutes at 4.5 wt % FMC. At room temperature, this respectively corresponds to about 50% RH and 20% RH [

Faster development of a fire in a detached home, with (in Norway) mandatory smoke alarm systems installed, may not represent a significantly increased risk to mobile inhabitants. They will most likely still have sufficient time margins for evacuation, as indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-14-00814-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. This is in line with the general belief that the occupants need to self-evacuate long before the fire service arrives [

For people with impaired mobility it may, however, be the difference between being safely rescued or exposure to the direct dangers of the fire. In a large construction, where evacuation takes more time, or where the inhabitants experience impaired mobility, early flashover due to dry indoor conditions may result in catastrophic consequences, such as the RÃ©sidence du Havre nursing home fire [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. The cold climate fire risk is therefore in particular a threat to vulnerable groups. This is also emphasized by other researchers studying health impacts of fires [
