<p class="p">It is well known that fires represent a threat to people. In previous centuries it was considered the most severe threat to wooden villages and towns during peace time and most towns experienced at least one devastating conflagration (major fire) during their history. Some towns were regularly haunted by huge fires, often caused by hot work. As a risk-reducing measure, hot work could be banned and moved out of the town. A well-known example is the city of Venice, Italy, where the glassblowing industry was forced to move to the island of Murano in the XIIIth century to limit the fire risk.</p>
