<p class="p">During the last few years several unusual and severe cold climate fires have occurred. Four of these recent subzero temperature fires will be analyzed with respect to human health impacts. These are: a 1000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> wildfire in the Alaskan tundra North Slope, north of the Arctic Circle [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], a Wildland Urbane Interface (WUI) heather fire in Norway, just south of the Arctic Circle [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], a village fire in Norway [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] and a nursing home fire in Quebec, Canada [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00814" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Before analyzing these fires, the general dangers of fires to humans, i.e., civilians and firefighters, as well as the impact of megafires on the environment are explained. In view of the analysis of each separate fire, and external parameters influencing the fire risk, some general conclusions regarding the possible ways forward are drawn.
