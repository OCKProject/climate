<p id="p0055" class="p">The building of community-based adaptation in Indigenous contexts therefore is a challenging enterprise and adds yet another layer to the already often huge set of challenges Indigenous people face. Investigating how they can be supported, and what cultural difference may affect their development and implementation, can yield important insights that can help refine current and contribute to the success of future programs. Given this context, we now specifically report the results of a five-year research project that resulted in a community-based adaptation program developed by the Arabana people, traditional owners of the Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre region of central Australia, which is in the state of South Australia (2010â€“2015). The aim of the project was first to assess the vulnerability of the Arabana to climate change, and second, to build a community-based climate change adaptation strategy responding to the findings of the assessment. We report on the results of the latter. In so doing we sought to understand what conditions are needed to support Indigenous driven adaptation initiatives, if there are any cultural differences that need accounting for and how, once developed they be re-integrated into existing governance arrangements. While our results are based on our work with the Arabana people, we suggest they offer useful reflections relevant to other Indigenous peoples and climate change adaptation planning projects.</p>
