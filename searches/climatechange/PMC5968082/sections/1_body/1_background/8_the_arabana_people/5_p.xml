<p id="p0075" class="p">Finniss Springs Station, one of the pastoral ventures, emerged as particularly significant for Arabana people and has become an important part of their history. This is because its owner, Francis Warren, married an Arabana woman. In the 1930s, he invited the United Aborigines Mission to set up a school and church on Finniss Springs and a settlement was established. This history is important because the legacy of colonisation remains very real to many Arabana people, with some having grown-up in and around Finniss Springs and with many holding memories of dispersion, most notably caused by the railway that moved through their country. Consequently, the course of this history is influential in how Arabana people construct knowledge and respond to land management issues about their country, including climate change adaptation.</p>
