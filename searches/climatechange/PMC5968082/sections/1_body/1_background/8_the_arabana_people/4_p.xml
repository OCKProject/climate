<p id="p0070" class="p">The impact of colonisation was significant for the Arabana, and resulted in their dispersal from their country, with populations now living in Darwin, Alice Springs, Marree, Port Augusta and Adelaide (see Figs. 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> for details). As 
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fergie et al. (2013</xref>, 32) note: “The fault line of invasion undermined the grounds of their adaptive social system. Arabana people have had to adapt to the tectonic changes wrought by colonisation”. This included the incursion during the late 1850s by explorers, who arrived hoping to establish pastoral businesses on land they took from the Arabana and other groups in the region. In particular, the explorer John Stuart used mound springs (which carry significant cultural value to the Arabana), as “a conduit of colonial invasion and Arabana control and care of their country and their people had been usurped” (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fergie et al., 2013</xref>, 36). Following this appropriation of land for pastoralism, between 1870 and 1872, the overland Telegraph route was laid in 1884, also cutting through Arabana country. During 1889, a railway was then laid along the mound springs, also facilitating further colonial intrusion upon Arabana country (

  <p class="p">The recent influenza epidemic was disastrous, having in many centres, like Hergott Springs [Marree] and Oodnadatta, almost completely annihilated the resident groups. We were surprised also to note the appalling decrease in the numbers at Anna Creek, once a veritable stronghold of the local tribe when the station was in the hands of Messrs Hogarth and Warren. The principal camps at which we found the remnants of local groups congregated were at Finniss Springs, Stuart's Creek, Anna Creek, Oodnadatta, [and thence out of Arabana country].
