<p id="p0065" class="p">Originally named after the English explorer Edward John Eyre, the lake was renamed from Lake Eyre to Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre in 2012 to recognise the ongoing traditional Indigenous ownership by the Arabana people. The region is also the traditional land for the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjata (APY) Lands, and other Indigenous peoples who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Today, there are about 57,000 people living in the Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre basin working in pastoralism, tourism, mining and petroleum; as well as township-based work such as retail, education, medical and other services. The traditional country of the Arabana people is at the centre of this region and includes many sites of sacred spiritual significance to them.</p>
