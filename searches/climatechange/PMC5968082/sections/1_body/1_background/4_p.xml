 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barnett and Campbell, 2010</xref>). Indigenous farmers in Bolivia for example, associate their observations of climate change with other social and environmental changes, with climate change all part of a cycle (

 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">MacKinnon (2010)</xref> who says that community-based adaptation needs to be cognisant of wider scalar practice, a point particularly relevant in the multi-level and scalar governance regime that occurs in the Australian context. Environmental management can then occur as a social process that acknowledges heterogeneity and different socio-cultural contexts and supports adaptation at multiple scales and within multi-governance regimes (
