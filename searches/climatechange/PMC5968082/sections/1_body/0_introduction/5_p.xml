<p id="p0025" class="p">This paper reports on a such a project â€“ a detailed case study of Indigenous adaptation in Australia, (a collaborative partnership between the Arabana people from central Australia, and a team of Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers) which resulted in the production of Australia's first Indigenous adaptation strategy. For the Arabana, climate change adaptation is based on the centrality of country, it needs to be aligned with cultural values, and focus on the building of adaptive capacity. However, overall, we found that any discussion of adaptation cannot be divorced from the historical context of the Arabana experience and collective memory of colonisation. We argue that in developing culturally responsive climate governance for and with Indigenous peoples, that that the history of colonisation and the ongoing dominance of entrenched Western governance regimes is acknowledged and then redressed in contemporary environmental/climate change management.</p>
