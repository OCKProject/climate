<p id="p0085" class="p">The project received ethics approval from the Human Ethics Research Committee, at the University of Adelaide and it was formally endorsed (in minutes) and approved to proceed by the Arabana Board of Directors. We conducted two periods of fieldwork, in which time we interviewed over 120 Arabana people and a further 25 participated in a community-based adaptation workshop. Arabana people were interviewed from across all the places that they now live, not just those living near or on traditional country, and we worked with both men and women, youth and Elders. By doing so, we not only documented information about Arabana country but contemporary places of residence, over a period of 100 years.</p>
