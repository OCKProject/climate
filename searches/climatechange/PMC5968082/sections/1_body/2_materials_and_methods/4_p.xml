<p id="p0090" class="p">The process we used to collect information took place in four stages. In stage one, we commissioned a science impact report which identified what climate impacts had been observed and were predicted to be; not only for Arabana country but also for all the major population settlements where Arabana people now live. The second stage involved working together with Indigenous team members and the community to craft appropriate communications about these impacts, including a short film, flyers, and a web site. These communications were then used throughout the project to engage Arabana people in the project. The third stage involved two teams going out into the field. One team undertook a study into the adaptive capacity of the Arabana. The second team undertook a perception of risk and vulnerability study and documented Arabana suggestions for ideas of adaptation to those risks. A community adaptation workshop concluded the project and was attended by Arabana people from all over Australia. This meeting was used to present final project results, and then workshop and get agreement on the final Arabana adaptation strategy. This strategy was then endorsed formally by the Arabana Board of Directors (See
