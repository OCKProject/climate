<p id="p0175" class="p">However, this approach to implementation is 
 <italic class="italic">not</italic> consistent with Western (colonial) modes of decision making and hence achieving a cultural ‘fit’ between this initiative and the multiple other forms of environmental management arrangements in the State and nationally remains a challenge. In the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre region, multiple jurisdictional and policy arrangements exist at local institutional, government, state, and national levels. For example, at a national level, Australia has been divided up into 56 Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions, where resources have been devolved by the government to NRM Boards (composed of community representatives and paid staff), who in turn implement a range of environmental management activities. Yet as highlighted in 
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Curtis et al. (2014)</xref>, both in Australia and New Zealand, even models of devolved NRM governance are incompatible with adaptive management. There remain gaps between the ‘haves’ and ‘have nots’ in NRM regions in Australia (
 <xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robins and Dovers, 2007</xref>). Further, a range of co-management initiatives have been trialled that explicitly involve Indigenous peoples in a number of partnerships including Indigenous Protected Areas, jointly managed national parks (see Uluru and Kakadu) and Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA). These programs provide overlapping jurisdictional spheres to what may be occurring at State or regional levels: in South Australia, the State Government has produced an award-winning Climate Change Adaptation Plan, with devolved governance a central plank to its implementation. Yet it does not resource the implementation of specific strategies such as the one developed by the Arabana, largely due to the fact it does not ‘fit’ within existing recognised governance bodies or the criteria developed by other institutions.
