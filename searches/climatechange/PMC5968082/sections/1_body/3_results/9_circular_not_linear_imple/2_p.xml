<p id="p0170" class="p">Finally, analysis of the process of implementation of the Arabana Adaptation Strategy, launched in 2014 shows the fracture points between and the challenges of bringing together Western and Indigenous environmental governance regimes. Consistent with Indigenous ways of doing (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Howitt, 2001</xref>), the way in which the Arabana have approached implementation of the strategy is not as a linear process focussed around the paper

 <italic class="italic">other</italic> planning 
 <italic class="italic">processes</italic>. This is because the adaptation options they suggested have multiple uses, and so their implementation will also help the Arabana meet and succeed in a number of their other goals. For example, the adaptation strategy ignited interest from the Nature Conservancy, a non-government organisation, which, along with the Indigenous Land Corporation, provided funding for a Healthy Country Plan for parts of Arabana Country in 2014. This plan drew extensively from the adaptation strategy and built on its objectives by making climate change adaptation a key priority. In turn, that plan provided the Arabana with an opportunity to enter into discussions with government about the key issues identified in the adaptation strategy, including obtaining funding for rangers, negotiations about mining proposals on their country and for the development of management frameworks such as Indigenous Land Use Agreements. Further, the Arabana people are now members of a small group of Indigenous peoples in Australia that are working on adaptation options for Indigenous peoples more broadly, facilitated by the Social, Economic and Institutional Dimensions Network that is coordinated by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF). This circular, rather than linear approach, focussing on adaptation process and principles rather than the paper product, provides a more holistic and opportunistic perspective to adaptation overall; and ensures that Arabana values remain front and centre.
