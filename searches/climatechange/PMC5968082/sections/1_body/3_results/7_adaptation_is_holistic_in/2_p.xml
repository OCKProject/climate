<p id="p0150" class="p">The final stage of the adaptation process, working out what it 
 <italic class="italic">actually looked like</italic> resulted in a set of criteria that the Arabana people constructed as constituting effective adaptation (outlined in the Arabana Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, see 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref> below). Given the cultural diversity that characterises Indigenous peoples, we do not presume to argue these criteria would be applicable across all Indigenous groups; yet we argue that working out what these are for each group would ensure better engagement and success. These criteria reveal a holistic appreciation of how to embed adaptation in everyday priorities. While the criteria reflect a desire to find some redress for the past, they also show a pragmatic take on the idea of climate change adaptation, and a willingness to use it to achieve other wider aims. In subsequent consultation with policy makers on this strategy, one participant commented that the Arabana adaptation strategy ‘wasn't really adaptation, it's just more of the same’. Yet this synergy is the 
 <italic class="italic">point</italic> of culturally situated adaptation such as this one; unless adaptation is holistic in nature, and achieves multiple aims, in effect value adding to existing social, cultural and economic goals, it is unlikely to progress. The holistic nature of these criteria also shows how the connection to country and the inextricability of land and people that are part of Arabana culture and history becomes embedded and manifest in their own policy.
