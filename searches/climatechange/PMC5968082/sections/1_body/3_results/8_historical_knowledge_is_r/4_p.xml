It is however often ignored by policy makers in the prioritising of what is constructed within Western epistemes as the ‘real’ traditional knowledge. This study highlights that there is a vast store of recent historical Indigenous climatic, ecological knowledge and social history held by the Arabana people and we would suggest by many other Indigenous peoples. We argue that to ignore this historical knowledge is not only ignoring a valuable data source but reinforces colonial practice in the choosing of what is considered ‘appropriate’ cultural knowledge (according to Western mores) for inclusion into policy.
