<p id="p0110" class="p">Our results show that the Arabana have a millennia long history of responding to social and environmental change. They have a high level of local traditional and historical knowledge about climate change and as the following indicative quotes show, the Arabana people are not only worried about climate change, but have observed changes to the weather, flora and fauna over time:

  <p class="p">“I think climate change has a fair bit to do with it and I think it causing these extremes, I know it's always up and down, but the last drought was really – made everything so dead, and then the water in the lake after it had filled the first time, then filled again following year and now still got water in it – although drying out now. Quite unique – lot of volume of water as well. Rising higher than before” (Adelaide respondent 2, 2012).</p>

  <p class="p">“With climate change – the whole cycle of bush food as in kangaroos, you know… we can't get enough of that bush food and I know roos going into national park getting sanctuary – our country was good place years ago, lots of roos, turkeys, emus, and lots of goannas, lots of perentie [large lizards]. Where now it's like hard to find – you know there is supposed to be fruit ready for this time of year but they not ripe at right time or even there to fruit. Climate change is affecting growing of things and also affecting trees” (Oodnadatta respondent 2, 2012).</p>
