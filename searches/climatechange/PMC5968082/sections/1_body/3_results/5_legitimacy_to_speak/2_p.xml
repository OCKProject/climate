<p id="p0130" class="p">This deep and enduring value placed on culture and attachment to traditional country also meant that across all the places Arabana people now live, there was tension between how Arabana people felt about impacts on their traditional country as against their experience of climate impacts in the places they might live now. This in turn raised questions about who or what they had the rights to speak for and whether adaptation should be ‘here or there’. This concern over the legitimacy of ‘traditional rights to speak’ is typified by the (many) Arabana people from Darwin who were consistently wary of commenting on how to respond to climate change 
 <italic class="italic">in Darwin</italic>, because “that is Larrakia country, not mine” (Darwin respondent 4, 2014). Thus, despite having lived in multiple other places since colonisation, in some cases almost all of their lifetime, Arabana people still do not feel they belong to those areas and cannot speak about or for it.
