<p id="p0120" class="p">From the very beginning, we found that the impacts of colonisation set the discursive frame for discussion about climate change adaptation; initial decisions about the scope of the adaptation process focussed on the need to re-connect people with Arabana country. Over and again, interviews that began with discussions about climate change and adaptation turned to the history of the Arabana people and the ways in which they had been moved around and off their country. The cultural value and centrality of traditional country to Arabana identity, was so influential that the Arabana differentiated between place and people in the adaptation planning process:

  <p class="p">“You definitely need adaptation for the country. To keep it to be the beautiful place that it is, The place is changing so need to keep up with the change, That place is my heritage is my family – I want to take my kids out one day to show it to them It does get lost in towns very easily – for example, I don't even look aboriginal, who is there to teach me. Show me. Much harder to do in towns and cities than communities and lands”. (Alice Springs respondent 3 2012)</p>

  <p class="p">“Living on country is what some people want to do, some do live here but rest have moved away for work, but their heart is here, would live here all year round if they had income - income is a definite thing. Proper housing, proper cooling systems, have to have proper access to water and to make the area sustainable again – say you get flooded in you need to live off country, need to be able to hunt” (Adelaide respondent 2, 2012).</p>

  <p class="p">“Think it needs to be for country cos like when they are living in town got [sic] all they need, but on country that's where you feel the heat and coldness” (Marree respondent 2, 2012).</p>
