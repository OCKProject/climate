    <td align="left" class="td">“All the time I visit country – there's been a big change. Everything has changed, completely changed. In my days when I was there, when I was a child, well, there seemed to be lots of plants and animals around. Now they are dying out and there are hardly any animals left and there are other animals there now like cats and stuff. They moved in. That's a big change. When I lived in Kurdimurka, it was a big sandy creek with gum trees, but there no trees or sand anymore. Even Kurdimurka itself we used to gather lots of yams and stuff nothing there now, salt and sand killed it all” (Alice Springs respondent 1, 2102)
     <break class="break"/>“Weather unpredictable, it's getting hotter whereas one time you knew the season not any more it's all mixed up getting times when you should get rain and it doesn't then get too much rain, then sun not shining, I am sure animals are confused!” (Oodnadatta respondent 1, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“Used to be cold like it is now, and used to get a lot of wind and stuff, now the wind doesn't seem to be as strong, ground is all eroded, even camp at Kurdimurka, plenty of sand, level, now more or less on a sand hill, high! Country sand hills all gone, sunk down earth or soil there before all blown away! Wind has had effect and its hotter now too in summer time, and winter time bloody cold. Hotter now, hotter for longer maybe, always hot but more days now that are hot” (Alice Springs respondent 1, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“Used to be could get 17 lizards in just 20 km drive, not now, no goannas, or lizards, we got one on the road recently and it was fat, gee it was beautiful, and a couple of rabbit's. Printi is my father's dreaming, goanna is the smaller one, there is the frill necked ones and galta… used to eat wild pigeons too, the boys would get them with shanghai and galahs, there was no shop them days…” (Marree respondent 2, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“Lizards we had big ones, used to be lots and in great numbers, big goannas and stuff like that hardly any now except for little ones, beaded dragons hardly any round now. See them everywhere, the shingleback, the sleep lizard, hardly any more, in olden days they were in great numbers” (Alice Springs respondent 1, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“When we used to go to creek and get spring onions out, yonkas used to eat all those berries, thunka, wild tomato, you see them sometime now but used to be thick eh, and those poppas we used to step on them eh. No more. And the trees are not really shady now eh, they are starting to die off, mulla, mulgas going, used to be thick but no these here now you can look straight through them” (Marree respondent 2, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“In the last 25 years, like mobs of water are drying up earlier and quicker and vegetation around it is starting to die off- with the water dries quicker than it used to. Rainfall changed, we used to get mobs of good rains here, last good rain last year February then little rains after that, used to get a lot of rain around here” (Macumba Respondent 2, 2012).
     <break class="break"/>“Costs fuel too to go out and get a roo, can't afford it. The rain cycle not happening any more. We haven't had rain for 7–8 months supposed to have summer rain and we didn't have it. A constant worry, where is it leading into? Where is it taking us? How will people survive without water when the tanks run out? Can't afford to buy in water here” (Oodnadatta respondent 2, 2012).
