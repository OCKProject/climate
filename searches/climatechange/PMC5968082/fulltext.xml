Yet finding cultural and institutional &#x02018;fit&#x02019; within and between competing values-based climate and environmental management governance regimes remains an ongoing challenge. This paper reports on a collaborative research project with the Arabana people of central Australia, that resulted in the production of the first Indigenous community-based climate change adaptation strategy in Australia. We aimed to try and understand what conditions are needed to support Indigenous driven adaptation initiatives, if there are any cultural differences that need accounting for and how, once developed they be integrated into existing governance arrangements. Our analysis found that climate change adaptation is based on the centrality of the connection to &#x02018;country&#x02019; (traditional land), it needs to be aligned with cultural values, and focus on the building of adaptive capacity. We find that the development of climate change adaptation initiatives cannot be divorced from the historical context of how the Arabana experienced and collectively remember colonisation.

This is of particular importance, as for Indigenous Australians, country is a fundamental concept. The term &#x02018;country&#x02019; is commonly used to denote the traditional land/seas that belong to an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander cultural group. Indigenous peoples identify each other by their country, and &#x02018;caring for country&#x02019; is a term used to denote the traditional and ongoing management of Indigenous land and seas.

This definition has been interpreted in multiple ways. While top-down adaptation approaches have merit, community-based adaptation initiatives add further nuance (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Collen et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>) and are particularly appropriate for engaging Indigenous communities (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Alam et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Heltberg et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>). They also differ from top-down models of environmental management in two key ways. First, the developmental process encourages close involvement of local stakeholders, so they become participants (not just subjects) in the study, and the integration of culturally appropriate knowledge into adaptation plans is facilitated (<xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">McNamara, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">This bottom-up, participatory approach to adaptation planning also allows for the identification of specific local vulnerabilities, which builds upon experiences and knowledge at local levels by democratizing the enquiry (<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Huq and Reid, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Krimerman, 2001</xref>; <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="bib75" ref-type="bibr">Rojas Blanco, 2006</xref>). Giving a voice to local stakeholders early in a process also makes it harder to ignore identified priorities and issues (<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Garcia and Lescuyer, 2008</xref>) and helps make environmental management outcomes more sustainable (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Bodin and Norberg, 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Balteneu et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Community-based approaches can also build social capital (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ebi and Semenza, 2008</xref>, p. 502) and build understanding of generational observations and perceptions about change over time (<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Herman-Mercer et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0040">Local knowledge is a key resource (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">McNamara and Buggy, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Ensor and Berger, 2009</xref>) enabling observations of change at local levels to be factored into adaptation planning (<xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Riedlinger and Berkes, 2001</xref>) thus adding value to larger scale climate observations (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Barnett and Campbell, 2010</xref>). Indigenous farmers in Bolivia for example, associate their observations of climate change with other social and environmental changes, with climate change all part of a cycle (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Boillat and Berkes, 2013</xref>). The incorporation of scale is an argument advanced by <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">MacKinnon (2010)</xref> who says that community-based adaptation needs to be cognisant of wider scalar practice, a point particularly relevant in the multi-level and scalar governance regime that occurs in the Australian context. Environmental management can then occur as a social process that acknowledges heterogeneity and different socio-cultural contexts and supports adaptation at multiple scales and within multi-governance regimes (<xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">McNamara and Buggy, 2016</xref>). Local adaptation planning can also help build resilience as shown in examples from toolkits for climate adaptation planning in Cambodia and Vietnam show (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Jacobson and Chanseng, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Tran et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Nonetheless, there remain many challenges in executing adaptation, including understanding the role of values, and the need to understand institutions (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Ford et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Spires et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). There are also psychological barriers to adaptation, typified by <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Gifford (2011)</xref> as the &#x02018;dragons of inaction&#x02019; which include limited cognition about the problem, and a contest between different world views. In other words, it is too easy to over romanticise the notion of &#x02018;community&#x02019; and run the danger of over-emphasising the vulnerability rather than agency of such groups. It is important to acknowledge the fact that Indigenous peoples have often been active agents in landscape and environmental change (over millennia). Studies of the Cree community of Wemindji (<xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Sayles and Mulrennan, 2010</xref>), Panama (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Apgar et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and Indigenous Australia (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Gammage, 2011</xref>) are just two examples highlighting how cultural practices build leadership, social networks and the capacity to support transformative adaptation (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Apgar et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">The investigation of power relations is another important determinant that affects the success (or not) of community adaptation trials; the legitimacy of the community to speak is crucial (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">Panditharatne, 2016</xref>). As <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Dodman and Mitlin (2013</xref>, p. 645) note, there is a tendency &#x0201c;to assume that communities are simple homogeneous entities, yet communities also involve a variety of power relationships and exclusions&#x0201d;. Community based adaptation programs in Indonesia (<xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Yoseph-Paulus and Hindmarsh, 2016</xref>) and Nepal (<xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">Regmi et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>), have also been hampered by a lack of inter-sectoral coordination and inability to accrue benefits equally across the community.</p><p id="p0055">The building of community-based adaptation in Indigenous contexts therefore is a challenging enterprise and adds yet another layer to the already often huge set of challenges Indigenous people face. Investigating how they can be supported, and what cultural difference may affect their development and implementation, can yield important insights that can help refine current and contribute to the success of future programs. Given this context, we now specifically report the results of a five-year research project that resulted in a community-based adaptation program developed by the Arabana people, traditional owners of the Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre region of central Australia, which is in the state of South Australia (2010&#x02013;2015). The aim of the project was first to assess the vulnerability of the Arabana to climate change, and second, to build a community-based climate change adaptation strategy responding to the findings of the assessment. We report on the results of the latter. In so doing we sought to understand what conditions are needed to support Indigenous driven adaptation initiatives, if there are any cultural differences that need accounting for and how, once developed they be re-integrated into existing governance arrangements. While our results are based on our work with the Arabana people, we suggest they offer useful reflections relevant to other Indigenous peoples and climate change adaptation planning projects.</p><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>The Arabana people</title><p id="p0060">The Arabana people are an Indigenous group, whose traditional country is located in central Australia and includes Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre. Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre is unique. It is Australia's largest salt-lake, located 647 km north east of Adelaide in the state of South Australia, and its catchment spans Queensland, the Northern Territory, South Australia, and New South Wales. The catchment is described as comprising between one fifth to one sixth of the Australian continent. Its drainage basin is over 1.2 million square kilometres, and at 15.2 metres below sea level in its eastern perimeter, it is Australia's lowest point (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Nursey-Bray et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). The region experiences little rain, and the lake floods on average only four times a century; although between 2006 and 2016 there have been many more rain events than usual.</p><p id="p0065">Originally named after the English explorer Edward John Eyre, the lake was renamed from Lake Eyre to Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre in 2012 to recognise the ongoing traditional Indigenous ownership by the Arabana people. The region is also the traditional land for the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjata (APY) Lands, and other Indigenous peoples who have inhabited the area for thousands of years. Today, there are about 57,000 people living in the Kathi Thanda-Lake Eyre basin working in pastoralism, tourism, mining and petroleum; as well as township-based work such as retail, education, medical and other services. The traditional country of the Arabana people is at the centre of this region and includes many sites of sacred spiritual significance to them.</p><p id="p0070">The impact of colonisation was significant for the Arabana, and resulted in their dispersal from their country, with populations now living in Darwin, Alice Springs, Marree, Port Augusta and Adelaide (see Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> for details). As <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Fergie et&#x000a0;al. (2013</xref>, 32) note: &#x0201c;The fault line of invasion undermined the grounds of their adaptive social system. Arabana people have had to adapt to the tectonic changes wrought by colonisation&#x0201d;. This included the incursion during the late 1850s by explorers, who arrived hoping to establish pastoral businesses on land they took from the Arabana and other groups in the region. In particular, the explorer John Stuart used mound springs (which carry significant cultural value to the Arabana), as &#x0201c;a conduit of colonial invasion and Arabana control and care of their country and their people had been usurped&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Fergie et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>, 36). Following this appropriation of land for pastoralism, between 1870 and 1872, the overland Telegraph route was laid in 1884, also cutting through Arabana country. During 1889, a railway was then laid along the mound springs, also facilitating further colonial intrusion upon Arabana country (<xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Litchfield, 1983</xref>). For the Arabana, these events meant that they were moved into ration stations, and to work on pastoral properties as well as the railway (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Paterson, 2005</xref>). As with many Indigenous peoples at the time, the Arabana also suffered from the introduction of diseases such as influenza, documented in 1919 by Dr Herbert Basedow, who writes:<disp-quote><p>The recent influenza epidemic was disastrous, having in many centres, like Hergott Springs [Marree] and Oodnadatta, almost completely annihilated the resident groups. We were surprised also to note the appalling decrease in the numbers at Anna Creek, once a veritable stronghold of the local tribe when the station was in the hands of Messrs Hogarth and Warren. The principal camps at which we found the remnants of local groups congregated were at Finniss Springs, Stuart's Creek, Anna Creek, Oodnadatta, [and thence out of Arabana country].

This is because its owner, Francis Warren, married an Arabana woman. In the 1930s, he invited the United Aborigines Mission to set up a school and church on Finniss Springs and a settlement was established. This history is important because the legacy of colonisation remains very real to many Arabana people, with some having grown-up in and around Finniss Springs and with many holding memories of dispersion, most notably caused by the railway that moved through their country. Consequently, the course of this history is influential in how Arabana people construct knowledge and respond to land management issues about their country, including climate change adaptation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p id="p0080">This project was conducted by an interdisciplinary team which included anthropologists, climate scientists, adaptation researchers, a communication specialist, two Indigenous Professors, (one of whom is an Arabana woman) and the Chairman of the Arabana Aboriginal Corporation. The Arabana Aboriginal Corporation (AAC) is the focal (and legal) point for all formal business on behalf of the Arabana. Based on community-based and participatory methodologies, (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Arbon, 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Rigney, 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib87" ref-type="bibr">AIATSIS 2012</xref>) we worked with the Arabana Corporation and people at all stages of the research, co-involving them in development of the research questions, fieldwork, analysis of results, and preparation of the final reports. We also aimed to build community capacity in research, which took the form of training Arabana people to undertake research interviews for the team. Fourteen Arabana people were employed to work on the project. As such, we ensured that Arabana people were at the heart of the research, a process outlined by <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Arbon and Rigney (2014)</xref> who were the two Indigenous researchers involved in the research team. This paper is the complement to theirs.</p><p id="p0085">The project received ethics approval from the Human Ethics Research Committee, at the University of Adelaide and it was formally endorsed (in minutes) and approved to proceed by the Arabana Board of Directors. We conducted two periods of fieldwork, in which time we interviewed over 120 Arabana people and a further 25 participated in a community-based adaptation workshop. Arabana people were interviewed from across all the places that they now live, not just those living near or on traditional country, and we worked with both men and women, youth and Elders. By doing so, we not only documented information about Arabana country but contemporary places of residence, over a period of 100 years.</p><p id="p0090">The process we used to collect information took place in four stages. In stage one, we commissioned a science impact report which identified what climate impacts had been observed and were predicted to be; not only for Arabana country but also for all the major population settlements where Arabana people now live. The second stage involved working together with Indigenous team members and the community to craft appropriate communications about these impacts, including a short film, flyers, and a web site. These communications were then used throughout the project to engage Arabana people in the project. The third stage involved two teams going out into the field. One team undertook a study into the adaptive capacity of the Arabana. The second team undertook a perception of risk and vulnerability study and documented Arabana suggestions for ideas of adaptation to those risks. A community adaptation workshop concluded the project and was attended by Arabana people from all over Australia. This meeting was used to present final project results, and then workshop and get agreement on the final Arabana adaptation strategy. This strategy was then endorsed formally by the Arabana Board of Directors (See <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Nursey-Bray et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0095">We adopted a <italic>values-based</italic> approach for conducting the research work and then analysing our data. Values-based approaches have merit in helping understand the causes and significance of different cultural responses to climate change; indeed culture and values can affect adaptive pathways (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Adger et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Such values can be &#x02018;held&#x02019; as in they are associated with ideas, behaviours, outcomes and experiences, while values attaching worth to an asset may be delineated as &#x02018;assigned values&#x02019;. <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Reser and Bentrupperbaumer (2005)</xref> also discuss the difference between &#x02018;intrinsic&#x02019; values, those that designate value to an asset in and of itself to &#x02018;use&#x02019; values, that is those that are &#x02019;used&#x02019; in some way.

They have a high level of local traditional and historical knowledge about climate change and as the following indicative quotes show, the Arabana people are not only worried about climate change, but have observed changes to the weather, flora and fauna over time:<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;I think climate change has a fair bit to do with it and I think it causing these extremes, I know it's always up and down, but the last drought was really &#x02013; made everything so dead, and then the water in the lake after it had filled the first time, then filled again following year and now still got water in it &#x02013; although drying out now.

One Arabana leader said: &#x0201c;just get people back on country and you will be fine&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Stuart, 2013</xref> pers. comm.). As the following sections highlight, colonisation as subject and process, was the anchor point and conceptual lens that framed all discussions about climate change and managing or adapting to it. These results provide important insights for delivering environmental governance in this area, and we provide a synthesis of them below. Given the diversity of Indigenous nations in Australia and the world, we do not suggest any universality about these insights, but they do provide food for thought in relation to some of the challenges inherent in developing and then operationalising community based environmental management programs in the longer term.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><label>4.1</label><title>Adaptation is for Arabana country rather than Arabana people</title><p id="p0120">From the very beginning, we found that the impacts of colonisation set the discursive frame for discussion about climate change adaptation; initial decisions about the scope of the adaptation process focussed on the need to re-connect people with Arabana country. Over and again, interviews that began with discussions about climate change and adaptation turned to the history of the Arabana people and the ways in which they had been moved around and off their country. The cultural value and centrality of traditional country to Arabana identity, was so influential that the Arabana differentiated between place and people in the adaptation planning process:<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;You definitely need adaptation for the country.

This in turn raised questions about who or what they had the rights to speak for and whether adaptation should be &#x02018;here or there&#x02019;. This concern over the legitimacy of &#x02018;traditional rights to speak&#x02019; is typified by the (many) Arabana people from Darwin who were consistently wary of commenting on how to respond to climate change <italic>in Darwin</italic>, because &#x0201c;that is Larrakia country, not mine&#x0201d; (Darwin respondent 4, 2014). Thus, despite having lived in multiple other places since colonisation, in some cases almost all of their lifetime, Arabana people still do not feel they belong to those areas and cannot speak about or for it.</p><p id="p0135">This was an ongoing refrain throughout the project and reinforced a collective decision that the adaptation strategy must be for Arabana <italic>country</italic>. This decision was also partly made on the basis that they felt as a <italic>people</italic> that they would adapt over time: &#x0201c;Climate change is an issue, but you can adapt to anything, you got to do it with what you got&#x0201d; (Adelaide respondent 1, 2012). In this way, colonisation was also used to assert the resilience of the Arabana people and ground the decision for adaptation planning to focus on country; they reasoned that if they could adapt and survive colonisation, they could also survive/adapt to climate change, but they were not sure the country could do the same.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><label>4.3</label><title>Values matter: adaptation priorities align with Indigenous cultural values</title><p id="p0140">In subsequently developing their ideas for adaptation action per se, Arabana core values, (as shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were aligned to the adaptation options they put forward. We identified a correlation between multiple adaptation options and a series of core Arabana values, including the values of country, culture, history and livelihood (shelter, food and water). For example, the right to have and maintain economic livelihoods was asserted as a value that needed embedding in adaptation and became inextricably linked to the assertion that it would redress some of the economic and social inequalities that remain the legacy of this history of colonial dislocation for the Arabana. Adaptation was constructed as a means by which economic options could be reinforced and the building of adaptive capacity achieved by the resourcing of Arabana people to go back and live on country:<disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;How are you going to accommodate projects on our country that can provide economic independence on our own two feet &#x02013; don't want always to have to go cap in hand to government for assistance&#x0201d; (Darwin respondent 7, 2012)</p></disp-quote><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;Got to be some kind of work you know.

Given the cultural diversity that characterises Indigenous peoples, we do not presume to argue these criteria would be applicable across all Indigenous groups; yet we argue that working out what these are for each group would ensure better engagement and success. These criteria reveal a holistic appreciation of how to embed adaptation in everyday priorities. While the criteria reflect a desire to find some redress for the past, they also show a pragmatic take on the idea of climate change adaptation, and a willingness to use it to achieve other wider aims. In subsequent consultation with policy makers on this strategy, one participant commented that the Arabana adaptation strategy &#x02018;wasn't really adaptation, it's just more of the same&#x02019;. Yet this synergy is the <italic>point</italic> of culturally situated adaptation such as this one; unless adaptation is holistic in nature, and achieves multiple aims, in effect value adding to existing social, cultural and economic goals, it is unlikely to progress.

Consistent with Indigenous ways of doing (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Howitt, 2001</xref>), the way in which the Arabana have approached implementation of the strategy is not as a linear process focussed around the paper <italic>product</italic>; instead, they have used the strategy in a circular manner, employing multiple dimensions of it, as a part of ongoing and <italic>other</italic> planning <italic>processes</italic>. This is because the adaptation options they suggested have multiple uses, and so their implementation will also help the Arabana meet and succeed in a number of their other goals. For example, the adaptation strategy ignited interest from the Nature Conservancy, a non-government organisation, which, along with the Indigenous Land Corporation, provided funding for a Healthy Country Plan for parts of Arabana Country in 2014. This plan drew extensively from the adaptation strategy and built on its objectives by making climate change adaptation a key priority. In turn, that plan provided the Arabana with an opportunity to enter into discussions with government about the key issues identified in the adaptation strategy, including obtaining funding for rangers, negotiations about mining proposals on their country and for the development of management frameworks such as Indigenous Land Use Agreements. Further, the Arabana people are now members of a small group of Indigenous peoples in Australia that are working on adaptation options for Indigenous peoples more broadly, facilitated by the Social, Economic and Institutional Dimensions Network that is coordinated by the National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility (NCCARF). This circular, rather than linear approach, focussing on adaptation process and principles rather than the paper product, provides a more holistic and opportunistic perspective to adaptation overall; and ensures that Arabana values remain front and centre.</p><p id="p0175">However, this approach to implementation is <italic>not</italic> consistent with Western (colonial) modes of decision making and hence achieving a cultural &#x02018;fit&#x02019; between this initiative and the multiple other forms of environmental management arrangements in the State and nationally remains a challenge. In the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre region, multiple jurisdictional and policy arrangements exist at local institutional, government, state, and national levels. For example, at a national level, Australia has been divided up into 56 Natural Resource Management (NRM) regions, where resources have been devolved by the government to NRM Boards (composed of community representatives and paid staff), who in turn implement a range of environmental management activities. Yet as highlighted in <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Curtis et&#x000a0;al. (2014)</xref>, both in Australia and New Zealand, even models of devolved NRM governance are incompatible with adaptive management. There remain gaps between the &#x02018;haves&#x02019; and &#x02018;have nots&#x02019; in NRM regions in Australia (<xref rid="bib74" ref-type="bibr">Robins and Dovers, 2007</xref>). Further, a range of co-management initiatives have been trialled that explicitly involve Indigenous peoples in a number of partnerships including Indigenous Protected Areas, jointly managed national parks (see Uluru and Kakadu) and Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUA). These programs provide overlapping jurisdictional spheres to what may be occurring at State or regional levels: in South Australia, the State Government has produced an award-winning Climate Change Adaptation Plan, with devolved governance a central plank to its implementation. Yet it does not resource the implementation of specific strategies such as the one developed by the Arabana, largely due to the fact it does not &#x02018;fit&#x02019; within existing recognised governance bodies or the criteria developed by other institutions.</p><p id="p0180">Further, organisational disjuncture, relating to lack of coordination between government departments, and in turn with communities, is a recurring theme in the implementation of community-based adaptation (<xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr">Srinivasan et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). In Australia, while different government departments and policies are relevant to the management of the multiple (not all climate) risks identified by the Arabana (and at multiple scales), they are not institutionally linked to each other, nor obliged to connect to each other in day-to-day business operations. Indeed, other studies find that attempts to &#x02018;upscale&#x02019; context specific adaptation projects, such as this one, into wider governance frames, results in piecemeal adaptation (<xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr">Spires et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>; <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Ayre and Forsyth, 2009</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">Thus, while climate change impacts remain, the capacity to implement the core elements of the adaptation plan for the Arabana remains piecemeal and opportunistic and within most of these arrangements, the Arabana have minimal control or decision-making power. They remain both subject to wider, as well their own internal, governance regimes across multiple scales and geographical regions. Their own culturally driven and often informal modes of governance are largely invisible and certainly not catered for in planning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Discussion</title><sec id="sec5.1"><label>5.1</label><title>Collaborative and shared governance?</title><p id="p0190">These results, while specific to the Arabana, can provide some wider implications of meaning and relevance to other Indigenous contexts. The Arabana are trying to assert their own sovereignty by building their own responses to a challenge like climate change but need to find ways to integrate their activities with pre-existing, and largely, Western dominated land management models. These models are constructed within Western conservation paradigms and embedded within colonial frames which still influence how NRM is practiced and how broader policy is established (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Barbour and Schlesinger, 2012</xref>). Further such formal governance regimes can camouflage the abuse of power imbalances that can occur, and which are often avoided in more informal governance processes, such as those occurring within and between Indigenous communities (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Hill, 2007</xref>).</p><p id="p0195">The development of the adaptation strategy for the Arabana highlights that policy around Indigenous climate adaptation must include a recognition of the legacy of colonisation, be holistically connected with livelihoods and the environment, and aim to build adaptive capacity. Our analysis shows that adaptation is not and cannot be divorced from wider and higher priority issues of cultural survival, political power, and place based economic autonomy. We argue that the success of adaptation as a form of environmental management requires new models of collaborative and shared environmental governance, underpinned by an acknowledgement of the relationship between, and legacy of, colonisation (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Howitt et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Jordan et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).

As <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Barber and Jackson (2015)</xref> find in a study on the management of dams and diversions in northern Australia, historical knowledge plays an informative role in understanding Indigenous perspectives in environmental management. Finding ways of embedding justice and equity as key governance principles is also a key step and implies not just recognition of Indigenous agency within and equitable involvement in climate adaptation policy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Adger, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Adger and Kelly, 1999</xref>; <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Razzaque et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>) but a re-distribution of power in decision making.

They want to be active partners in developing better understandings of the environment and implementers of management that reflects shared agendas.</p></disp-quote></p><p id="p0205">Such a collaborative decision-making system would also recognise different Indigenous knowledge systems (pre-and postcolonial), that include an explicit commitment to the co-production of knowledge which can then help to promote the cross transfer of skills, build trust and recognise the validity of Indigenous knowledge systems (<xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">MacLean and Cullen, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Bohensky et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0210">As such, governments and other actors who have the power to make decisions within multiple governance regimes (such as the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre region is), can work together to find cultural entry points for Indigenous groups to actively participate in governance, in ways that are appropriate for them (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Folke et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>). Understanding that Indigenous people engage in environmental management activities for multiple reasons (over and above economic remuneration), in order to &#x02018;look after country&#x02019; is fundamentally important (<xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">Zander et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>). New forms of environmental management could be polycentric &#x0201c;comprising multiple decision centres located across different levels of decision making and able to perform their respective roles with substantive autonomy&#x0201d; (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Curtis et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, 185).</p><p id="p0215">There are multiple benefits to undertaking collaborative governance approaches, ones that recognise colonial impacts, to building adaptation for and with Indigenous peoples. For example, healthy country is often correlated with healthy people, with studies highlighting the many health benefits that accrue as a result of Indigenous involvement in resource management (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Burgess et&#x000a0;al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Garnett et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>). This is clear in our own conversations with the Arabana people, where the [ill] health of the country makes the Elders sad: &#x0201c;The old people say that if the land is sad, the people are sad. If you look at it now it's not like I it was when they were growing up, so they are sad&#x0201d; (Oodnadatta respondent 1, 2012).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec6"><label>6</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="p0220">Ultimately, our study demonstrates not only the endurance of values such as country, culture, and livelihoods, but also the fact that they are understood within an historical continuum going back millennia. Within this continuum, colonisation remains an active agent in how environmental management is constructed and then implemented in the present by the Arabana people.</p><p id="p0225">The development of future community-based climate change adaptation initiatives is partly dependent on the capacity of other environmental management institutions to adapt their regimes in ways that recognise and incorporate different forms of governance and models of environmental management in socially just and equitable ways. As <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Carter and Hill (2007</xref>, 43) note: &#x0201c;linking informal and formal governance structures and canvassing a range of governance modalities will ultimately connect the human behaviours and governance structures needed to progress indigenous environmental management in Australia&#x0201d;.</p><p id="p0230">This is both the future opportunity and collective challenge for groups such as the Arabana and policy makers in the effort to establish and persist with adaptation initiatives that are decolonised and enable all parties to build more effective environmental management.</p></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Declarations</title><sec id="sec7.1"><title>Author contribution statement</title><p id="p0235">Melissa Nursey-Bray: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data; Wrote the paper.</p><p id="p0240">Robert Palmer: Conceived and designed the experiments; Performed the experiments; Analyzed and interpreted the data; Contributed reagents, materials, analysis tools or data.</p></sec><sec id="sec7.2"><title>Funding statement</title><p id="p0245">This project was funded by the <funding-source id="gs1">National Climate Change Adaptation Research Facility</funding-source>, Australia, based at the Griffith University, Queensland.</p></sec><sec id="sec7.3"><title>Competing interest statement</title><p id="p0250">The authors declare no conflict of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec7.4"><title>Additional information</title><p id="p0255">No additional information is available for this paper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Adger</surname><given-names>W.N.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Social capital, collective action, and adaptation to climate change</article-title><source>Econ.
