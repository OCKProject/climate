<p class="p">Future range expansions within the native range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> are positive; however, range contractions are of concern. The distribution maps from this study could be used to make decisions about conservation implications, particularly on islands where climate is projected to become unsuitable for this species by 2100. The projected distribution maps identify some areas within its native range where this species can persist as anthropogenic climate change progresses. In such cases, focusing management efforts on the changing disturbance patterns, both natural and anthropogenic may be useful. The investigation into the response of species such as 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> to changes in climate serves a dual purpose. The results can be used to inform biosecurity planning by assessing threat levels to native biodiversity on islands where it is introduced and invasive. They can also inform management and conservation strategies on islands where it is native but has become dominant due to other factors such as disturbance.
