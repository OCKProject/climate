<p class="p">The potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M.Â peltata</italic> was modeled for historical climate and under future climate scenarios. The variable impacts that climate change may have on this species' potential distribution in the Pacific region were highlighted. The model provided a good fit to the current distribution of this species in the region as well as the Australian distribution which was reserved for model validation purposes. In general, range expansions are indicated for Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu while a reduction in climatically suitable areas is indicated for PNG and Solomon Islands under future climate scenarios.
