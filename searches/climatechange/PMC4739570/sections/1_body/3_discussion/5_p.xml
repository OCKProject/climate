<p class="p">All species may respond in unpredictable ways to multiple interacting factors associated with global change and this also applies to species that behave invasively (Bradley et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Rising temperatures and altered precipitation together with increased availability of resources from higher carbon dioxide levels and nitrogen deposition, as well as land use change will impact invasive species distributions (Dukes

Integrated assessments that investigate large‐scale changes to entire ecosystems in the Pacific region will be beneficial for managers coping with the impacts of global change on biodiversity. However, this can be a demanding task, both in terms of funding and organization due to the comprehensive and interdisciplinary nature of such assessments (Bradley et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The findings from species‐specific studies such as the one reported here can be useful for managing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the short term but also potentially contribute to broad scale assessments in the long‐term.
