<p class="p">Some archipelagos within the introduced and invasive range of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> were identified as remaining climatically suitable for this species well into the future with range expansions projected for some of the small islands in these archipelagos that currently do not have 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic>. In these cases strategic control measures will be required to prevent its spread to presently unoccupied islands. The isolation and smaller size of these islands place them in a better position to prevent entry into areas that are currently unsuitable for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> but will become climatically suitable in the future. However, for such measures to be successful, quarantine regulations and their enforcement will need to be strengthened. Furthermore, simple and low‐cost strategies such as weed alerts and low‐cost surveillance, especially around airports and ports, may be a worthwhile investment on the part of biosecurity agencies in these archipelagos (Taylor et al.

 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> by the end of the century is encouraging, although many islands in these areas will likely remain climatically suitable in the short term. These results should be useful in prioritizing areas for eradication and in determining areas where containment would be cost‐effective (Taylor and Kumar
