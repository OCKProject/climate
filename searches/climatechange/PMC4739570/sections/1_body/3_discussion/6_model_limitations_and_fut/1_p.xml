<p class="p">CLIMEX is based on the response of a species to climate and does not explicitly include nonclimatic factors such as dispersal potential and biotic interactions in the modeling process Taylor et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>). The uncertainty related to future global greenhouse gas emission patterns also introduce further uncertainty to model projections (Kriticos et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Therefore, the results presented here should be interpreted as providing an 
 <italic class="italic">indication</italic> of the direction and magnitude of change that may be expected in the future (Taylor et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012b</xref>). The distribution maps provided here show areas of climatic suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> and should not be treated as predicted future distributions. Other factors like lack of dispersal opportunities will also play a role in this species' potential future distribution.
