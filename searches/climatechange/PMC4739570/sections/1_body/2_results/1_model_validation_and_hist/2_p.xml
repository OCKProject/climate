<p class="p">The potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> together with its occurrence in Australia is shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece31915-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. Approximately 77% of the occurrence records fall within the highly suitable category. In Australia, the model projects coastal areas of Northern Queensland from Cape York to Bowen as well as small parts of the coastal region of Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory to have suitable to highly suitable climate for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Central Australia and other parts of the continent are projected to be climatically unsuitable for this species mainly due to dry stress based on its high rainfall requirements (Paynter et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>).
