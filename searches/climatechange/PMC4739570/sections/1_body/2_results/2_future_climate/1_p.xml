<p class="p">Large areas in the region will become unsuitable or marginal for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> with a further change in climatic suitability from highly suitable to merely suitable by the end of the century (Table 
 <xref rid="ece31915-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The locations of these changes in climatic suitability by the end of the century are shown in Figures

The general trends indicate range expansions in Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu for this species while range contractions are indicated for PNG and Solomon Islands by the end of the century. The major change observed in the potential distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> in Fiji occurs in the central region of Viti Levu. Under current climate, this region is projected as climatically unsuitable but becomes highly suitable under future climate. Furthermore, the climate on the islands of Vanua Levu and Kadavu remain highly suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> until 2100 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In Hawaii, range expansions are seen in Kaua'i, O'ahu, Molokai, Maui and the northern coast of the main island of Hawaii (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). Additionally, the two smaller islands of Lana'i and Kaho'olawe, which are unsuitable for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> under current climate, become suitable under future climate scenarios, particularly with the MIROC‐H GCM.
