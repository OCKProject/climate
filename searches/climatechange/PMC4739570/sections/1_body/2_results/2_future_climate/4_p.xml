<p class="p">Islands in the Solomon Islands archipelago remain climatically suitable for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> until 2030 (S5). By the end of the century, however, climatic suitability for this species diminishes on all the islands, especially under the A2 scenario. The islands of Guadalcanal, Makira, Rennell and Malaita remain highly suitable until 2100 under the A1B scenario with the MIROC‐H GCM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). In Vanuatu, range expansions are indicated for islands which are unsuitable under current climate, such as Erromango and Tanna. Further increases in suitable range for 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> can be seen on Espiritu Santo where larger sections of the island become highly suitable compared to current climate (Fig.
