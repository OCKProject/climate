 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> is a common species found in dry lowland and mesic inland vegetation types in the Pacific region (Meyer 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>); however, in Samoa, it has been noted as a dominant species on the landscape only during the past two decades (Kirkham 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). It reproduces both vegetatively and by seed; however, the seed viability rates are reported to be low (Bacon 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1982</xref>). Viable seeds can be transported by sea to new islands (Hacker 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) but the distance and duration that seeds can travel is largely unknown. Dispersal by sea may have led to its presence on the remote islands of the Pacific region. It is not known whether animals play a role in pollination and dispersal of this species as according to Kirkham (
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>), in Samoa, “ants were observed in the corolla of the 
 <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> flowers, but never bees or wasps that were frequently seen on flowers of other species”.
