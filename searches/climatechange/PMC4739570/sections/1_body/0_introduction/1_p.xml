<p class="p">Many biological invaders contribute to biodiversity loss by causing the extinction of native species (Sax et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). An invasive species is an introduced or non‐native species that becomes established and spread outside its native range (Sax et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Invasive species are seen as one of the key drivers of change in island ecosystems and a major threat to native island biodiversity (Reaser et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>; Ricciardi 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Island ecosystems are highly susceptible to biological invasions (Mueller‐Dombois and Fosberg 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). The Pacific region includes three of the 35 global biodiversity hotspots (East Melanesian Islands, New Caledonia and Polynesia‐Micronesia) with numerous endemic and native species (Myers et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Habitat destruction and invasive species are reported as the two main causes of species' extinctions in this region (Sherley et al. 
 <xref rid="ece31915-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). These non‐native species often have highly detrimental impacts on native biota, leading to alterations at the community, the ecosystem, and the landscape levels (Vitousek et al.
