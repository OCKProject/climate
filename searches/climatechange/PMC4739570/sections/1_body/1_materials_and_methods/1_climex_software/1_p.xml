The final output of the CLIMEX model is the Ecoclimatic index (EI) value which indicates the climatic suitability of a location for the persistence of the species under investigation. The EI values range from 0 to 100; a location with an EI value of 0 is deemed unsuitable, 1–10 indicate marginal habitats, 10–20 indicate suitable habitats and values &gt;20 are highly suitable (Sutherst and Maywald
