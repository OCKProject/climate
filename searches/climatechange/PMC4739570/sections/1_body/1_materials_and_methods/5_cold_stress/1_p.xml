 <italic class="italic">M. peltata's</italic> global distribution were defined using two cold stress mechanisms. The cold stress temperature threshold (TTCS) was set at 10°C with the stress accumulation rate (THCS) set at −0.003 week

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. These two mechanisms ensured that the potential distribution was restricted to the known northern and southern limits (Taylor et al.
