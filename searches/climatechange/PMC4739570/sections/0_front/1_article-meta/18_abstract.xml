  <italic class="italic">Merremia peltata</italic> is a species with uncertain status in the island nations of the Pacific region. It has been designated introduced and invasive in some countries whereas it is considered native in others. Recent increase in its abundance across some island landscapes have led to calls for its designation as an invasive species of environmental concern with biological control being suggested as a control strategy. Climate change will add to the complications of managing this species since changes in climate will influence its range limits. In this study, we develop a process‐oriented niche model of 
  <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> using 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">CLIMEX</styled-content> to investigate the impacts of climate change on its potential distribution. Information on the climatic requirements of 
  <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> and its current geographic distribution were used to calibrate the model. The results indicate that under current climate, 273,132 km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> of the land area in the region is climatically unsuitable or marginal for 
  <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> whereas 664,524 km
  <sup class="sup">2</sup> is suitable to highly suitable. Under current climate, areas of climatic suitability for 
  <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic> were identified on the archipelagos of Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu. By the end of the century, some archipelagos like Fiji, Hawaii, New Caledonia and Vanuatu will probably become more suitable while 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">PNG</styled-content> and Solomon Islands become less suitable for 
  <italic class="italic">M. peltata</italic>. The results can be used to inform biosecurity planning, management and conservation strategies on islands.
