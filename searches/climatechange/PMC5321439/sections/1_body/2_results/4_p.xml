<p class="p">The basic modeling frameworks, including species distribution (SDM) and vegetation models varied among both jurisdictions and species (
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Geographically, SDMs were generally available for the entire breeding range, while more specific vegetation response models were largely restricted to the US portion of the basin. For eastern meadowlark both the Canadian-based CC-QBD and US-based CC-TABA modeling frameworks were used to evaluate changing climate envelopes and habitat. For the 2041–2070 time horizon the CC-QBD SDM models predicted a net gain in habitat area resulting in a northward expansion of 307 km from 1990 to 2070 (

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, the grassland habitats that eastern meadowlarks inhabit are unlikely to move northward as quickly, as the northern region lies on the boreal shield, where grasslands are rare. In contrast, the CC-TABA models predicted a decrease in abundance in the western part of the eastern meadowlark range by 2100 and do not predict any movement in the core of the range or northern expansion [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Model predictions encompassed the eastern US, but did not include any predictions north of the border due to a lack of climate-vegetation modeling in Canada. The overall CCVI score for meadowlark was highly vulnerable (
