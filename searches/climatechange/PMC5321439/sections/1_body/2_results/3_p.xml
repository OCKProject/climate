<p class="p">Predictive temperature data required for the suggested GCMs and scenarios for CCVI were available in GIS for only for the US portion of the basin, although the issue here may be related to technical problems with web-based tools to generate data for a specific geographic area rather than management decisions to restrict extent of data. To resolve this issue, we used predictive CC data that included both the US and Canadian portions of the basin, and that was based on a mid-century (2050s), ensemble GCM and a medium emission scenario (RCP 4.5) and is roughly equivalent to the CCVI suggested A1B scenario. An additional consideration was GIS conversion of Celsius to Fahrenheit, as the North American predictive temperature data we used was mapped in Celsius while the CCVI requires estimates in Fahrenheit. We had no issues estimating the severity of the exposure to climate change in the southern US and Central American overwintering grounds as all the necessary data was available at the CCVI site [
