<p class="p">Wood thrushes are mature forest species found in mixed wood and deciduous forests, often preferring previously disturbed sites [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. They nest in interior edges [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], selecting deciduous trees such as American beech (

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. For wood thrush the CC-QBD model predicts a range expansion with an increase in habitat area by 25.5%, a northward range expansion of 28 km/decade for an overall range extension of 304 km by 2041–2070 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172668.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>) with an additional 119 km by 2071–2100 [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, the deciduous trees that wood thrushes select for nesting are unlikely to move northward as quickly. The northern range limit lies on the boreal shield, where nesting tree species such as American elm, American beech and red maple are rare. In contrast, the US-specific CC-TABA CC-vegetation models predicted a decrease in abundance in the western and southern parts of the wood thrush range [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. The top predictors in this model were red maple distribution, annual precipitation, American beech distribution, American elm distribution, and the mean difference between July and January temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Given the jurisdictional boundary of the modeling, it is difficult to extrapolate the changes at the northern range limit into Canada; however, current research suggests that American beech may decline throughout its range across eastern US, while American elm may increase within the northern extent of its range across the northern US [
