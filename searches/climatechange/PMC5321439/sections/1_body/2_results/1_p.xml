<p class="p">From a multinational perspective, the CCVI enabled a basic CCVA for our focal migratory birds, and allowed relevant information to be incorporated from Canada, US and Central America into the CCVA (
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). The CCVI considered i) exposure of the species to climate change within the breeding range, ii) indirect climate exposure resulting from human responses to climate change, iii) sensitivity to climate exposure and adaptive capacity, iv) an exposure index for the overwintering grounds, v) modeled distributional changes (or changes in climate envelope) expected under specific climate change scenarios, and vi) documented responses (peer review) to climate change [
