<p class="p">Some of the readily assessable data required to populate the CCVI table was restricted to specific jurisdictions (

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], which measures the moisture deficit between the 2050 time horizon and the 1961â€“1990 baseline (ensemble GCM and medium A1B climate scenario) for the continental US [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. AET:PET values were taken from the packaged climate summaries available on the CCVI site, and produced by the Climate Wizard development team [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. For the Canadian portion of the basin, however, we had to extrapolate values to estimate approximate moisture deficit values. Approximately 53% of the basin is in Canada, and the amount of extrapolation required differs among species. Approximately 25% of the hooded warbler breeding range required extrapolated moisture change values, while close to 50% of meadow lark and wood thrush required extrapolated values (and encompassed a much greater area than the hooded warbler range). Patterns of moisture change were fairly homogenous on the US side, so we assumed that they would be equally homogenous on the Canadian side. The extrapolation was not precise and is subject to unquantifiable error, but provides an approximate estimate of how moisture conditions will change in the area.
