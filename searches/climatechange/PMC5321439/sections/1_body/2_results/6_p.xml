 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172668.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). These birds breed in mature forest that has gaps or openings where early successional vegetation grows. Within the Great Lakes, hooded warblers are found only in the basins of Lake Michigan, Lake Erie, and Lake Ontario. Hooded warblers occupy deciduous forest stands dominated by maple, American beech, and oak (

For hooded warbler all three modeling frameworks predicted northern expansion in range in relation to different climate scenarios. The Canadian CC-QBD models predicted a range expansion with an increase in habitat area by 28.6%, a northward range expansion of 34 km/decade for an overall range expansion of 378 km [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] by 2041–2070, and a further 156 km expansion by 2071–2100 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172668.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). The US CC-TABA model predicts a decrease in abundance in the southern part of the hooded warbler range and an increase in the northern US part of their range through the eastern seaboard as well as northern Minnesota, northern Wisconsin, and Michigan, including the upper peninsula [
