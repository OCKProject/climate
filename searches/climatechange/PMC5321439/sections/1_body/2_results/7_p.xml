<p class="p">For hooded warbler only, the coupled species distributionâ€”metapopulation dynamics model (CC-SDM/MPD) offered additional insights related to uncertainty based on choice of GCM and demographic parameter uncertainty. This modeling effort was applied to the entire Great Lakes Basin, so extrapolation of results across jurisdictional boundaries was not necessary. The researchers found that interpretations of vulnerability were influenced in part by the particular GCM selected for modeling climate change, but that vulnerability was also strongly affected by habitat loss. These results point to concerns with using alternative GCMs or emission scenarios to estimate temperature and to the inadequacy of using only climate based predictions and not accounting for habitat change. The overall CCVI score was less vulnerable (
