<p class="p">We focused on three climate modeling frameworks developed in the US or Canada (
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Although other modeling frameworks exist, such as the framework developed for modeling climate change effects on boreal birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], we only considered frameworks that included a substantial portion of the Great Lakes basin. The US Forest Service’s Climate Change Tree Atlas and Bird Atlas project (CC-TABA), used a multistage modeling framework that began with data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (NA-BBS) and the Forest Inventory and Analysis program [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. From this they developed SDMs for 134 tree species and 147 bird species. The avian models included output from the tree species, which was an important advantage of this modeling framework. Model extent of the tree distribution models was restricted to the US limiting the projection in the Great Lakes Basins to the US watersheds. These statistical models of habitat suitability (DISTRIB) were developed using a machine learning decision tree method (RandomForests) that included climate, elevation, and tree distribution variables. Tree distribution for 134 species was modeled using explanatory variables including climate, soil type, soil characteristics, and landscape variables to predict changes in habitat driven by changing tree distribution [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>].The reliability of current SDMs were evaluated as High (&gt;0.5), medium (0.3–0.5) and low (&lt;0.3) [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The wood thrush model had high reliability explaining 74% of the deviance, while the eastern meadowlark and hooded warbler models each medium reliability, with 49.2% and 46.6% of deviance was explained, respectively. A 1-km cell-based simulation model (SHIFT) was then used to model possible colonization of suitable new habitat cells (or patches) and the shifting front of species distribution over the next 100 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Future climate was projected using 3 downscaled GCMs (HADCM3, PCM, and GFDL) and two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (A1FI–where emissions continue to rise without mitigation and B1 –significant conservation effort) [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The DIST model estimate predicted exposure to a new climate, while a database of sensitivity and adaptability traits of tree species (MODFACS) help managers develop and assess potential actions.
