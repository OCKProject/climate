 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The Index combines information on exposure and sensitivity to produce a numerical sum, which is then converted to a categorical score (Extremely Vulnerable, Highly Vulnerable, Moderately Vulnerable, Less Vulnerable, and Insufficient Evidence) based on threshold values (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172668.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). If there is an available climate SDM then a combination of the result from the exposure/sensitivity/adaptive capacity section and modeling section is used (but with lower weighting for the modeled section). Details on the scoring mechanism are provided in [
