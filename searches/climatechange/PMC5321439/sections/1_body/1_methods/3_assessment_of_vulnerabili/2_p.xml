<p class="p">Exposure to climate stress was based on predicted magnitude of change to climatic conditions in mid-century (based on mid-level greenhouse gas scenario), and included indices of temperature and moisture severity. Exposure was estimated for the mapped breeding range of the species contained within the Great Lakes Basin, and was calculated (through GIS overlay) as the proportion of the range that falls within each of 6 moisture severity classes. To estimate moisture severity we used the Hamon AET:PET moisture metric [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], which measures the moisture deficit between the 2050 time horizon and the 1961–1990 baseline (ensemble Global Circulation Model (GCM) and medium A1B climate scenario) for the continental US [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. To estimate severity of temperature change we used data for the entire basin using an ensemble GCM, an equivalent medium greenhouse gas scenario (RCP 4.5), with difference in annual mean temperature based on the difference between the 2050 annual mean and the 1971–2000 baseline [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. To estimate severity of the exposure to climate change in the overwintering grounds we used the composite Climate Change Exposure Index (CCEI), available at the CCVI site [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. We estimated indirect exposure to climate change based on predicted impact of land use changes resulting from human responses to climate change (e.g., increased or longer haying season). The index assesses sensitivity of the species to climate change and the adaptive capacity of the species to withstand environmental change [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. For example, a species with good adaptive capacity can adjust behaviourally or genetically to climate change. The results from the indirect exposure and sensitivity/adaptive capacity sections were then weighted by the scores from the modeled response to climate change section.
