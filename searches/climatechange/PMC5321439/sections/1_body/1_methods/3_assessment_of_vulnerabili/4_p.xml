<p class="p">The Effects of Climate Change on Quebec Biodiversity project (CC-QBD) was initiated by Ouranos, a non-profit group that mediates the relationship between policy and science, and was created as a joint initiative of the Quebec government, Hydro-Quebec, and Environment Canada [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This boundary group acts as a catalyst for teamwork. The modeling framework of this group is focused on creating SDMs (they term ecological niche models) to forecast future changes in distribution and abundance of organisms (
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). SDMs are based on correlative relationships between primarily climatic variables and the North American Breeding Bird Survey [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] for bird abundance observations, or the Quebec Bird Atlas for presence/absence, but for some species environmental features also included non-climatic variables such as altitude, soil characteristics, and landcover. For bird species, the extent of the modeling area covered almost all of the Great-Lakes Basin, with only a small portion of Minnesota missing. For tree and shrub species, modeling covered the US portion of the Great Lakes Basin, with Ontario excluded and only the Quebec portion included for Canada. Rather than deriving SDMs based on a single modeling approach, this group takes an ensemble approach where they use model-averaging of the various statistical models (e.g., Generalized Additive Models, MaxEnt, and RandomForests) [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. They use this averaging approach to map shifting climate envelopes. Likewise, they use an ensemble approach to GCMs, where they averaged 70 climate change permutations using 15 global climate models and 3 projected greenhouse gas emissions scenarios (A2, A1B and B1). Mapped species distribution is averaged to provide a perspective on the shifting climate envelope that is not dependent on a single SDM or GCM. Although both bird and vegetation species were modeled, at this point the projections are not well integrated. These climate envelopes applied and averaged across scenarios predict exposure to new climates. Subsequent vulnerability assessments were supported by also considering a species’ life-history traits (using the NatureServe database) to better understand potential sensitivity and adaptability to the new climate.Current SDMs were evaluated using Area Under the Curve (AUC), where AUC scores ≥0.7 indicate good model fit. All models scored ≥0.98.
