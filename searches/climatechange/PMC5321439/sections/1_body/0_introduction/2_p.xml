<p class="p">The vulnerability of migratory songbirds, whose breeding ranges lie within the Great Lakes Basin, is an interesting example of the problem. Vulnerability assessments are conducted within a defined geographic area, and in this case the assessment area crosses an international boundary separating Canada and United States (US), and is comprised of watersheds falling within two Provinces (Ontario and Quebec) and six States (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York) (

In addition, the migratory and over-wintering ranges for some of the migratory species found within the basin overlie several countries within North America, Central America, and South America. This binational assessment area creates an interesting, and potentially problematic situation, as the area crosses multiple state, province and international boundaries and associated jurisdictional responsibilities. From a conservation perspective jurisdictional responsibility is in part a function of distribution of the species, and can be defined using a score for responsibility based on proportional distribution among jurisdictions, and a score for concern representing vulnerability and population trend [
