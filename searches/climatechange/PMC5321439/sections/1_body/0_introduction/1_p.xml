 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. CCVAs are primarily motivated by jurisdictional mandates to conserve biodiversity in the face of climate change. Although climate change is a global stressor, requiring an international effort to reduce global emissions, most conservation and management drivers are local in scope [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As a result CCVAs are often restricted to jurisdictional boundaries, and may be inadequate for species conservation where populations range across international borders and conservation strategies require international efforts [
