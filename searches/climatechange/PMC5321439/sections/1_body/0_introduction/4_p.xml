<p class="p">Several challenges to CCVAs have recently been recognized, including omission of a speciesâ€™ sensitivity and adaptive capacity, focusing on future instead of present climate change threats, and concentration on direct threats of climate change, without identifying indirect threats [

However, where the conservation concern is binational in perspective, such as the issue of migratory birds in the Great Lakes Basin, jurisdictional boundaries may further prevent adequate conservation planning because research and management efforts can become fragmented from perspectives on monitoring, analysis, modeling, and policy, and thereby create impediments to vulnerability assessment and development of conservation strategies. Although binational programs such as the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] are in place to support cooperation and knowledge exchange between nations for aquatic systems (including annexes on climate change impacts, habitat, and science), such agreements do not focus on the non-aquatic, terrestrial components of the Great Lakes basin. The importance of terrestrial systems in the basin for conserving biodiversity has been recognized by some. For example, Nature Conservancy Canada and Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry developed a Great Lakes Conservation Blueprint for Terrestrial Biodiversity [
