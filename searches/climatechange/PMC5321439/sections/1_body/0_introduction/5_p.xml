<p class="p">Approaching CCVAs from a cross-jurisdictional perspective is still relatively rare, and may be impeded by funding road-blocks, management direction, and an implicit perception that such efforts are unnecessary or only marginally important. Also, it is unlikely that organizations consider the possibility of shifting jurisdictional conservation responsibility for species at risk. The goal of this study is to explore impediments to assessing and responding to the effects of climate change on the vulnerability of birds in a binational context. We do this by testing the policy/research hypothesis that existing assessment and modeling frameworks and tools are sufficient for assessing vulnerability of migratory birds in the Great Lakes Basin of Canada and the US. We assess if sufficient and appropriate data, assessment tools, predictive models and geographic scope of these are in place to enable effective binational CCVA, including the assessment of possible shifting jurisdictional responsibility. To facilitate our evaluation we apply and assess the Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) as this assessment tool is applicable in both Canada and the US [
