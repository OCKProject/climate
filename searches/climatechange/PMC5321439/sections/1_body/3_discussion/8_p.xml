<p class="p">The focal species we selected are all within the northern periphery of their geographic ranges, where habitat amount and quality is lower than in the core of their range [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The jurisdictional responsibility for Canada is currently very low (0–1) for these species [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], but our vulnerability assessment suggests a future increase in responsibility for the Canadian Provinces, perhaps to levels 2–3 based on the priority setting tool [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Canadian Provinces should consider conservation planning for using these and other focal species to help ensure supply of future habitat conditions that are suitable for these species. This would likely involve collaboration among resource agencies (e.g., Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry, Canadian Wildlife Service, and US Fish and Wildlife Service) from both nations.
