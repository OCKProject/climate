<p class="p">We discovered several impediments to assessing the impacts of climate change on avian species and jurisdictional shifts, including border-related data gaps in climate exposure parameters, as well as modeling frameworks and a lack of examination of critical habitat factors. Despite these impediments, we were able to use the CCVI to identify that eastern meadowlark and wood thrush are highly vulnerable to climate change, but hooded warbler is less vulnerable. Our results support previous research that highlights the importance of understanding the individuality of speciesâ€™ vulnerability to climate change to appropriately inform conservation efforts [

 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Modeling frameworks that integrate critical habitat factors extend the concept of the climatic envelope into a bioclimatic envelope of necessary conditions, and consequently better define the fundamental niche. All three modeling frameworks included SDMs (or climate envelopes) and were based on current climatic correlations with current species distribution.
