<p class="p">We utilized three modeling frameworks, in conjunction with NatureServeâ€™s CCVI, to assess the whether current tools and geographic extent of data are sufficient to conduct CCVAs for migratory birds in the Great Lakes Basin. Our study indicated current modeling efforts are in some cases restricted by jurisdictional boundaries; this impedes vulnerability assessments by necessitating extrapolations to complete the CCVI. For species that are already experiencing population and habitat declines, conservation planning and research efforts should include a coordinated binational approach to ensure that conservation strategies are effective and suitable for those species that are most vulnerable to climate change.</p>
