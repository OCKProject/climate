<p class="p">Two of the modeling frameworks, CC-TABA and CC-QBD, provided online interactive mapping functions, and this greatly aided the ability to explore changes in predicted distribution and abundance. However, differences in model output, including base GCMS and categorization of predicted presence and absence made direct comparison difficult. CC-TABA provided a richer set of interactive maps overall, including predicted tree distribution, but mapping was restricted to the US portion of the basin.</p>
