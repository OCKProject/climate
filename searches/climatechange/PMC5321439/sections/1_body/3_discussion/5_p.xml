<p class="p">One of the modeling frameworks (CC-SDM/MPD) coupled a SDM to a meta-population dynamic model, and we found this particularly interesting [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This model was used to assess landscape and habitat level responses specific to hooded warbler, and thereby added a dimension of realism to the CCVA by better estimating the realized niche response. While intensive to produce, process-based models may better estimate responses to future conditions that exist outside the domain of measured current and historical responses to climate change factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. This model showed that habitat loss, as modeled by random patch removal, had a significant impact on extinction risk for this species.
