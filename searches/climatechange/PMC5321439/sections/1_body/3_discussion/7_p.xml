<p class="p">Our study revealed impediments to assessing and modeling vulnerability to climate change from a binational perspective for the whole of the Great Lakes Basin. For almost every climate exposure parameter considered there were gaps in data or modeling. In some cases models did not exist for Canada (e.g., Hamon moisture metric[

Best guess extrapolations were used where data was lacking in the Canadian watersheds. Improving ClimateWizardâ€™s packaged climate data [

Cross-border conservation efforts can be hindered by cutting model outputs at the international border. In general, we recommend increased cross-border collaboration, particularly in the Great Lakes Basin, to enhance the availability and resources needed to improve vulnerability assessments and development of conservation planning and monitoring strategies.
