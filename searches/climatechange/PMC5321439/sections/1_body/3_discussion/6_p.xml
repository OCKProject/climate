<p class="p">NatureServeâ€™s index explicitly considers factors such as climate exposure, adaptive capacity relevant to migratory birds, and modeled species distribution changes. However, the application of the CCVI required careful consideration of each factor as it may be entered in several places. For example, northern expansion of eastern meadowlark is restricted in some areas due the presence of boreal shield, which in turn is a barrier to expansion of prairie grasslands. This could be considered under dispersal and movement (of grasslands), dependence on other (grassland) species, disturbance regime (to maintain grasslands), distribution relative to natural barriers (boreal shield), and restriction to uncommon geological features or derivatives (grassland edaphic conditions). We decided this was an indirect factor (as presence of boreal shield is itself uninfluenced by climate), and that the factor was a barrier to climate-induced range expansion rather than a modifier expressing sensitivity or adaptive capacity of the species. Of the diverse group of climate related responses we discovered through our literature review for the 3 focal species, no factor was left unaddressed by the CCVI. We should note, however, that the environmental effect of climate change on the breeding grounds, phenology, and habitat can be quite different than those on the wintering grounds [
