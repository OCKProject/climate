 <xref rid="pone.0172668.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], they do not explicitly consider other critical habitat factors, such as distribution of edaphic conditions required to support habitat producing species (e.g., specific tree species such as Beech or specific ecosystem types such as tallgrass prairies). For example, the CC-TABA model provided predicted distributional information for tree habitat species, and thus contributed knowledge on the predicted future availability of critical habitat. A risk of not including the biotic habitat component is an overly optimistic view of how the species could respond to a shifting climatic regime. The three modeling frameworks we used all included biotic habitat components, but these habitat components often did not extend into the Canadian/Ontario component of the Great Lakes Basin, so generalizations or spatial extrapolations had to be made for the assessment. The SDM components for birds were always based on NA-BBS data, an easily accessible binational dataset on bird distribution, but similar data (or modeling effort) was not available for tree distribution and other biotic factors. As a result, the climate envelope and habitat envelope were not well integrated into a single bioclimatic envelope. Iverson et al. [
