<p class="p">As expected, we also found evidence of poleward shifts in abundance, which is more prominent in high latitudes where substantial warming has occurred during the study period. Our abundance-based poleward shift rate (11.0 km per decade) is similar to a previous estimated rate (10 km per decade) that is based on leading/trailing edges for forests in the eastern United States (

The fact that the longitudinal shift was 1.4 times faster than latitudinal shift suggests that vegetation dynamics are more sensitive to precipitation than to temperature, at least in a near-term time frame, because moisture availability is considered a critical factor in forest dynamics of eastern North America (

 </xref>). When considering the predominantly westward and northward shifts of tree species, it is important to understand the geographical settings of the study area, because it has hard boundaries to the east and south (that is, ocean) but soft boundaries to the west and north (that is, climate limitations). Nevertheless, abundance shifts could still be observed even if species ranges are limited by the ocean.
