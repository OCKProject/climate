<p class="p">In summary, trees in the eastern United States have experienced prominent westward and northward shifts in response to climate change and successional processes. These spatial shifts are more sensitive to the changes in moisture availability than to changes in temperature. The observed spatial shifts are associated with species that have similar functional traits and evolutionary histories. The resultant divergent spatial shifts among various groups can have significant ecological consequences and possible extinction of certain evolutionary lineages in some forest communities. Management actions to increase forest ecosystemsâ€™ resilience to climate change should consider the changes in both temperature and precipitation.</p>
