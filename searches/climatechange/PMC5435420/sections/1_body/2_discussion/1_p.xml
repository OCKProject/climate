<p class="p">Our results revealed prominent range-wide westward shifts during a short 30-year period, especially for species in low latitudes. The westward shifts are partially associated with the increased moisture availability in the western regions of the study area, coupled with decreased moisture availability in the southeastern regions. Although plants are unlikely to experience precipitation as a direct impact on physiology, they can track changes in water availability through multiple mechanisms, such as their ability to deal with drought, as shown in previous observational studies (

 </xref>). The correlation between changes in drought index and species abundance further confirms the importance of moisture availability and/or tolerance, which is also underscored by the fact that the species that shifted significantly westward are those with relatively high drought tolerance. Although the western portion of the study area has increased in moisture availability during the study period, it is still considerably drier compared to the eastern part (fig. S1). However, species with medium and high drought tolerance can take the advantage of the increased moisture availability in the relatively dry region. Future studies using finer measures of physiological traits such as embolism resistance could better address moisture-related mechanisms on species response to climate change.
