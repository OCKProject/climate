<p class="p">These trait- and phylogenetic-specific shifts can have profound implications for the resilience and sustainability of the studied forest ecosystems, because phylogenetic relatedness among species can have strong influences on community assemblage and composition (

Because some closely related species groups (both in functional traits and in evolutionary history) have different responses to the changing climate compared to other groups, the resultant differing spatial shifts among various groups can lead to the possible marked reduction of some evolutionary lineages. The reduction or replacement of certain species in a community can be consequential, because species can have substantially different effects on ecosystem structure, function, and services, and the impacts can cascade through a broad range of ecosystem processes (
