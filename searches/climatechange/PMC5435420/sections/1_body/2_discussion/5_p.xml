<p class="p">The predominantly northward shift of gymnosperm trees, along with all 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species and most 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> species, is intriguing. The mechanism for the northward shift could potentially be linked to species pollination methods because we found that most wind-pollinated species (most gymnosperms and some angiosperms) shifted northward while animal-pollinated species (most angiosperms) shifted southward. Similar northward shifts of clades were observed in the New England area during the early Holocene (between 10,000 and 8000 years ago), where 
 <italic class="italic">Picea</italic> was replaced by 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic>, followed by 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> and then 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic> species (

  <italic class="italic">37</italic>
 </xref>). However, the historical process took place over several thousand years, whereas the observed shift in this study happened in a few decades, suggesting the impacts of recent climate change, along with other nonclimatic factors (for example, land use change and forest management), on vegetation dynamics.
