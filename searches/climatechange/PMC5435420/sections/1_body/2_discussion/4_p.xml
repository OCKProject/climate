<p class="p">The observed trait- and phylogenetic-specific spatial shift in speciesâ€™ abundance is fascinating (most angiosperms shifted westward whereas most gymnosperms shifted poleward). There are several mechanisms that could explain these traits and phylogenetic-specific responses. The lack of westward shift in gymnosperms might be partially explained by the fact that gymnosperms have lower maximum growth rates than angiosperms as a result of their less efficient water transport systems (

 </xref>), making them less competitive in the western portion of the study area, which is drier than the eastern portion (fig. S1). The association between seed size and directional movement of certain species is also interesting and is potentially related to the different colonization, tolerance, and competitive strategies used by different species (

 </xref>). However, there are large variabilities in seed size among species, and seed size is embedded in a complex of many other traits that together define the life history of a tree species (

 </xref>). The association between the observed spatial shift and wood density is also an interesting one. Low wood density is often associated with fast growth, whereas high wood density is often associated with high survival (

 </xref>), which can partially explain the observed southward and westward shift of high wood density species. Because the southern region of the study area experienced droughts and the western part was relatively dry, species with high wood density might have a better chance to survive.
