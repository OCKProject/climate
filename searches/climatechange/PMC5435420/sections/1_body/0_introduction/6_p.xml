<p class="p">Here, we analyzed the distributions of 86 tree species/groups across the eastern United States over the last three decades to (i) investigate the magnitude and directionality of their responses to climate change while accounting for successional processes and (ii) provide a mechanistic understanding of the observed spatial shift. Past studies have primarily focused on the leading and trailing edges of species distributions (

  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>). We used tree abundance data to quantify species response to climate change because quantitative changes within species ranges are more informative (
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">6</italic>
 </xref>), can be considerable without any observable changes in overall range extent (
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">28</italic>
 </xref>), and are likely to represent intermediate states in species range shifts (
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">14</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">29</italic>
 </xref>). We hypothesized that (i) young trees have more prominent responses to climate change than adult trees and (ii) species that experience similar responses to climate change share similar physiological traits and evolutionary histories.
