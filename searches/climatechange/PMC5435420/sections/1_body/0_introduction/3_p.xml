 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">18</italic>
 </xref>). These different patterns were likely driven by trait dissimilarities among species. For example, gymnosperms generally have slower juvenile maximum growth rate than angiosperms (
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">19</italic>
 </xref>), nearly all gymnosperms are wind-pollinated whereas many angiosperms are insect-pollinated, and gymnosperms have greater hydraulic safety margins than angiosperms in response to drought (
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">11</italic>
 </xref>). Tremendous variability also exists within the gymnosperm and angiosperm tree lineages in response to different environmental conditions because of their varying functional traits (
