<p class="p">The impacts of climate change on trees can be complicated, as different combinations of alterations in temperature and precipitation can result in different impacts (

  <italic class="italic">15</italic>
 </xref>) and different tree species can have different responses to climate change (

  <italic class="italic">25</italic>
 </xref>). To complicate things further, species range shift can also be affected by other nonclimatic factors. In particular, successional processes, influenced by various types of disturbances (or lack of disturbances) along with land use changes, could play an important role in species recruitment, dispersal, and abundance change (
