<p class="p">We also observed regional differences in species abundance shifts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The majority of species (85%) centered in the warm continental Northern Hardwood region shifted their abundance poleward at a median rate of 20.1 km per decade. Species centered in the hot continental Central Hardwood region shifted primarily westward (83%) at a median rate of 18.9 km per decade. Similarly, species centered in the subtropical Southern Pine-Hardwood region also had a primarily westward shift (77%) at a median rate of 24.7 km per decade. Species centered in the Forest-Prairie Transition region had a westward shift at a median rate of 30.0 km per decade.
