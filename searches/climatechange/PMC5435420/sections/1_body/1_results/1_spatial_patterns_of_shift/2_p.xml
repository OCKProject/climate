<p class="p">Further examination of tree abundances within the four cardinal quadrants of each species distribution range indicates that the observed spatial shifts are primarily due to changes in subpopulations at the leading edges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). In general, subpopulations in the northwestern quadrant had the highest rate of poleward and westward shifts (median, 6.9 and 15.7 km per decade, respectively) compared to subpopulations in other quadrants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>, A and B). Moreover, the northwestern subpopulations within each species range had the highest increase in stem density (median, 24%), whereas other subpopulations had low increases (5.6 and 8.1% in the northeastern and southwestern quadrants, respectively) or were nearly flat (0.6% in the southeastern quadrant) (
