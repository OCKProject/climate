<p class="p">We observed a prominent westward and poleward shift in abundance for most tree species in the eastern United States during the last 30 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Of the 86 species studied, 73% shifted their abundance centers westward, of which 65% were statistically significant (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), whereas 62% shifted poleward, of which 55% were significant (table S1A). The median longitudinal rate for species that shifted westward (15.4 km per decade) was 40% larger than the median latitudinal rate for species that shifted poleward (11.0 km per decade). The primary direction of species abundance shift was northwest (37% of the species), and the least common direction was southeast (2%).
