<p class="p">Sapling-sized trees had a slightly higher proportion but longer distance in westward and poleward shifts than adults (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>, B and C, and table S1A). About 71% of tree species shifted their sapling abundance westward versus 70% for adult trees (61 and 65% were significant, respectively, at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Similarly, 59% of species shifted their sapling abundance poleward versus 56% for adults (57 and 58% were significant, respectively, at 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The median westward and poleward shift distances for saplings (20.7 and 13.1 km per decade, respectively) were longer than those for adults (15.6 and 12.5 km per decade, respectively; table S1A). A paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test demonstrated that the westward shift distances for sapling and adult tree abundance were statistically different (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.063).
