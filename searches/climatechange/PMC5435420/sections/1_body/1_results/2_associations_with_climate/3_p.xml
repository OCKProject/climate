<p class="p">Forest successional processes, as approximated by stem density and basal area of all overstory trees, also had influences on the observed species abundance shift. Changes in species abundance were positively related to the changes in overall stem density but negatively related to the changes in total basal area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5C</xref> and fig. S2C), indicating that forests in relatively early successional stages (that is, rapid increases in density but low accumulations in basal area) had more gains in abundance of the studied species than forests in late successional stages. A multiple regression analysis further confirmed that changes in TAP and total stem density were positively associated with changes in species abundance (table S2).
