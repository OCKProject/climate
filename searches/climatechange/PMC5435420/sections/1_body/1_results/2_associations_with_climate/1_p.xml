 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref>). With some exceptions, species located in higher temperature and precipitation climatic space experienced reductions in abundance, as indicated by the speciesâ€™ density change. On the other hand, species located in the lower temperature and precipitation climatic space experienced increases (
