<p class="p">Changes in species abundance had a stronger association with moisture (precipitation and drought index) than with temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref> and fig. S2). Changes in TAP were positively associated with changes in species abundance, explaining about 19% of the variability in abundance change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5B</xref>). The majority of species (80%) that experienced an increase in TAP over 40 mm in their distribution ranges underwent an increase in abundance, and all species increased in abundance when precipitation increased over 60 mm. Not surprisingly, changes in drought condition (PDSI) were also positively associated with species abundance changes (
