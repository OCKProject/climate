<p class="p">The observed spatial shifts in species abundance are associated with certain functional traits that are related to physiological tolerance and dispersal ability. In general, species that shifted westward had a larger seed size (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.012) and higher wood density (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.039) than species that shifted eastward. For species that shifted significantly eastward and westward, the median value for seed weight is 0.007 and 0.069 g per seed, and the median value for wood density is 0.47 and 0.51 g/cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, respectively (fig. S3). In addition, species with different degrees of drought tolerance had different westward shift rates, where species with low drought tolerance had the lowest westward shift rate (median rate, 2.6 km per decade) compared to the medium and high drought tolerance groups (median rate, 14.3 and 11.6 km per decade, respectively) (fig. S4).
