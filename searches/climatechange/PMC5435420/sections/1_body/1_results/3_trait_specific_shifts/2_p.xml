<p class="p">On the other hand, species that shifted northward had a lower maximum annual precipitation (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.055) than species that shifted southward (primarily southwest). The median maximum annual precipitation is 1524 and 2032 mm/year, and the median wood density is 0.49 and 0.56 g/cm

In addition, wind-pollinated species primarily shifted northward, whereas animal-pollinated species shifted southward (fig. S6). All other investigated traits (see details in table S3) are not significantly associated with the observed shifts (

 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.085).
