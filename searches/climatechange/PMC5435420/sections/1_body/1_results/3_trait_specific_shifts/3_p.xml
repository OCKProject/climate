<p class="p">We also detected a small but statistically significant phylogenetic signal of longitudinal shifts in species abundance (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 0.023, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.004), but no such signal for latitudinal shifts (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 0.007, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.760). In other words, members of some evolutionary groups exhibit relatively consistent westward or eastward shifts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). Fifty-three of the 65 angiosperm species (81.5%) shifted westward, 34 (52.3%) of which significantly shifted, whereas 10 of the 21 gymnosperm species shifted westward. At a finer evolutionary resolution, all 13 red oak species (section 
 <italic class="italic">Lobatae</italic>) had westward movement, with 53.8% (7 species) being statistically significant, whereas 3 of the 9 white oaks (section 
 <italic class="italic">Quercus</italic>) moved east. Meanwhile, all the members of the Fabaceae, Juglandaceae, and Lauraceae, and most members of the Sapindaceae, moved westward. At the same time, three of the four 
 <italic class="italic">Betula</italic> species moved eastward. No clear patterns were observed for the latitudinal shifts among the angiosperms (38 species shifted poleward and 27 shifted southward), whereas the majority of gymnosperms (15 species, or 71.4%) shifted poleward (fig. S7).
