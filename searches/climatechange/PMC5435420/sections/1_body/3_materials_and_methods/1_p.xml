<p class="p">We obtained tree abundance data from the U.S. Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program from two different inventory periods (Supplementary Text). FIA provides a long-term data set of forest conditions across all forest land in the United States, which has been used to study regional spatial and temporal forest dynamics (

 </xref>). The first inventory (T1) included in this study was between 1980 and 1995 and varied by state. The second inventory (T2) was the latest completed inventory, which was finished in 2015 for most states. The time period between the two intervals ranged from 20 to 35 years, with an average of 29.5 years (table S4).
