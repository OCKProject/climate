<p class="p">To test whether the observed spatial shifts are trait-specific, we first constructed a database with two functional trait groups (table S3). The first group encompassed traits associated with trees’ ability to migrate, including seed weight, dispersal mechanism, and rate of spread. The second group encompassed traits associated with trees’ physiological tolerances, including temperature, precipitation, fire, shade, and drought tolerances. Because of the lack of actual precipitation and temperature tolerance data, we used minimum temperature, minimum precipitation, and maximum precipitation from species-specific realized climatic niche as surrogates in our study (see table S3 for variable definition and data sources). We compared species traits among four classes: significant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant westward or northward shift, nonsignificant east or southward shift, and significant eastward or southward shift. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used for traits with continuous variables, and a χ
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> test was used for traits with categorical variables due to the non-normality of the data. Additionally, a Kruskal-Wallis test for differences in latitudinal and longitudinal shift rates was used for categorical plant traits.
