<p class="p">To investigate how species abundances shifted between the two inventories, we used the shift distance and direction of the geographic center weighted by species abundance (Supplementary Text). We conducted a total of 10,000 random permutations per species to test whether the observed shift was statistically significant (Supplementary Text). Rose diagrams were generated in the R circular package (

 </xref>) to illustrate the overall pattern of abundance shift of both direction and distance for all species studied. To understand whether the observed spatial shift is due to the changes in leading or trailing edges, we first subdivided each species distribution range into four cardinal quadrants on the basis of its abundance center at T1. We then calculated and compared the shift distances and density changes for subpopulations within each quadrant. To avoid sampling biases, only species with sufficient sample sizes (≥30 hexagons and ≥300 plots) at either T1 or T2 for each subpopulation were included in this analysis. A Tukey post hoc test was applied to test whether the shifts among subpopulations in each quadrant were statistically different.
