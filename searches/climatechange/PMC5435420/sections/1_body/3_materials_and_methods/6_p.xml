<p class="p">We investigated the degree to which longitudinal and latitudinal shifts were associated with the evolutionary relatedness of tree species by displaying these shifts on a phylogenetic supertree encompassing the 86 species in the study and by testing for phylogenetic signal in these shifts. The phylogenetic supertree was pruned from one generated for 397 native tree species occurring throughout the forests of the contiguous 48 states and inventoried by FIA, as described by Potter and Woodall (
 <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">47</italic>
 </xref>). We used the R package phytools (
 <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">48</italic>
 </xref>) to display each speciesâ€™ longitudinal and latitudinal shifts (across all life stages) on the phylogenetic tree, with trees in the aforementioned four classes. We then used the R package picante (
 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">49</italic>
 </xref>) to test the degree to which the tree species phylogeny predicts the ecological similarity of the species with respect to these shifts. Specifically, we generated the 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> statistic, which compares the observed phylogenetic signal in a trait (in this case, the longitudinal or latitudinal shift) to the signal under a Brownian motion model of trait evolution on a phylogeny (
 <xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">50</italic>
 </xref>), and then assessed the statistical significance of the phylogenetic signal by comparing observed patterns of the variance of independent contrasts of each trait to a null model of shuffled taxon labels across the tips of the phylogeny.
