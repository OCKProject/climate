<p class="p">Across the study area, a total of 201 species/groups were recorded during T1, and 240 were recorded during T2. To account for the variations of sampling protocols between the two inventory periods, we first applied a set of selection criteria (Supplementary Text), which resulted in a total of 86 species/groups in our analysis (table S5). Because a significant portion of the plots were measured during only one of the two inventory periods, we aggregated plot-level abundance data to the hexagon level (a spatial tessellation design used by FIA). A total of 2747 hexagons of 1452 km

Total number of stems in a hexagon (stems/ha Ã— total forested area) was used to measure species abundance within each hexagon for saplings [defined as &lt;12.7 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh)] (
