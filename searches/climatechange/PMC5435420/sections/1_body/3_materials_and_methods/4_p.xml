<p class="p">We then analyzed the relationship between the observed species shifts in relation to climate variables and forest succession status. For climate variables, we first calculated MAT, TAP, and mean PDSI in the recent past (1951–1980) and during the study period (1981–2015). MAT and TAP were calculated using the 4-km spatial resolution climate data from the PRISM Climate Group (

These climate variables were then aggregated at the hexagon level for each period. We used stem density and basal area for all trees regardless of species as indicators of successional status at T1 and T2 for each hexagon. In general, overall stem density decreases whereas basal area increases as forest progresses from early to late successional stages. Next, we calculated relative changes in mean stem density between the two inventories by species, and we calculated relative changes between T1 and T2 in total stem density and basal area for all trees and changes over time in mean MAT, TAP, and PDSI within each species’ overlapped distribution range at T1 and T2 (that is, only with hexagons that contain the target species at both T1 and T2). A multiple linear regression with a mixed-effects model was performed to test the association among changes in species-level mean stem density and changes in MAT, TAP, PDSI, total stem density, and total basal area.
