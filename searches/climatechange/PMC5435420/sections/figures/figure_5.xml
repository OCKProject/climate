   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) Relative changes in species density [(Density_T2 − Density_T1)/Density_T1 × 100)] in association with species MAT and TAP at T1 within the overlapped species distribution range at T1 and T2. Dot size is proportional to the relative density change. Red and green represent negative and positive change in the relative density, respectively. (

   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) Positive association between relative changes in species density and changes in total tree stem density.
