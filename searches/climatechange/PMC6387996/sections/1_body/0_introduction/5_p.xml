<p class="p">The overall goal of this study was to assess the influence of increased temperature and increased salinity as co-occurring stressors on the physiological performance of three SFE fishes: Delta Smelt, Mississippi Silversides, and Largemouth Bass. Here, we determined (1) species-specific tolerance to elevated salinity and temperature, (2) characterized if the sequence in which stressors were experienced (e.g. initial warming, subsequent increased salinity, and vice-versa) affected the upper temperature tolerance (i.e. critical thermal maximum) of fishes and (3) estimated regional differences in the sensitivity of these species to climate change. To determine whether the initial thermal or salinity exposure affected general physiological condition and osmoregulation under a multiple stressor challenge we quantified changes in body condition, hematology, tissue water content and plasma osmolality. We hypothesized native and non-native species would differ in their physiological sensitivity to elevated temperature and salinity. Specifically, we predicted that Delta Smelt would be most severely affected by stressors because of their physiological sensitivity (e.g. lowered tolerance and decreased osmoregulation capacity) and will be most susceptible to extinction under projected climate change. In contrast, we predicted that Mississippi Silversides would be less sensitive to multiple stressors, and Largemouth Bass to be less sensitive to increased temperature but more sensitive to salinity increases than either Silversides or Delta Smelt. Because the SFE is dynamic with respect to temperature, we think specific habitat areas will promote differential geographic vulnerability of each species (determined by relative thermal safety margins). This is important to explore given that specific regions are proposed ‘strongholds’ for Delta Smelt and targets of considerable restoration efforts in the future. Therefore, continued climate change and periodic droughts may favor non-native species persistence in the SFE ecosystem while native fishes continue to decline.</p>
