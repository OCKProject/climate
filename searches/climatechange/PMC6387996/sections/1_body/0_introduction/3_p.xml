<p class="p">One fish of particular concern in the SFE is the Delta Smelt (
 <italic class="italic">Hypomesus transpacificus</italic>). Delta Smelt are a pelagic, semi-andaromous, annual Osmerid endemic to the SFE. While once abundant in the system, the population has declined to critically low levels despite conservation efforts and listing under both state and federal Endangered Species Acts (

Several studies have described the physiological sensitivity of different life stages of Delta Smelt to increased temperatures or salinities of 18–20°C and 4–10 ppt (as single stressors;

 <xref rid="coy076C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>); however, no study has investigated the interaction of elevated temperature and salinity together on physiological performance of Delta Smelt. Warming has been shown to increase physiological costs of Delta Smelt through increased metabolic rates and upregulation of genes associated with cellular stress response mechanisms (

Increased energetic demands to cope with warming may reduce energy available to cope with a secondary co-occurring stressor such as salinity, leading to potential trade-offs in energy allocation that could impact processes such as osmoregulation. Therefore, projected global climate change conditions (i.e. elevations in both temperature and salinity) may have direct effects on physiological and fitness parameters (i.e. energy allocation, growth, reproduction) of Delta Smelt and substantially affect extinction risk (
