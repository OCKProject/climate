<p class="p">Changes in water temperature and salinity can have profound influences on fish physiology (

 <xref rid="coy076C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Farrell, 2011</xref>). SFE fishes are often exposed to temperatures and salinities outside of their optimal performance range (
 <xref rid="coy076C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>), and these deviations may result in increased energetic costs due to alterations in cellular physiology, damage to macromolecules, or recruitment of stress response mechanisms (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="coy076C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sokolova, 2013</xref>). For example, high water temperature can affect the biochemistry and physiology of fishes by disrupting macromolecular structures as well as altering rates of metabolic processes (

 <xref rid="coy076C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fangue 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>). Elevated temperature has also been shown to impact osmoregulatory capacity (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="coy076C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>), and elevated salinity can cause osmoregulatory imbalance and activate the whole-organism stress response (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1989
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="coy076C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McCormick, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="coy076C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hasenbein 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>). The combined effects of multiple stressors of elevated temperature and salinity may create competing energetic demands that could affect reproductive fitness and survival. This is particularly relevant for SFE species that have life-history stages that move to different areas of the system, with different temperature and salinity profiles, during ontogeny such as anadromous salmonids or the semi-anadromous Delta Smelt.
