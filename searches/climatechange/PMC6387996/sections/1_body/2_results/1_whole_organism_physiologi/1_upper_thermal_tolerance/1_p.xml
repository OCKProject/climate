<p class="p">Each species showed similar responses in upper thermal tolerance to experimental stressor regimes across acclimation time such that elevated temperature increased CTMax and elevated salinity had little to no effect, depending on species (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>). CTMax of Delta Smelt was significantly affected by stressor regimes (

 <sub class="sub">23,21</sub> = 107.98, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001); however, the effect of stressor regime was dependent on acclimation time (

 <sub class="sub">9,321</sub> = 8.69, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) indicated by a significant interaction (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">9,321</sub> = 4.84, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) between the two factors. There was no effect of fish size (length, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,321</sub> = 1.35, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.25) on CTMax of Delta Smelt within the length ranging from 25.3 to 54.5 mm. Acclimation to elevated temperature increased CTMax (see Days 9–16 in Warm/Sal, and 18–25 in Sal/Warm), but salinity had no effect on CTMax (see Tukey results in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>a). Mississippi Silverside CTMax showed a significant interaction (

 <sub class="sub">18,309</sub> = 15.12,

 <sub class="sub">2,309</sub> = 253.42, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) and acclimation time (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">9,309</sub> = 7.02, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), as well as an effect of fish size (standard length, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,309</sub> = 4.64, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.03). Larger Silversides had slightly higher CTMax compared to smaller Silversides. Post-hoc Tukey results indicated temperature not salinity was responsible for the increased CTMax (see values in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>b). After 7 days of exposure to an initial increase in temperature (Warm/Sal), CTMax of Silversides increased by ~1.5°C (Tukey, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), and remained stable under the subsequent salinity exposure (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). The initial salinity exposure (Sal/Warm) had no effect on Silverside CTMax; however, with the subsequent exposure to increased temperature CTMax increased to match the peak CTMax of fish exposed to increased temperature in the Warm/Sal regime. Largemouth Bass CTMax was also significantly affected by stressor regimes (

 <sub class="sub">2,320</sub> = 141.50,

 <sub class="sub">9,320</sub> = 54.34, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), with a significant interaction (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">18,320</sub> = 7.52, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) between regime and time. There was with no effect of size of Largemouth Bass on CTMax (length, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,320</sub> = 0.002, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.96, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>c). In contrast to Smelt and Silversides, increased salinity and temperature interacted in an additive fashion to increase CTMax in Largemouth Bass, such that after the multiple stressor exposure the increase in CTMax was a sum of the initial (after Day 16) and subsequent temperature and salinity exposures (after Day 25) (~2.6°C total, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>c).
