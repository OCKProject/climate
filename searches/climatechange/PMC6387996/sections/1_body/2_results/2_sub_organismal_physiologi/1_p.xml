<p class="p">Mean values of hematocrit, osmolality and muscle tissue water content across each exposure period are given in Table 
 <xref rid="coy076TB2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> for Delta Smelt, Mississippi Silversides, and Largemouth Bass. Delta Smelt hematocrit was altered by stressor regime (F
 <sub class="sub">2,183</sub> = 4.487, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.012), independent of acclimation time (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">9,183</sub> = 1.77, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.076) with no interaction between regime and time (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">18,183</sub> = 0.758, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.747). Overall, Delta Smelt in Warm/Sal had greater hematocrit at 44 ± 1 (mean ± SE across all time points; lsmeans Tukey, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) compared to 40 ± 1 in the control or 42 ± 1 in Sal/Warm. Tissue water content was altered by stressor regime (

 <sub class="sub">2,183</sub> = 4.719,

 <sub class="sub">18,183</sub> = 0.680, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.829). Overall, tissue water content (mean ± SE across time points) of Delta Smelt in Warm/Sal was 0.7 ± 0.2% lower than control fish (lsmeans Tukey, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), but tissue water content of fish in Sal/Warm was similar to control fish (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &gt; 0.05). In general, tissue water content of Delta Smelt did increase over acclimation time from 78.5 ± 0.3 (mean ± SE across all stressor regimes) at 7 days to 79.9 ± 0.3 after 25 days.
