<p class="p">Hematocrit (% red blood cells/total volume) was measured to determine if hematological alterations occurred to support increased blood oxygen carrying capacity. Blood was collected from the caudal vasculature of euthanized fish with a heparinized micro-hematocrit capillary tube (60 mm calibrated tip, 0.5 mm inner diameter [ID] for Smelt and Silversides and 70 mm calibrated tip, 1 mm ID for Bass). Tubes were rapidly sealed with a putty compound and spun on a micro-hematocrit centrifuge for 3 min to separate the red blood cells from the plasma. Percent hematocrit was read in duplicate and recorded.</p>
