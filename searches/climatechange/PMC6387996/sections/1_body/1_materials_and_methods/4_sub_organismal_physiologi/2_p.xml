<p class="p">Plasma was collected by scoring the hematocrit tube with a file, separating the plasma from the red blood cells. Plasma was then pipetted into a micro-centrifuge tube, frozen on dry ice and stored at –80°C until analysis. Plasma osmolality (mOsm kg
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) was quantified to assess osmotic imbalances that might have occurred in response to thermal and osmotic experimental stressor regimes. For Delta Smelt and Mississippi Silversides osmolality was measured in 2 μl plasma samples using a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro 5600, Wescor Biomedical Systems, Logan, UT, USA). Due to the small amount of blood and plasma collected for Smelt and Silversides, when possible individual samples were analyzed. If individual volume was insufficient, samples were pooled for the respective replicate tank (

Osmolality was measured after 7 days (baseline), 9 and 16 (0 and 7 days after the initial exposure), and 18 and 25 days (0 and 7 days following the subsequent multiple stressor) to evaluate acute and short-term osmoregulatory changes.
