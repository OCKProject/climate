<p class="p">Juvenile Mississippi Silversides (
 <italic class="italic">Menidia beryllina</italic>) were obtained from Aquatic BioSystems (Fort Collins, CO, USA) in July 2016 at 135 days post hatch (dph). Silversides were immediately separated into nine 400 l tanks upon arrival (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 90–96/tank), acclimated to 16°C and 2.4 ppt for 2 weeks before the experimental regimes (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3 tank replicates/regime) began at ~150 dph. Juvenile Delta Smelt (
 <italic class="italic">Hypomesus transpacificus</italic>) were spawned and reared at the University of California Davis—Fish Culture and Conservation Laboratory (FCCL) in Byron, CA using optimal culture conditions (16°C, 0.4 ppt [
 <xref rid="coy076C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lindberg 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2013
 </xref>]). Smelt were transported in September 2016 at ~135 dph, separated into nine 400 l tanks (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 90–99/tank with 3 tank replicates/stressor regime), and acclimated to 16°C and 2.4 ppt for one week until the experiment began at ~145 dph. Silversides and Smelt were fed 3% body weight (g) per day with a mix of Hikari Plankton (25%; semi-float), and BioVita starter (50% of #0 crumble and 25% #1 crumble). Largemouth Bass (
 <italic class="italic">Micropterus salmoides</italic>) juveniles were transported from a commercial aquaculture facility (The Fishery Inc., Galt, CA, USA) at ~7 months of age in late October 2016. Bass were immediately split into nine 682 l tanks (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 60–75 per tank with 3 tank replicates per regime) upon arrival, and acclimated at 16°C and 2.4 ppt for 4 weeks until the experiment began. Bass were fed a pellet diet (Skretting, Tooele, UT, USA), twice daily, at 1% body weight per day. Feeding rations for each species remained the same from acclimation through experimental stressor testing.
