<p class="p">Each experimental stressor regime was conducted in a separate recirculating system comprised of three replicate tanks to allow for the manipulation of temperature and salinity conditions independently between regimes. Each of the 3 systems had a separate heat pump in which temperature was initially set at 16°C. Salinity treatments of 2.4 ppt were maintained by mixing synthetic sea salt in an external 757 l mixing drum (one for each treatment) plumbed into each system sump. A water change was completed daily by introducing a new 757 l drum of fresh treatment water to the sump. Temperature and salinity increases (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F2" class="xref">2</xref>) were conducted over a 2-day period (single [Days 7–9] and multiple stressors [Days 16–18]) by increasing temperature from 16 to 20°C at 1°C per 12 h, and increasing salinity from 2.4 to 12 ppt at 2.4 ppt per 12 h by pre-dissolving sea salt in a series of buckets and adding the brine directly to the system sumps. Largemouth Bass salinity treatments were increased 1.4 ppt per 12 h until 8 ppt. Both temperature and salinity changes were homogenous in each replicate tank after 1 h. Temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen were measured in each tank and system sump daily using a handheld YSI meter (YSI 85, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) and presented in Table
