<p class="p">TSMs were calculated for a habitat temperature of 20°C, simulating the current study’s experimental temperature stressor regime. A habitat temperature of 20°C is also close to the mean temperature of 18.9°C where many early life stages of Delta Smelt were historically caught in field surveys in summer and fall, seasons when temperature stress is most likely to occur (

 </xref>), and current high temperatures in the South Delta region may become estuarine-wide by the year 2100. Therefore, South Delta TSMs provide a good estimate of what TSMs may be across all habitat regions with warming.
