 <xref rid="coy076C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lenth, 2016</xref>), and an alpha value set at 0.05. All datasets were first visually inspected for assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances using figures of Q-Q plots and residuals vs. fitted values and frequency, as well as residuals versus fixed factors of species, experimental stressor regimes, acclimation time, and replicate tanks. Data were log transformed when needed and analyzed using linear regressions (LR) and linear models (LMs). Model summary tables were generated using 
 <italic class="italic">Anova</italic> function, and post-hoc Tukey comparisons were conducted using the 
 <italic class="italic">lsmeans</italic> to determine differential responses by stressor regime across acclimation time, as well as between each regime at a given time. LMs were conducted for each species separately since Largemouth Bass had different salinity exposure values (8 ppt) compared to Delta Smelt and Silversides (12 ppt). Since each sampling time point was an independent subset of fish, LRs were conducted to assess the impacts of stressor regimes and acclimation time on several related growth metrics including wet mass, standard length and calculated body condition factor. A univariate LM was conducted for CTMax with stressor regime and acclimation time as predictors and fish size as a covariate in the model. Since the elevated temperature exposure was comparable across all species for the initial stressor period (Warm/Sal), a LM was conducted to determine if CTMax under control conditions (Day 7) and after a week of increased temperature (Day 16) differed by species. A separate univariate LM was conducted for each sub-organismal metric (hematocrit, % tissue water, and osmolality [for LMB only]) due to missing values and uneven sample sizes. Only fish sampled for physiological metrics were included in the body condition factor measures (including wet mass and length) as CTMax procedures may have altered mass and body condition.
