<p class="p">Lastly, species differences in ecological thermal safety margins (TSM) were tested with an LM with species and SFE region as fixed factors and the calculated TSM. TSM values included in the model were pooled from experimental Days 11, 13 and 16 from species acclimated to 20Â°C since CTMax were not statistically different,
