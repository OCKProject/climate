Each species was given 30 min in individual CTMax chambers with their respective experimental regime water conditions before the CTMax trial began. Water temperature was raised 0.3°C min

Once fish demonstrated LOE, temperature was recorded with a calibrated immersion thermometer (to 0.1°C), and fish were immediately removed from the chamber and placed in individually labeled recovery tanks (9.5 l or 18.9 l) at the fish’s specific regime conditions (i.e. if fish came from a 12 ppt or 20°C exposure, they recovered in those conditions). Only fish that survived 24 h following the CTMax trial were included in the dataset. Smelt and Silversides were measured in 1.5 l chambers that were painted black to reduce potential visual stress. Chambers were then placed in a 115 l water-bath at the appropriate acclimation temperature (16 or 20°C) and temperatures were ramped using two 800-Watt submersible heaters and water pumps for even heating of water. Six consecutive CTMax trials with 6 chambers each were conducted on each day for Silversides and Delta Smelt. Largemouth Bass were measured individually in 18 l aquarium tanks affixed with an acrylic lid, 4 of these tanks were placed into two larger water baths for 8 individuals per trial and 5 total CTMax trials on each day. Each of these water baths contained an 1800 W heater, two 500 W heaters and had two water pumps for even heating and circulation of water. Treatments and tank replicates were randomized throughout the day for all species. All CTMax chambers contained an air-stone to ensure that O
