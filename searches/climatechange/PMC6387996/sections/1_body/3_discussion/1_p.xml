<p class="p">This study highlights comparative physiological responses of native and non-native fish species to multiple stressors resulting from predicted climate change and associated weather extremes, particularly drought and extreme heat in an estuary. Specifically, this study provides evidence that an initial sub-lethal stressor of elevated temperature or elevated salinity does not compromise the ability to cope with the addition of a secondary heterologous stressor (multiple stressor scenario) in three species of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). Here, both native and non-native species increased their upper thermal tolerance following acclimation to high temperature, independent of elevations in salinity. In contrast, exposure to elevated salinity increased upper thermal tolerance only in Largemouth Bass. Thermal safety margins of 20Â°C-acclimated fish were greatest in non-native species compared to native Delta Smelt, and indicated that Smelt are a species currently occupying habitats approaching their upper temperature tolerance limits.</p>
