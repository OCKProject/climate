<p class="p">Although Delta Smelt and Silversides had faster rates of acquiring upper thermal tolerance, it is possible that both species could have acquired additional upper thermal tolerance if acclimation temperatures were higher (like Largemouth Bass,

 </xref>). No other studies have assessed the capacity of Delta Smelt to acquire thermal tolerance when acclimated to temperatures above 20°C. Juvenile Delta Smelt acclimated to a continuous increase in temperature at 1°C per day showed a chronic lethal maximum temperature (i.e. the temperature at which 50% mortality of fish is observed) of 27–28°C (

For example, if smelt were acclimated to 22 or 24°C for 2 weeks could they further increase their upper thermal limits or have they in fact reached their ultimate thermal limit. It is of note that the present study recorded some of the highest acute upper temperature tolerance limits for juvenile Delta Smelt after warm acclimation with a mean CTMax of 29.7°C ± 0.2 (mean ± SE). Twenty-five percent (36 individuals of 144) of Delta Smelt actually reached 30.0–30.7°C until sudden loss of equilibrium. Together, our findings suggest that juvenile Delta Smelt may indeed have more plasticity in upper tolerance limits than previously described (
