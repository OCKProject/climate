<p class="p">All species were able to acquire additional upper temperature tolerance with 7 days of exposure to +4°C above control temperature (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>); however, species-specific plasticity in thermal tolerance was evident. Delta Smelt increased CTMax by ~1.2°C, whereas non-native species increased thermal tolerance by ~1.5 to 2°C (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>). Plasticity in upper thermal tolerance is common in fishes and known to be modulated by warm acclimation, including for Delta Smelt (

 <xref rid="coy076C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Beitinger &amp; Bennett, 2000</xref>). Based on previous findings, Largemouth Bass have been shown to acquire greater upper temperature tolerance if acclimated to temperatures above 20°C (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1998
 </xref>). In contrast to warming, exposure to increased salinity did not increase upper temperature tolerance limits in prey species (Delta Smelt and Silversides, Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>a,b). Similarly, acute salinity exposures of 2, 6, 18 and 34 ppt have previously been shown to have no effect on CTMax in adult Delta Smelt (
 <xref rid="coy076C39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Komoroske 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Largemouth Bass, were differentially affected by increased temperature and salinity compared to Silversides and Delta Smelt. Bass CTMax was increased by exposure to increased salinity, but it is of note that Bass were tested at 8 ppt and not 12 ppt as the prey species. It is unclear if the two-step increase in CTMax of Largemouth Bass (seen in Warm/Sal and Sal/Warm regimes) was the result of an interactive additive effect of elevated temperature and salinity (e.g. sum of single effects of salinity and temperature), or alternatively, if Bass’ CTMax increased in the multiple-stressor period because the fish were still acclimating to warm temperatures, independent of salinity (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>c). Overall, the sequential elevation in temperature and salinity (or salinity followed by temperature) did not negatively compromise upper thermal tolerance in any of the SFE species tested. The rate of acquired temperature tolerance varied among species. For example, Delta Smelt and Silversides rapidly reached a new baseline for upper thermal tolerance 2–4 days following the elevated temperature exposure, whereas Bass upper temperature tolerance had not stabilized after 7 days, demonstrating that acclimation to warming takes longer in Largemouth Bass than the prey species in this study (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="coy076F3" class="xref">3</xref>).
