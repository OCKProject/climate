  <p class="p">Experimental design, on a scale of days, for initial and subsequent exposures to multiple stressors. Each timeline represents experimental stressor regimes including (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Control conditions, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Warm/Sal, an initial thermal stressor (T
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>) followed by a subsequent salinity increase (T
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>:S
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>), and (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Sal/Warm, an initial salinity exposure (S
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>) followed by a subsequent temperature increased (S
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>:T
   <sub class="sub">High</sub>). Physiological assessments were made across time (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) after each change in exposures to assess responses over time. *Largemouth Bass high salinity exposure was 8 ppt, whereas Delta Smelt and Silversides exposure were 12 ppt.
