<p id="p0105" class="p">With the exception of non-M.D. medical academics, air pollution was the most frequently mentioned health concern across all professional categories (see 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="graphic" class="xref">Exhibit 5</xref>). Though air pollution is a serious concern, predicted impact on health and morbidity is small when compared to that of infectious disease, extreme weather, or food security in the US. The USâ€™ temperate climate and larger urban population exacerbate the risk of these phenomena (

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burke, 2016</xref>) In fact, deaths related to respiratory disease are perhaps more likely to occur due to rising ambient air temperature than through particulate matter from air pollution (
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Patz et al., 2005</xref>), especially if urbanization continues apace. Therefore, we suggest that air pollution receives inflated concern in light of other, more complex and epidemiologically significant consequences of climate change. We are concerned that this again betrays significant misunderstanding of the threats climate change pose to US health care and society more generally. Four authors within this review shared this concern, outlining worrisome lack of knowledge, information, or expertise regarding climate change in the medical community (

 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maibach et al., 2008</xref>). Because American culture views the medical community as trusted professionals, these systemic misunderstandings threaten to negatively impact awareness and action. We believe that further research is necessary to substantiate this idea and recommend concrete proposals, such as systemic modifications, patient education and climate-focused CME training.
