<p id="p0110" class="p">The strategies authors most readily supported tended to be future-oriented, with advocacy (78%) and education (92%) strategies most popular among the articles. Public advocacy certainly positions a health care entity to support efforts that address climate change, but ultimately outsources the need to act. We realize that it is beyond the scope of organizations to care about all issues at all times, but health care has an unimpeachable empirical, ethical and fiscal stake in climate change. There was a strong emphasis on education, too, reflecting the demonstrable value in developing research proposals to gather more data (

 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sarfaty et al., 2014</xref>). The immediacy of climate change requires a strong response to current practice. Care providers right now need to be equipped with the tools to address health impacts of climate change when it presents in the clinic (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bedsworth, 2009</xref>). Therefore, care providers need not only education around the basic science of climate change, but the clinical phase of their education needs to appropriately synergize prevailing trends in health (e.g. outbreaks in Lyme's disease) directly to the broader phenomenon when appropriate.
