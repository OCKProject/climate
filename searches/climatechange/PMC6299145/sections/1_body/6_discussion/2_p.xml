<p id="p0100" class="p">US health care is a mosaic of elements. Government administers various programs and regulates, while a variety of for-profit businesses, non-profits and NGO's create their own health care infrastructures or augment the publicly administered ones. US health care is therefore necessarily collaborative. As addressing climate change requires extensive, uniquely complex forms of collaboration, the views of health care professionals on these collaborations are critical. There is substantial emphasis put upon the peer-reviewed medical literature in shaping views and policy. We observe an overwhelming preference for the public sector to provide primary support to health care for climate change activities. Furthermore, we expected this predilection to yield more emphasis on both political motivation and legislative strategy. Though this group was more likely to describe political motivation (33%) and advocate legislative strategy (69%) than authors who did not suggest partnering with the public sector (14%, 21%, respectively), they nevertheless preferred other strategies like education (95%) and advocacy (80%). This pattern remained consistent across stated roles with the exception of authors in the conformative role category, who never expressed political motivations (see 
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="graphic" class="xref">Exhibit 6</xref>). Consequently, we have concerns about the cohesion between ideals and proposed strategy. The data suggests here that medical professionals generalize climate change as a public sector problem, but that the pathways by which the public sector creates social and policy changes is subsequently under-regarded. Incomplete sentiments like these are risky. The cultural authority of US health care is such that the strategies it espouses have reverberating effects across contexts. This reality calls for the medical community to have a thorough and integrative understanding of how to approach climate change.
