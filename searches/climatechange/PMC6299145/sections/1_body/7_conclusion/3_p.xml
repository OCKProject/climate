 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kilmer and MacCoun (2017)</xref>, in a recent review, outline how critical the medical community has been in advocating, normalizing and explaining the benefits of medical marijuana to US populations. Many positive efforts have resulted in criminal justice, local economic, educational, and public receptivity to evidence-based social policy challenges. We believe this illustrates the substantive role health care still plays in shaping broader social, political and ethical trends. We hope that an analogue can be drawn for the approach health care takes towards climate change, and stress the need for similar levels of acuity and resolve to be further emphasized in their professional literature.
