<p id="p0120" class="p">Medical professionals have a substantial role to play in addressing the consequences of climate change. The nature of this role will be decided, in part, by how active or passive the approach of the medical community is. The divergence apparent in the peer-reviewed medical literature between the coming health consequences of climate change and policy decisions that are insufficient to address it will be catastrophic if realized. This literature review establishes broad themes for health care professional browsing their native literature on the relationship between climate change and US health care that beg further research. High levels were evident of enthusiasm and drive among medical professionals to act as agents for change on an individual and collective level, favoring the tools of education and advocacy to counter the urgency of various well-articulated public health concerns. These professionals were most alarmed by how rising air pollution, extreme weather, and increasingly ideal conditions for infectious/vector-borne diseases will damage US public health. Furthermore, they largely felt health care should forge partnerships with public and/or non-profit entities to tackle the problem, with greatest effort being dedicated towards revitalizing health care's energy resources. We call for further research, however, on the gap evident between high enthusiasm and inconsistent or ineffective strategies. For example, a factor discussed sparingly in this review, but with undoubtedly enormous consequences, is the threat posed by potential food system collapse (

For another, an emphasis on education and advocacy suggests that the perceived temporal urgency climate change poses to health care is still somewhat underestimated. Furthermore, the literature exhibited enthusiasm for partnering with public institutions, presumably to engage capable stakeholders in advocating for legislative change or addressing the political gridlock climate change embodies at multiple levels of governance. Further research on these themes can help the medical community orient their practices towards effectively addressing the problem. The many articles circulating on the topic of climate change and health gives us hope that health care will live into its powerful tradition of appropriately responding to human health concerns.
