<p id="p0095" class="p">Fourteen authors (19%) were categorized as non-M.D. medical academics; these largely called for proactivity (64%) or leadership (21%) from health care, with a preference for public partnerships (79%). They talked of the urgency of energy reform (64%), the effectiveness of education (93%) and the motivating quality of observable climate-related health trends (86%).

Despite small sample sizes, it was notable that both nurses and administrators were strongly inclined to favor mitigation-based strategies over adaptation-based ones. Otherwise, these groups largely mirrored the wider dataset.
