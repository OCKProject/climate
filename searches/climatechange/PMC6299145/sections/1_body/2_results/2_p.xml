<p id="p0060" class="p">We noted a substantial percentage of authors advocating for health care to take a proactive (59%) or leadership (32%) role in combatting climate change, as well as a broad engagement with both adaptation (76%) and mitigation (81%) strategies. The predominant health concerns motivating health care professionals were air pollution (83% articles), extreme weather events (77%) and infectious/vector-borne disease (75%). Less concern was evident over mental health (42%), migration (39%) and sanitation/housing (32%) issues caused by climate change. Education (92%) was overwhelmingly the preferred strategy for change. Advocacy measures were also regularly suggested (79%). With regards to carbon footprint reduction, authors focused upon energy sourcing (72%), most often in the form of renewable energy projects or schemes to reduce power utilization. Changes in food (36%), water (31%) and waste management (29%) systems were least common. Furthermore, 92% of the literature said climate-related health trends were motivation for engagement, whereas concerns about political issues were evident in only a third (33%) of the pieces. Health care professionals showed consistently strong support for partnerships with public institutions in order to achieve climate goals (81%). This compared with lesser support for partnerships with the private sector (24%), and even less for independent (i.e. no partnerships) strategies (12%).</p>
