<p id="p0065" class="p">The plurality (41%) of included literature came from institutions based in the south, as defined by the US Census regions. We suspect this is primarily because the region includes both Atlanta and Washington D.C., administrative homes of many large public and non-profit health care organizations e.g. Center for Disease Control. Southerners mainly took a proactive stance towards tackling climate change (61%), as did authors from the Northeast (47%), Midwest (50%) and West (73%) – there was no significance in the relationship between role and region

 </sup>(9, n = 75) = 6.38, p &gt; 0.05. All four regions identified education as the best intervention strategy, considered energy sourcing most opportune for a reduction in carbon footprint, and emphatically agreed that climate-induced health threats were the primary motivation for increased engagement. Among other motivating factors, ethical concerns were more common among Northeastern (52%) and Midwestern (60%) practitioners, whereas economic concerns prevailed for Southerners (73%) and those from the West (48%). All regions consistently highlighted three health concerns associated with climate change: (1) air pollution, which was the most common answer in the Northeast (84%) and West (100%), (2) infectious and vector-borne disease, which was the most common answer in Midwest (70%) and (3) extreme weather, which was the most common answer in the South (94%) and Midwest (also 70%). Partnership preference varied little by region.
