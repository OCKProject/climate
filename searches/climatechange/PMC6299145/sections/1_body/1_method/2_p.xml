<p id="p0030" class="p">This review is concerned with systematically investigating the role of US health care in responding to climate change from the vantage point of a health care professional routinely accessing medical literature. Accordingly, the data is limited to peer-reviewed literature indexed in medical databases â€“ we do not claim a total encapsulation of responses by all health care entities. We seek a perspectival, rather than exhaustive, literature review.</p>
