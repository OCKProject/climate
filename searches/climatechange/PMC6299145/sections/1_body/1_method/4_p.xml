Twenty-seven duplicate articles were immediately removed. Through Covidence, two authors reviewed the title and abstracts of each of the 4399 remaining articles. Disagreements were resolved through deliberative discussion. The inclusion criteria sent 401 articles to full-text review. This more detailed review process removed 334 more articles â€“ 163 were concerned with non-domestic health care, 53 were not authored by health care professionals, 44 contained no explicit policy recommendation, 36 were primarily concerned with an environmental issue other than climate change, 23 further duplicates emerged, and 15 did not fit the literature format for inclusion. Sixty-seven articles were finally included for full analysis and categorization. Two authors independently read each article in their entirety and organized them by categories.</p>
