<p class="p">The aims of the present study were to evaluate the PWD risk in 21 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species on a global scale and determine current and future changes in vulnerable regions with climate change. The MB index [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], which represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature and 15 when the mean monthly temperature exceeds 15Â°C, was used to determine vulnerable regions under current and future climate conditions. We also evaluated the impact of climate change on habitat suitability for each of the 21 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species then integrated all the findings in order to discuss the potential risk of PWD spread under future climate change.
