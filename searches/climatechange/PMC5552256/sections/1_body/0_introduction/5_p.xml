<p class="p">Climate change will also have direct effects on the growth of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests, with increasing temperatures negatively affecting the forest growth via aridification of regions where droughts is the primary constraint of growth and productivity [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Thus, changes in temperature and precipitation constitute a significant threat to 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests, even if undamaged by PWD. Increasing temperatures also affect host susceptibility to pathogens [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Thus, areas where habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species is likely to decrease in the future will be at high risk of PWD occurrence. Projecting the impact of climate change on both PWD risk and habitat suitability in 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> distribution areas is therefore important in terms of understanding those areas vulnerable to PWD.
