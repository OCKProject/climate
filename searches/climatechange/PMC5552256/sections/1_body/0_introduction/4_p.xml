<p class="p">The occurrence and spread of PWD is also likely to be affected by future climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], which is thought to be highly probable according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The increases in mean temperature and drought as a result of climate change could promote the spread of PWD into areas where the risk is low under current climatic conditions [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In addition, it has also been suggested that under cool climate conditions some PWNs, having infected 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> trees, do not cause disease symptoms for a number of years [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Therefore, increasing temperatures in the future could also activate these latent nematodes. Understanding the changing risks with climate change will therefore facilitate the establishment of measures aimed at prevention of future PWD outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. However, few studies have yet to evaluate the resulting risks under future climate change scenarios.
