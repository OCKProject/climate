<p class="p">Pine wilt disease (PWD) poses a serious threat to pine forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. The pine wood nematode (PWN, 
 <italic class="italic">Bursaphelenchus xylophilus</italic>) is the causal agent, while pine sawyer beetles (
 <italic class="italic">Monochamus</italic> spp.) act as a vector. PWN is thought to originate in North America [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], and thus, its wide distribution throughout the country is not associated with the epidemic disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], even though several 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species are susceptible to PWN [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In contrast, in Asia and Europe, PWN is an invasive pathogen introduced artificially from PWD-affected countries and subsequently causing damage to native 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> trees [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>,
