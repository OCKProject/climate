 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Damage to these forests by PWD would result in a largely modified forest structure, and consequently, forestry industries in these regions would be seriously damaged. On the other hand, in Portugal and Spain, two PWD-affected countries in Europe, almost all 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> distribution areas were categorized as vulnerable to PWD in the future. Increased attention to future PWD risks in these regions is therefore required, even though establishment of PWN has been limited under current climatic conditions.
