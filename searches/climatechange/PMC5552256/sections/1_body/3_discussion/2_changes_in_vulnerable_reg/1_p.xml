<p class="p">Regions vulnerable to PWD were projected to expand towards northern parts of Europe, Asia, and North America under each RCP climate change scenario; however, the range of expansion differed (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182837.s003" class="xref">S3 Fig</xref>). This indicates that the risk of PWD outbreaks in new areas depends on the extent of mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. Even if greenhouse gas emissions are reduced to limit the increase in global average temperatures to &lt; 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels (i.e., RCP 2.6), vulnerable regions will spread further north. However, it should be noted that because the expansion of PWD is affected not only by climate factors, but also by the dispersal capacity of insect vectors, the transportation of infected logs to non-infected regions, and susceptibility of host trees [

 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], the vulnerable regions projected in our study do not necessarily represent realistic expansion of PWD throughout these regions. Nevertheless, the risk of PWD outbreaks in these regions will increase with global climate change.
