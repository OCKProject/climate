<p class="p">Overall, our study suggests that future climate change scenarios are likely to result in serious PWD-related damage and habitat degradation to global 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests. To develop suitable management strategies, it is therefore important to understand the functional roles of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests and reach a consensus on the functions these 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests should perform. Repeated and consistent monitoring of the impacts of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests are therefore required, not only from an economic viewpoint, but also in terms of ecosystem structure and services.
