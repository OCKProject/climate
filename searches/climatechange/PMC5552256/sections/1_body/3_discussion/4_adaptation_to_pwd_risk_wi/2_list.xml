  <p class="p">Regions vulnerable to PWD and habitat degradation</p>
  <p specific-use="continuation" class="p">Our results suggest that regions of this type, in which the risk of a PWD outbreak is particularly high, are widely distributed in East Europe and Asia under RCP 8.5 (dark brown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). In East Europe and North Asia, most of these regions are not adjacent to current PWD-affected regions, and thus, preventing the artificial introduction of PWN is one of the most important adaptation measures. The introduction of PWN into non-native areas is primarily associated with trade and global flow of forest products [
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]; thus, it is important to understand the possible pathways of PWN and prevent the import of infected forest products. In 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> plantation forests, logging of pine trees prior to the occurrence of PWD and reforestation of non-
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species might be valuable in avoiding unexpected PWD spread and conserving forest ecosystems, not least because environmental conditions in these regions may become unsuitable for 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species due to climate change.

  <p class="p">Regions vulnerable to PWD</p>
  <p specific-use="continuation" class="p">It was predicted that regions of this type are primarily distributed in South Europe and East Asia, overlapping or near to current PWD-infected regions (orange in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>). Thus, adaptation measures aimed at preventing further spread of PWN, such as logging and fumigation or burning of infected trees [
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>,
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], are recommended. If, however, PWD spread does occur, programs aimed at reforestation of damaged forests may be necessary. Unlike the regions vulnerable to both PWD and habitat degradation, these regions would not suffer the effects of habitat degradation due to climate change. Thus, in regions where 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species play an important role in forestry and culture, reforestation of 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests might be possible if the total eradication of PWN from the site is successful prior to reforestation. Reforestation using resistant pines, which have been bred in Japan and mainland China [

   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], may also be effective.

  <p class="p">Regions vulnerable to habitat degradation</p>
  <p specific-use="continuation" class="p">In regions of this type (yellow in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>), the PWD risk in the future is relatively low; however, our results predict that climate change will result in deterioration of habitat conditions for 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species. Although responses of each 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species to climate change remain uncertain, it has been suggested that drought and warming decrease growth and increase mortality of 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> trees [
   <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Continuous monitoring of the effects of climate change on 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> populations is therefore recommended, even though it is difficult to distinguish the effects of climate alone and the results of natural succession. Climate change might induce a range shift in some 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species outside of their current distribution areas. In this study, we evaluated changes in habitat suitability within natural distribution areas only. Protection of migration routes surrounding current distribution areas might therefore be a valuable adaptation strategy.

   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests of this type (green in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref>) will not be affected by the spread of PWD or habitat degradation caused by climate change. These regions are therefore likely to remain stable during climate change and will become key regions for the conservation of 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests. In particular, in valuable old-growth 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests, management plans aimed at avoiding artificial alteration such as the establishment of protected areas is recommended.
