<p class="p">Under RCP 2.6, almost all boreal 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> forests fell outside the regions vulnerable to PWD in the 2070s. However, estimates of the effect of climate change revealed a decrease in habitat suitability in some areas, probably due to increasing temperatures and aridification. Climate change may therefore result in a decline in these boreal 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> trees, despite the low risk of PWD damage. Moreover, under RCP 8.5, vulnerable habitats for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species expanded not only in Europe and North Asia but also in East Asia, approximately 40% of these areas overlapped with the regions deemed vulnerable to PWD. These findings suggest that these regions are at higher risk than other vulnerable regions containing non-vulnerable habitats.
