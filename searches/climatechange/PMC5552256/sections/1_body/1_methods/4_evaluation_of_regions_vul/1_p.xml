<p class="p">According to the isograms of the MB index, areas falling within the natural distributions of susceptible 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species were classified into the following three risk categories: 1) regions of low vulnerability where the MB index is &lt; 19°C months, 2) moderately vulnerable regions where the MB index is ≥ 19°C and &lt; 22°C months, and 3) vulnerable regions where the MB index is ≥ 22°C months [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. The MB index for classifying areas at risk was originally prepared for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">densiflora</italic> forests, with reference to decreasing levels of damage where PWD had fully spread after a long history of infestation. However, this situation is not expected for other 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species, and therefore, setting the threshold indices for each species poses a challenge. We therefore extrapolated the thresholds for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">densiflora</italic> to other species to evaluate PWD risks on a global scale.
