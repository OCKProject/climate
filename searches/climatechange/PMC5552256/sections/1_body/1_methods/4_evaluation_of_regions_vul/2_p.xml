<p class="p">Vulnerable regions under current and future climate conditions were subsequently mapped for the four RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and the area of vulnerable regions was calculated for all and respective 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species. In calculating the area of vulnerable regions, we masked regions by forest land since the distribution areas of some 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species were drawn as large polygons containing many non-forest areas. The forest land mask was created using the 2001 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land cover map classified by the International Geosphere Biosphere Programme (IGBP) land cover classification derived from the Global Land Cover Characteristics Database Version 2.0. Areas falling within the forest categories were used as the forest land mask.
