<p class="p">In the present study, we attempted to compare the differences among four different representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and two future time periods. RCPs represent a set of greenhouse gas concentrations and emission pathways [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], a higher RCP representing larger emissions and more rapid global warming. We subsequently calculated eight MB indices for the four different RCPs (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) and two time periods (2050s and 2070s). For the future MB indices, it is important to consider the uncertainty among the general circulation models (GCMs). We therefore used five GCMs of the World Climate Research Program’s (WCRP’s) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model dataset, which is available in the WorldClim dataset. The five GCMs were as follows: GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M. Finally, MB indices calculated using the five GCMs were averaged for each RCP and each time period, thereby resulting in eight future MB indices (four for the 2050s and four for the 2070s) prepared for the following analysis.
