<p class="p">A dataset of mean monthly temperatures under current and future climate conditions was prepared using the WorldClim dataset (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org</ext-link>). For the current MB index, the 30-year mean monthly temperatures between 1960 and 1990 were used, while for future MB indices, a set of 20-year mean monthly temperatures between 2041 and 2060 (hereafter, the 2050s) and 2061 and 2080 (hereafter, the 2070s) was determined by averaging the minimum and maximum temperatures provided by WorldClim. The spatial resolution of the present study was set at 30â€³ (approximately 1 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> spatial resolution at the equator).
