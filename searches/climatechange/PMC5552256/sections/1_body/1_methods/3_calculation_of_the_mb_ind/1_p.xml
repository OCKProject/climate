<p class="p">In Japan, the MB index was proposed to explain the known distribution of PWD-affected areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. According to the concept of effective accumulative temperature, the MB index represents the sum of the difference between the mean monthly temperature (Tm) and 15 when the mean monthly temperature exceeds 15°C; that is, ∑(Tm-15) when Tm ≥ 15. Originally, it was thought that severe PWD damage would not occur when the MB index is below 40°C months; however, this hypothesis was proven invalid by subsequent prevalence in such areas. The relationship between the level of damage due to PWD and MB index in several areas where PWD has fully spread was therefore re-examined, and a new threshold of 22°C months for the occurrence of severe PWD damage in

 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. As a result, this new MB threshold has been used to successfully explain the range limit of PWD in the affected areas in Japan. Owing to the ease of calculation and the predictive accuracy, the MB index is now regarded as a powerful tool for evaluation of PWD risk, although the differences in susceptibility among
