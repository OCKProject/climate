<p class="p">The effects of climate change on habitat suitability for 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species were evaluated using species distribution models aimed at estimating the relationship between species occurrence at a site and the environmental and / or spatial characteristics of this site [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. We estimated the potential distribution areas of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species under current and future (2070s) climatic conditions then evaluated the changes in habitat suitability with climate change in their natural distribution areas. Areas in which conditions may become climatically unsuitable in the future despite being currently suitable were evaluated as vulnerable (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182837.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Because the migration of 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species up till the 2070s was not thought to be considerable, we evaluated future changes in habitat suitability in their natural distribution areas only.
