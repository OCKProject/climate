<p class="p">Distribution models were generated using the maximum entropy model (Maxent ver 3.3) [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], which uses presence-only data to predict the distribution of a species based on the theory of the maximum entropy method [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. The performance of the Maxent model is influenced by certain parameters [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. In the present study, we therefore changed some parameters from the default settings. In the feature setting, which consists of environmental variables and functions thereof [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>], all features were used in each model. The regularization parameter (betamultiplier) was set to 2.5 to facilitate the creation of less complex and smoother models and to avoid over-fitting of parameters to the evaluation dataset [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>].
