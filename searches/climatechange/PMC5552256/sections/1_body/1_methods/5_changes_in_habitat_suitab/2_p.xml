<p class="p">The effects of climate change on habitat suitability were evaluated for 18 susceptible 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> species, excluding 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">radiata</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">luchuensis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">muricata</italic>, whose distributions are localized (coastal and island areas). Occurrence data for these species were derived from Critchfield and Little [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], who projected species distributions as points and areas. Point data were changed to digital data using GIS, and area data to digital point data as described below. First, we changed area data into grid data, which were masked by forest area. Random points were then generated within these grid data (1 point / 2,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). A total of 100 points were generated, even if the grid area of a given species was â‰¤ 2,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>.
