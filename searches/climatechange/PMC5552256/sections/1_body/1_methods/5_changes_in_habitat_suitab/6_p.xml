<p class="p">Five-fold cross-validation was used for the assessment of model performance, and averaged AUC [area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve] across the five iterations was used to evaluate model performances for each species. Occurrence probability was converted into a binary (suitable versus unsuitable habitat) using a threshold, thereby maximizing the sum of sensitivity and specificity, which has been proven valid for use with presence-only data such as Maxent [
 <xref rid="pone.0182837.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. For future models, we constructed models for five GCMs under each RCP, and averaged the occurrence probabilities of the five models. Thereafter, we detected potential vulnerable habitats wherein habitat suitability changed from suitable in the current to unsuitable in the future (
