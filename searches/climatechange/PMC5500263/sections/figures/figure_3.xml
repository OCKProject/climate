  <title class="title">Trends in southern Rocky Mountain lake thermal regimes.</title>
  <p class="p">Example plots of thermal change (1988â€“2085) and the uncertainty analysis for these rates of change in three thermal metrics for three representative lakes. These lakes span the range of relative thermal regimes observed which include cold (Odessa Lake; a-c), cool (Ypsilon Lake; d-f), and warm (Sandbeach Lake; g-i). Thermal metrics presented are the mean annual lake surface temperature (a,d,g), the mean summer lake surface temperature (b,e,h), and number of ice-free days (c,f,i). Green trend lines represent the upper and lower bounds of future thermal trends. These bounds are calculated using the highest and lowest projected mean weekly air temperatures from both climate models combined.</p>
