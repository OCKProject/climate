  <p class="p">Location, relative size, and juxtaposition of each study lake. Maps show portions of the Flat Tops Wilderness (A.) and Rocky Mountain National Park (B.) within the Southern Rocky Mountains. Model predictions of M30AT in the 2080s are shown in color for each of the 27 lakes, and the predicted increase in the number of ice-free days (IFD) over seven decades (circles). The three lakes that are labeled were used to present our uncertainty analysis (see
