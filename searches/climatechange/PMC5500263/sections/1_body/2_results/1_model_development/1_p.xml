<p class="p">The models of surface temperature for each of the 27 lakes had an average NSC value of 0.83, although the model parameters and fit varied among lakes (NSC range 0.68–0.91; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s002" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>). The average model parameter for maximum temperature (α) was 20.1°C, the average parameter for minimum temperature (μ) was 0.0°C, the average
