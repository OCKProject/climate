 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). However, Arrowhead Lake is currently too cold for young fish survival and Caddis Lake is currently cold enough to decrease the survival of young fish (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). By the 2080s the models predict that none of these 27 lakes will be too cold for growth and survival of young fish, although two will be too warm. The models predict a mean M30AT of 15.0°C for the 27 lakes in the 2080s, which is considered optimal for growth and survival. Nevertheless, two individual lakes, Spruce Lake and Sandbeach Lake will be warm enough to reduce the growth rate of adult cutthroat trout by the 2080s (
