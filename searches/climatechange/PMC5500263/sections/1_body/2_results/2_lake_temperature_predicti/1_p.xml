<p class="p">We used the measured and predicted air temperature in our models of lake temperature to predict daily lake surface temperature during past, current, and future periods for each of the 27 lakes, the slopes at all lakes are significant at α = 0.05 (

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0179498.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the magnitude of change in MST was roughly double that predicted for MAT. The current MST of 9.8°C (5.9–13.7) increased to 12.7°C (8.3–16.8) by the 2080s, a 30% mean increase, resulting in an overall rate of increase of 0.47°C ·decade

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>), whereas the mean M30AT predicted for the 2080s is 15.0°C, an increase of 2.9°C or 24% from current conditions (
