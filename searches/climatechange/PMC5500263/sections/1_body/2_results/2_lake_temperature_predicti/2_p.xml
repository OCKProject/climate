<p class="p">The uncertainty analysis showed that both the upper and lower bounds for all the thermal metrics are predicted to increase for all the lakes through the 2080s (

However, with time, the spread of the upper and lower bounds also increased about the mean trends for these three thermal metrics. The variation in the trend was greatest for MAT, for which the upper and lower bounds averaged ±45% lower and higher (0.13–0.36, respectively), than the mean rate for all the lakes of 0.25°C ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Variation was less for IFD, for which the average bounds were ±36% lower and higher (3.51–7.79) than the mean rate of 5.9 days ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, and even less for MST, for which the average bounds were ±35% lower and higher (0.30–0.63) than the mean rate of 0.47°C ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. Across the gradient of thermal conditions, the thermal metrics of a representative warm lake (Sandbeach Lake) increased at greater rates and were more variable than a cool (Ypsilon Lake) or cold (Odessa Lake) lake.
