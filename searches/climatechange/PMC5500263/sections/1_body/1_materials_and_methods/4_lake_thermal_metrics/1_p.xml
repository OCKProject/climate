<p class="p">We used the daily values of lake surface temperature reconstructed and predicted from forecasting to calculate four lake thermal metrics (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0179498.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). The first is a measure of fish habitat quality [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and represents the warmest 30-day running mean of daily mean water temperature (M30AT). The other three metrics are the mean annual surface water temperature (MAT), the mean summer surface water temperature (mean for June-August of each year; MST), and the number of ice-free days (sum of days with a daily mean lake surface temperature ≥4°C for each year; IFD). This estimate of IFD is based on lake hydrodynamics and assumes that when the lake surface water is 4°C (i.e., the value at which liquid water is most dense) the entire water column is iso-thermal with no ice cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. We summarize these thermal metrics at three different time horizons: current (2004–2014), 2040s (2035–2045), and 2080s (2075–2085). We also used the annual predictions of these metrics to examine trends (i.e., rates of change) in our thermal metrics from 1986–2002 (depending on the record of the closest SNOTEL site) through 2085 using linear regression (α = 0.05), with year as the independent variable. We used the slopes from these linear regressions to represent the rate of change for each temperature metric, and present all results as rates of change ·decade
