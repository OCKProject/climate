<p class="p">We assessed the thermal habitat quality for native fishes (Cutthroat Trout) in these mountain lakes using eco-physiological thresholds defined in the literature. Roberts et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] related M30AT to growth and recruitment of Cutthroat Trout in SRM streams and defined five eco-physiological states which are directly relevant to thermal habitat quality of mountain lakes for these fish. Briefly, a M30AT below 8.0°C is too cold for growth and survival of young trout. Temperatures in the 8.0–9.0°C range are cold enough to restrict the survival of young trout up to age-1. However, higher temperatures (9.1–18.0°C) are optimal for growth and recruitment of trout, while even warmer temperatures (18.1–19.9°C) can reduce growth. Finally, temperatures in excess of 20.0°C limit or stop growth of Cutthroat Trout [
