<p class="p">We created a separate model of daily mean lake surface temperature for each lake. We used air temperature from the nearest SNOTEL site (via Euclidian distance) and selected data to match the period of lake temperature record. We used mean weekly air temperature as a predictor of daily mean lake surface temperature (

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This modeled relationship represents how air temperature and lake surface temperature co-vary, with extreme low air temperature rarely driving lake temperature below 0Â°C and an asymptotic upper limit of lake temperature controlled by evaporative cooling [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. Model parameters were fit using a non-linear least-squares loss function and the Gauss-Newton algorithm. All models were fit using SYSTAT 12 software (Chicago, IL). We evaluated model fit using the Nash Sutcliffe Coefficient (NSC; [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]) where a perfect model fit receives a value of 1 and a poor model fit can receive negative values. The NSC is a more effective measure than the Root Mean Squared Error for evaluating the fit of non-linear models [
