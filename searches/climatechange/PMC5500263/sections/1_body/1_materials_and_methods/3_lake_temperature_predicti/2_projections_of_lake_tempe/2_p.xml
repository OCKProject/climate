<p class="p">We performed an uncertainty analysis using each of the two climate models to create a new data-series of highest and lowest predicted daily mean air temperatures, since the highest and lowest value for a given day were not consistently associated with one model. Using this dataset of predicted high and low daily air temperature we calculated mean weekly high and low air temperatures. We then used these to predict high and low daily surface water temperature for each lake, which defined the upper and lower bounds of our predictions (
