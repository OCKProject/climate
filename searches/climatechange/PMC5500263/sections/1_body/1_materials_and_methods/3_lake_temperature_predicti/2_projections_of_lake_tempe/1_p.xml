The spatial resolution of these climate projections is 15x5-km grid cells, and projections are available for short-term (2035–2045) and long-term (2075–2085) time horizons. We used daily output of surface air temperature from the PSU/OSU GENMOM (GNM; [

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]) under the A2 emission scenario from the IPCC AR4 (International Panel of Climate Change) which assumes a medium-to-high emissions future [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The A2 emission scenario is most similar to the RCP 8.5 carbon scenario used in the newest IPCC AR5 efforts [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Moreover, the GNM and ECH climate models were the only two models from Hostetler et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] that provided daily output suitable for our analysis. We compared daily air temperatures measured at each SNOTEL site used in this study with temperatures predicted from each climate model within the overlaying grid cell of each SNOTEL site for 2010–2012 (the only overlapping years available) and created an average monthly correction factor. We applied this additive monthly correction factor to all climate projections before predicting lake surface temperature (
