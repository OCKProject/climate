<p class="p">We acquired air temperature records from the snow telemetry (SNOTEL) network and created a database of the 21 SRM SNOTEL sites nearest the lakes with temperature data. Daily summaries of average air temperature (Â°C) were downloaded from the SNOTEL webportal (

We used this metric as the independent variable to create water temperature models of daily mean lake surface temperatures for each lake and, in turn, to predict past and future lake temperatures.
