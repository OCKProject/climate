<p class="p">We compiled data for 27 lakes, the majority of which are in Rocky Mountain National Park (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>), all of which had continuous records at least 2 years long (range: 2 to 15 years). Temperature was recorded every 60 minutes for the entire duration of each continuous lake record. We performed an initial quality check of these data using protocols established for stream temperature data [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Only georeferenced data collected within the top 3 meters of the water column or located within the first 250m of the lake inlet or outlet stream were included in our analysis. Hydrogeomorphic site characteristics for each lake (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0179498.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>) were collected during logger deployment (maximum depth and elevation) and downloaded from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus Version 2 (surface area and cumulative drainage area; NHDPlusV2;

To use the data collected in Rocky Mountain National Park we received approval for this project from the park and we performed this research under a Scientific Research and Collection Permit (#ROMO-2013-SCI-0009).
