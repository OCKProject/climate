<p class="p">High-elevation lakes, like those in the SRM, provide critical fish habitat, and changes to thermal characteristics are likely to alter fish life histories. Although it is unknown how many of these lakes were naturally fishless, owing to extensive stocking of native and non-native fishes initiated around the turn of the 20

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>], it is likely that some of the lakes in our analysis were fishless. Of the 27 lakes in our analysis, 23 currently have fish populations. One critical life history event for fish in high-elevation lakes is the movement between lakes and connecting streams for spawning. The phenology of spawning migrations can be shifted earlier for spring spawning fish [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] and later for fall spawning fish [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] when adult fish are exposed to increasing temperature in lake-stream networks. Earlier spawning events can result in a longer growing season for young-of-the-year fish. However, the growth and survival of young fish is a function of both temperature and prey availability [

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Shifts in the timing of spawning events could result in a trophic mismatch of prey availability and demand during early life history events for fish [

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>], but such a phenomenon requires heterogeneity in seasonal warming rates [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. The differences in warming rates between high-elevation SRM streams [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and those reported for SRM lakes in this study indicate heterogeneity in warming rates and therefore, the potential for climate driven trophic mismatches during early fish life history. Paradoxically, the growth potential of adult fish in SRM high-elevation lakes may actually increase because these systems are currently quite cold, but this will vary by species and also be dictated by how prey (i.e., lower trophic levels) respond to these changing thermal conditions.
