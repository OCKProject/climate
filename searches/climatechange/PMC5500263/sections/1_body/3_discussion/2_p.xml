<p class="p">The most striking thermal change for these high-elevation lakes is the 29% increase (i.e., a mean increase of 37 days) in IFD by the 2080s. Increasing length of the ice-free season has been observed and predicted for lakes worldwide, based on long records of lake and river surface freeze and thaw dates [

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. For example, a comprehensive assessment of ice cover for freshwater systems in the northern hemisphere observed (1822–1995) a 1.7 day decade 
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> increase in ice free days in 11 lakes (a subset of the water bodies included in the study; [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]). Our forecasted average increase in ice free days (5.9 days ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) is much greater than that observed in the recent past; nevertheless, the higher rates we predicted are supported by other models of future increases, such as an increase of 10–26 ice-free days in Canadian lakes by 2055 [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Another study using models of generic lakes across the contiguous United States predicted that a scenario where atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations doubled (no time period specified) from past levels (i.e., 1961–1979) could result in 90 more ice free days in lakes, depending on location [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. An empirical study of one watershed in the SRM also supports our results, reporting that ice is thawing 2.1 days ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> earlier (average decadal rate, 1981–2014; [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]), which is similar to half (2.95 days ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) the change we predict for IFD. These changes in length of IFD are also likely to influence important ecological processes occurring during ice-cover, processes that are understudied and are important drivers of the ecosystem functions in temperate lakes [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Our study is the first to model the change in IFD for relatively cold, high-elevation lakes, and shows that these lakes will also lose ice at a drastic rate, similar to those predicted for lakes at lower elevations.
