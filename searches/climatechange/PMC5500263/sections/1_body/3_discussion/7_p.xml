<p class="p">Although our results predict striking changes in the thermal regime of SRM high-elevation lakes, data were available for a relatively small sample of lakes arrayed in two fairly restricted regions of the SRM in Colorado. Thus, it is unlikely that we have characterized the full range of lake thermal response across the SRM landscape. Given the affordability and availability of commercial temperature loggers, the scope of future studies could be easily expanded to include collection of continuous lake temperatures. Additionally, new lake temperature data could easily be added to our predictive model approach (sensu [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]) to further explore the influence of climate change on high-elevation lakes. Ideally, a more comprehensive database of continuous temperatures could be used to create models for mountain lakes similar to the useful resources already available for mountain stream networks (e.g., NorWeST;

Mountain lakes are important headwater sources of relatively pristine habitat for ecological communities and water for human uses, so understanding how changing climatic conditions are influencing these lakes is paramount to creating climate-smart management strategies for water resources and the biota that inhabit them.
