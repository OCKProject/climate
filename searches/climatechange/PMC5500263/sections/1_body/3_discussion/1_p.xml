<p class="p">The surface temperature and IFD of high-elevation lakes in the SRM have already increased with warming climatic conditions, and are projected to increase more in the coming decades. The magnitude of these changes are greater than reported trends for lakes worldwide. For example, the predicted MST increase of 0.47°C ·decade
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> is more than a 0.10°C greater than the predicted increase of 0.34°C ·decade

However, our results indicate that temperature increases are unlikely to be great enough by the 2080s to make most of these lakes thermally unsuitable for native top predators (i.e., Cutthroat Trout) in these systems. Nevertheless, the magnitude of these changes is substantial. For example, the 30% and 41% predicted increases in MST and MAT, respectively, are likely to have unexpected consequences for abiotic characteristics, biogeochemical processes, and trophic dynamics of these important SRM headwater habitats, and hold the potential to cause ecological surprises [
