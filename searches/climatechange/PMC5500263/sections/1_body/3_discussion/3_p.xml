<p class="p">Our models predict that these lakes will warm at a faster rate than streams and rivers within the Rocky Mountain region. The MST in streams in the upper Columbia River drainage (Northern Rocky Mountains) is predicted to increase 2.1째C by the 2080s [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>], substantially lower than our model predicted MST increase of 2.9째C. Likewise, we predict that lake M30AT will increase 2.9째C by the 2080s, nearly three-fold higher than the increase of 1.1째C predicted for high-elevation streams in the upper Colorado River basin [
 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The greater increase in lake temperatures when compared to streams and rivers in the SRM underscores the need to determine which thermal properties are driving ecosystem processes in these high-elevation lakes, to allow a better understanding of the ecological consequences of these thermal changes.
