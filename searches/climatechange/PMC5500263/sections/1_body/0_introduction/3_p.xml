<p class="p">Mountain lakes and associated headwater regions also provide critical refuge habitats for native species throughout the SRM, many of which are imperiled (e.g., Cutthroat Trout

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]). Various aspects of climate change, including warming temperatures, have the potential to alter the unique habitats that these lakes provide. However, the influence of changing climatic conditions on mountain lakes in the SRM has been previously addressed mostly through broad scale generic modeling of North American lakes (i.e., [

Thus, uncertainty remains regarding how the thermal conditions of SRM lakes have changed in the past, the magnitude of likely future changes, and the potential landscape-level consequences of these changes for lake-dependent species and ecosystem processes.
