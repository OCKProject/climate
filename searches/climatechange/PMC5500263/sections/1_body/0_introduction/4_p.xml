<p class="p">Here we use continuous records of surface water temperature for individual lakes and weather station measurements of air temperature to create statistical models of daily mean lake surface temperature. The fine-scale temporal resolution of our predictions facilitates detailed analyses of SRM lake thermal regimes. We combine these statistical models with dynamically downscaled regional climate model predictions to forecast lake surface water temperature trends over the next 70 years, and test the hypothesis that mountain lakes in the SRM are warming in response to climate change. Our model results provide information and models crucial to the creation of climate-smart management and conservation plans for mountain lakes and their biota.</p>
