<p class="p">Although changing thermal conditions are predicted for lakes of all sizes and types, the influence of a changing climate on abiotic and biotic conditions of high-elevation mountain lakes remains poorly studied. Small lakes are common features of mountainous landscapes, where headwater systems function as important drivers of watershed processes [

Within the SRM, a semi-arid portion of western North America, mountain lakes and corresponding headwater networks influence important water management decisions through their storage and release of snowmelt, an important hydrologic driver of streams, rivers, and reservoirs [

 <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Therefore, understanding how high-elevation mountain lakes respond to climate change is important for water management in the SRM and other regions where anthropogenic needs depend on mountain hydrology.
