  <p class="p">The mean weekly air temperature (°C) values from the closest SNOTEL station to each of 27 SRM lakes. This included both observed data (1998–2013) and monthly corrected projections from downscaled regional climate models (2035–2045, 2075–2085; [
   <xref rid="pone.0179498.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]). These observed data were used to fit models of daily mean lake surface temperature. Both the observed and projected air temperature data were also used to reconstruct and forecast daily mean lake surface temperature.
