<p class="p">To accomplish this, high-temporal resolution (minimum ∼1 h) meteorological data are required to model small (cm scale) changes in point mass balance. This is particularly true for glacial systems that are strongly impacted by diurnal meteorological forcing
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50" class="xref">50</xref>. For Mullins and Friedman glaciers, modern meteorological data can be measured at a variety of prescribed resolutions, but these data must be simulated for past climate regimes. As described below, we accomplish this through directly altering, with a set of transfer functions based on paleoclimate data, several years of measured modern meteorological data to represent past conditions. With this simulated meteorological data set, we then execute the EBM (at a one hour time step over our simulation period of 12 years) to compute the estimated average annual point mass balance for any time (and associated climate configuration, for example, orbital forcing) in the climate record.
