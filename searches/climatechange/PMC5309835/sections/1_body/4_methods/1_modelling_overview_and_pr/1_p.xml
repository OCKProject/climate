<p class="p">We investigate mass balance within the critical zone of Mullins and Friedman glaciers (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) with an EBM driven with (1) modern conditions, (2) single parameter (atmospheric temperature, snowfall, solar insolation) perturbations from these modern conditions and (3) conditions that are representative of local climate conditions over the past ∼230 ka. The EBM is then coupled to a model for the development of supraglacial debris layers (and subsequent IDL) in the critical zone. We do not include variations in ice flow or the net/spatially distributed mass balance over the entire glacier.
