<p class="p">We compute the annual average mass balance at two locations within the critical zone of Mullins Glacier. Location one (L01) is located immediately adjacent to the primary meteorological station (AWS01), and is ∼100 m down valley from, and 15 m lower, than the modern equilibrium line. L01 is used to validate our model under modern conditions; it is also used to test the relative magnitude of accumulation/ablation forcing and its resulting impact on mass balance in the critical zone for past climate configurations. When modelled over conditions representative of the past 230 ka, the mass balance at L01 shows cyclical fluctuations in magnitude, but remains negative at each time step. We modelled a second location (L02), situated ∼400 m up-valley and ∼100 m higher than L01 (for example, within the modern ice-accumulation area) and adjust L02's meteorological parameters from those measured at L01 by including (1) a constant air temperature decrease of 1 °C according to an average lapse rate of 9.8 °C km
