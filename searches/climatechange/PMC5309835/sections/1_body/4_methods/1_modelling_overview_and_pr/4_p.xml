<p class="p">Starting at 230 ka BP and moving forward in time at 0.5 ka time steps, we couple the mass balance results for L02 to a geomorphic model for the development of supraglacial debris/IDL under conditions of negative mass balance (see below). The geomorphic model computes the accumulated thickness of supraglacial debris over time. When the mass balance at L02 returns to a positive value, we assume burial of the supraglacial debris layer (following a small time lag to account for enhanced ablation of new snowfall due to the lower albedo of the rocky debris surface, see below).</p>
