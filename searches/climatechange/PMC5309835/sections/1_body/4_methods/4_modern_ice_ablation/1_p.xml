<p class="p">We measured ablation directly by installing an array of 1.25-inch PVC ablation stakes in the uppermost ablation areas of both Mullins (11 stakes, installed 2010) and Friedman glaciers (5 stakes, installed 2011)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Stakes were measured annually in mid-December for repeat analysis of (1) ice loss (the measured distance from top of the stake to ice surface) and (2) geographic position. All stakes were installed on bare ice. Geographic positions for each stake were computed with a Trimble 5700 global positioning system, a Zephyr geodetic antenna and utilized a minimum 50-min residence time. Post processed kinematic differential location correction was performed with data from a base station located ∼7 km away on University Peak (77.86259°S, 160.75983°W; 2,195.3 m). Results over a 3–4-year baseline indicate that the modern ablation of exposed glacier ice in the uppermost ablation areas on Mullins and Friedman glaciers average 5.56 cm a
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic>=2.1), respectively, with the stake located closest to AWS01 averaging a slightly higher ablation rate of 7.1 cm a
