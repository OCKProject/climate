<p class="p">To assess aerodynamic roughness near AWS01, we installed a vertical array of four Onset Computer Corporation cup-style anemometers spaced at roughly logarithmic heights of 0.28, 0.66, 1.34 and 2.2 m, ∼3 m from AWS01; this array sampled data every 30 s, stored at 5  min intervals, for average wind velocity, maximum gust velocity and wind direction (top anemometer only) for the period 11/29/2010 to 12/09/2010. Wind data were processed with a 15-min running average to reduce noise.</p>
