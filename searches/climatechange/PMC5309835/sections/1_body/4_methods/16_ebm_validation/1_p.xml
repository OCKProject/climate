<p class="p">When executed using modern meteorological conditions and tuned to measured initial conditions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>), the EBM model results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 7,8</xref>) broadly agree with other energy balance studies in the region, for example, refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77" class="xref">77</xref>, as to the magnitude, direction and seasonal timing of major energy flux components. To validate the effectiveness of the EBM in capturing the physical dynamics of our system, we directly compare modelled surface temperatures and ablation rates against measured surface temperatures and ablation stake data at L01 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 9,10</xref>). Surface temperatures agree within a mean absolute error of 1.4 °C over the full time period. Importantly, the error drops to MAE=∼0.5 °C during the summer period when the majority of ablation occurs. Modelled mean annual point mass balance at L01 (6.7 cm a
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) agrees well with the collocated ablation stake at L01 (7.1 cm a
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and within margin of the measured mean of all ablation stakes in the critical zone of Mullins Glacier (5.56 cm a
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Finally, when large (&gt;2 cm snow depth) snowfall events occurred over bare ice, we use the time-lapse camera record to confirm the modelled dynamics of snowpack evolution and ablation. Although limited in temporal resolution, this exercise demonstrates excellent agreement between the observed and modelled ephemeral snow pack ablation rate.
