<p class="p">Snowfall in Mullins and Friedman valleys is sourced from a combination of (1) direct atmospheric precipitation, typically associated with coastal storm tracks, and (2) wind-transported snow sourced from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. In December 2010, we deployed a series of time-lapse cameras to capture the frequency and approximate magnitude of snowfall events in and around the critical zone of Mullins Glacier. The time step of repeat images ranged from 1 to 6 h, depending on the season. Due to intermittent instrument failure and the lack of light in the polar winter, the data are discontinuous across the 2-year deployment period (01/2011–01/2013). 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> shows our snowfall record for the measurement period. To convert fresh snowfall to cm water equivalent, we used the average of several density measurements (104 kg m
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) of fresh snowfall collected on site during the 2011 and 2012 field seasons.
