We (1) eliminate those measurements taken at the lowest solar azimuth angles (all winter measurements and all records that are &gt;5 h from solar noon), (2) disregard records within 10 days following a fresh snowfall event and (3) compute the mean (0.45). We purposely bias our albedo estimate toward values near solar noon (highest zenith angles) because the sensitivity of the land surface energy balance to albedo is the highest during periods of high

We do not model the zenith angle dependency of albedo. We address the modelled albedo change through time as a function of changing surface type below.
