 <sub class="sub">p1</sub>, 1 cm) is the approximate debris thickness at which a ‘continuous' debris cover is observed in the field. While fresh snowfall can persist and accumulate on bare ice/perennial snow banks, direct observations and time-lapse camera data (see ‘Methods' section) show that snowfall rapidly ablates off continuous debris covers. The value of threshold #2 (

 <sub class="sub">p2</sub>, 3 cm) corresponds to the minimum approximate debris thickness at which the ablation of polar debris-covered ice can be reasonably represented by a vapour diffusion model. The exact value for this parameter is currently not well constrained. However, 3–7 cm is broadly indicated by the measurements/modelling of ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>; it is also a reasonable depth where direct sensible heat transfer is mostly eliminated. Choosing a value on the low end for this threshold range results in reduced modelled thickness of surface debris in critical zones. In doing so, we are imposing a conservative estimate to the thickness of the debris layers (and hence IDL) that can form. When modelled using a higher value for threshold #2 (for example, 7 cm), the modelled IDL thicknesses only increases by ∼20%.
