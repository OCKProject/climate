<p class="p">Following Mackay and Marchant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>, we model the development of a layer of supraglacial debris using the framework of a 1-D column of ablating dirty ice. Within this model domain, the supraglacial debris layer will (1) increase in thickness from the base at a rate that is proportional to the sublimation rate and the concentration of englacial debris (with debris thickness increasing at a faster rate with higher concentrations of englacial debris and higher ablation rates), and (2) decrease in thickness at the surface via steady erosion. Further, if located within the rockfall runout zone
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>, the supraglacial debris layer will gain additional thickness from direct rockfall accumulation. This is represented as
