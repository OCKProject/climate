<p class="p">Before the model is used to estimate MB, it is executed for an 8-year spin-up period in order to better tune subsurface temperatures to the model scenario. During the spin-up period, the model is driven with the meteorological parameters (concatenation of the 2-year data set) that will be used in the model scenario.</p>
