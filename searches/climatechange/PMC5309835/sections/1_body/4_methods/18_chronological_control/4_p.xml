<p class="p">The large range in the above estimates is due to computing the surface age based on either (1) dividing the measured horizontal distance by the mean velocity of the entire region of interest or (2) integrating the measured surface ice-flow velocities at specific points along the glacier (smoothed with a moving average filter of 50 m) (see ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>). Both approaches are vulnerable to the assumption that modern flow velocity is a reasonable indicator of paleo-flow velocities (that is, that accumulation rate and environmental conditions have remained roughly constant) and that ice flow has been continuous over the time period of interest. Flow velocity was likely subtly different over the changing climate and mass balance regimes of the past ∼250 ka (due to ice hardness dependency on temperature; flow dependency on longitudinal stress of increased/decreased accumulation and so on.). Although the impact of past variations in flow velocity are difficult to predict, these age estimates are in accord with the high confidence cosmogenic-nuclide age tie points and are consistent with the proposed a ∼41 ka pulse cycle of IDL development.
