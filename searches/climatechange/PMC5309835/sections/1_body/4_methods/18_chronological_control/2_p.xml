<p class="p">As discussed in detail in Mackay and Marchant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>, establishing tight chronological control derived from cosmogenic-nuclide exposure dates on surface clasts above buried glacier ice is non-trivial, with uncertainty arising from a host of pre- and post-depositional processes that may affect the nuclide inventory of individual samples. However, we place a high confidence on the cosmogenic-nuclide-derived age of (1) ASD 6 on Mullins Glacier (210–230 ka), which is based on the close spatial correlation of three separate samples, and (2) ASD 1 (∼12 ka), because the probability of erroneous ages decreases dramatically with decreased distance from the headwall
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. We therefore use these dates as our high-confidence cosmogenic tie points. The dates and locations of additional samples
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> fall between these two tie points and are consistent with our inferred chronology (see
