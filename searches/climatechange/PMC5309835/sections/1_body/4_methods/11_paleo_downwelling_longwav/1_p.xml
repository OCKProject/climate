<p class="p">Downwelling longwave radiation (
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓) is a function of the integrated temperature of the atmospheric column and its effective emissivity. We estimate paleo values of 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓
 <sub class="sub">ydh</sub> for our model by directly adjusting our modern measured 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓
 <sub class="sub">0dh</sub> based on changes in temperature, 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">ydh</italic>
 </sub>. To do this, we adopt the Brutsaert
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref> parameterization using coefficients optimized to our location (derived from computing a best fit to our measured data through the minimization of the summed square of residuals adjusting the weight of outliers with bisquare weights), determine the difference in the predicted 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓ between modern conditions and a prescribed paleo atmospheric condition, and then adjust our measured 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓
 <sub class="sub">0
  <italic class="italic">dh</italic>
 </sub> by this amount to arrive at 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>↓
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">ydh</italic>
