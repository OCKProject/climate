<p class="p">We implemented a surface energy balance model (EBM) using source code derived from the open-source DEBAM of Hock and Holmgren
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> and Reijmer and Hock
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref> designed specifically for glaciated environments. Below, we give a brief overview of the EBM approach within DEBAM and highlight DEBAM customizations and routines specific to our implementation. We did not execute the EBM in a spatially distributed manner, but instead utilized its routines to investigate point mass balances.
