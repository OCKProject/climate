 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75" class="xref">75</xref>. Following the calculation of an initial temperature profile, the melt/refreezing amounts—if any—within each snow layer are calculated according to the temperature and water content of the layer. If water is present in the system (from surface or internal melt) it is allowed to percolate downward through snow layers at a rate that is controlled by an irreducible water content computed according to ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76" class="xref">76</xref> as a function of snow density. The surface skin temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">s</sub>) is determined from a linear interpolation of temperatures of the uppermost two layers. To maintain stability within the overall EBM, the multi-layer ice/snow temperature and density model is executed at a time step of 1/100 of the main execution time step as determined by the temporal resolution of the meteorological input data (1 h). Vertical layers are added to the model as snow accumulates via precipitation and are removed as a function of modelled ablation.
