 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> at each time step. Under highly stable atmospheric conditions and/or wind speeds below the minimum anemometer threshold, the stability length scale was set to 0.3 to maintain model stability. Both downward and upward energy and mass fluctuations (sublimation/resublimation) are tracked for each time step. The required roughness lengths for temperature (
