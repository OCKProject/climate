 </sub>), we assume that the total annual precipitation (including atmospheric precipitation and wind-blown snow) at the headwall of Mullins and Friedman glaciers is linearly related to the average annual net ice accumulation rate at TD (in water equivalent). Implicit in this approximation are the assumptions that (1) net accumulation at TD is directly proportional to precipitation at TD (that is, there is negligible variation in ablation at TD), and (2) that fluctuations in precipitation at TD co-vary with precipitation (including wind-blown snow) at our nearby study site. We preserve the timing and duration of our measured snowfall events and alter only their magnitude (that is, total precipitation per precipitation event) such that the precipitation is adjusted with the function.
