 <sub class="sub">0a</sub>, we made the following omissions. Only data for which the wind speed at the lowest anemometer was &gt;2.5 m s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> are included. This segregation was done to minimize the potential errors associated with the thermal instability of the atmosphere, and to use only data for wind speeds at which mechanical turbulence exceeded buoyancy effects

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>. Measurements were also discarded if: (1) zero wind speeds were recorded by any anemometer, (2) inverted wind speeds were recorded (higher anemometer recording a lower velocity than a lower anemometer) or (3) wind speeds at the highest anemometer were &lt;3 m s
