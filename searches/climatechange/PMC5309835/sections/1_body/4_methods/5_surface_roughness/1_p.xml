 <sub class="sub">0a</sub> typically reported for ablating glacier ice and snow areas (see review in ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>, Table 2), but there are two likely reasons for this. First, surface debris (length scales of ∼0.1–1 m) is present in the general vicinity of AWS01 on Mullins glacier. Second, due to a lack of co-located temperature profile measurements with our wind-profile measurements, we are unable to apply corrections for atmospheric stability in our 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">0a</italic>
 </sub> estimate and have thus implicitly assumed neutral stability during the measurement period. This assumption requires that our mean 
 <italic class="italic">z</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">0a</italic>
 </sub> estimate should be considered a maximum estimate due to the likelihood that conditions were skewed toward atmospheric boundary layer stability (the typical condition for glaciated regions in the summer) during our measurement period.
