<p class="p">These results highlight the sensitivity of cold-based debris-covered alpine glaciers to obliquity forcing in a region where ∼100 ka forcing dominates most other Pleistocene climate archives

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Although several environmental factors influence mass balance history (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4d</xref>), we demonstrate that for Mullins and Friedman glaciers the forcing from obliquity-paced changes in solar insolation, perhaps exacerbated by high atmospheric transmissivity of the region
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, is sufficient to cause non-linear geomorphic responses that result in the formation of repetitive IDL and ASD. The influence of air temperature, precipitation and solar insolation are all manifest in the modelled mass balance history (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4d</xref>), but these environmental factors amplify/weaken in complex ways: insolation serves to amplify the effect of temperature forcing so that when combined with changes in precipitation, it imparts a non-linear response in ablation that is paced at the obliquity timescale.
