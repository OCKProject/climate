<p class="p">Finally, our conclusion that highlights the importance of integrated summer energy in high-latitude glacial dynamics may also have implications for the dynamics of nearby blue ice areas in Antarctica

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>, and possibly even for postulated debris-covered glaciers on Mars. For the latter, imagery from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>; many such features also show arcuate surface ridges in ice-ablation areas reminiscent of ASDs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46" class="xref">46</xref>. If correct, then it suggests the tantalizing notion that climate signals may be recorded in the surface topography and englacial structure of cold-based, debris-covered glaciers on Mars

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49" class="xref">49</xref>, and that the distribution of relatively clean glacier ice and debris-rich ice in these systems may likewise be resolved
