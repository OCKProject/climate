<p class="p">We next reconstruct broad changes in mass balance—and associated IDL formation periods—in the critical zones of Mullins and Friedman glaciers during late Pleistocene time. To accomplish this, we repeat our modelling exercise but this time use proxy data (inferred precipitation and temperature) from nearby Taylor Dome (&lt;40 km distant)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> and reconstructed high-latitude insolation forcing from Berger and Loutre
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. These data are combined with our measured micrometeorological data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>) to produce synthetic meteorological input representative of specific paleo-environmental climate conditions (see ‘Methods' section). The modelling results show a distinct ∼41 ka periodicity for mass balance change in glacier critical zones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), even though proxy records for precipitation and temperature at Taylor Dome show a relatively weak response to this ∼41-ka forcing. This implies that mass-balance loss and IDL formation over this time period includes complex feedback mechanisms and is paced most strongly by total summer energy (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>, rather than peak summer insolation, atmospheric temperature or precipitation changes alone (
