<p class="p">A chronology for Mullins Glacier, based on cosmogenic-nuclide exposure ages of surface clasts and the integration of modern, horizontal ice-surface flow velocities for both Mullins and Friedman glaciers

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref> (see ‘Methods' section) is in accord with obliquity-paced mass balance changes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). These data, when combined with the morphological consistencies among both glaciers, and the mass balance modelling results, show that the observed IDLs and corresponding ASDs are Pleistocene in age, ranging from ∼12 ka BP for IDL 1 and ASD 1 near valley heads to ∼210–230 ka BP for IDL 6 and ASD 6 several kilometres down valley (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figs 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">4</xref>). As a partial test of the obliquity-paced IDL formation model, we coupled resolved changes in mass balance with a model for the development of supraglacial debris in the critical zone. Results from this modelling exercise show that each major peak in negative mass balance is capable of producing the requisite thickness of debris layers in the critical zone that is consistent with estimated IDL thickness from GPR and ice core data (
