<p class="p">Located at similar elevations and &lt;∼2 km apart, Mullins and Friedman glaciers share identical hyper-arid polar-desert climate conditions, including summer average temperatures and relative humidity in their ice ablation zones (−14 °C and 53%, respectively

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>, see ‘Methods' section)). Modern precipitation rates (including atmospheric deposition and wind-transported snow) are poorly constrained over these glaciers, but likely fall within the range of ∼4–10 cm a

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). Each glacier includes a small ice-accumulation zone, dotted in places with isolated gravel-, cobble-, and boulder-sized clasts, that grades down valley into an increasingly thick (0.1–0.5 m) layer of surface debris that mantles buried glacier ice in the ablation zone with sharp, dry contacts. The debris is sourced exclusively from rockfall off bedrock cliffs at valley headwalls

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>; rocks that fall on ice-accumulation zones are subsequently buried and transported down valley—as englacial debris—before rising upward toward the ice surface as overlying ice sublimes; rocks that land within ice-ablation zones travel only as supraglacial debris. Both glaciers are cold-based and frozen to their bed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>; all down valley ice flow is accommodated by internal deformation, rather than by basal slip, and basal entrainment is either completely absent
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> or limited to a negligible amount of fine-grained material near the base and terminus of the glacier
