<p class="p">The antiquity of debris-covered alpine glaciers in polar deserts is due largely to a dynamic balance between (1) mass wasting and snow accumulation at headwall cliffs and (2) exceedingly slow rates of ice loss beneath protective supraglacial debris
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. These conditions impart unusual ice dynamics that critically differentiate debris-covered alpine glaciers from typical (non-debris-covered) glaciers. Namely, ablation rates in debris-covered glaciers are highest near glacier heads, rather than at low-elevation glacial termini
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>; as a result, glacier sensitivity to environmental change is greatest in ice-accumulation and uppermost ablation zones, which lack protective overburden

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Given this unusual scenario, we refer to the spatial area incorporating the ice-accumulation and uppermost ablation zones on debris-covered glaciers as the glacier critical zone (
