<p class="p">What process might drive similar changes in mass balance in the glacier critical zones of both Mullins and Friedman glaciers? To address this question, we use a numerical energy balance model (EBM) for point mass balance (accumulation – ablation) as input to our conceptual model for the formation of rocky surface lags in critical zones of debris-covered glaciers (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref> is first tuned to modern conditions and validated with high-temporal resolution micrometeorological measurements and local observational data (see ‘Methods' section). Next, individual components of the measured micrometeorological input data are adjusted systematically to test the modelled mass balance response to various forcing conditions. Through this modelling exercise, we evaluate the climate sensitivity of glacier critical zones and, by extension, the formation of IDL, under conditions of altered temperature, precipitation, solar intensity and summer duration. The results show that mass balance changes (positive verses negative) and resulting IDL production/cessation is possible with minor perturbations in atmospheric temperature, precipitation and/or solar forcing (
