 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> these IDL are thought to reflect recurrent environmental change in glacier critical zones. Expanding on this proposition, Mackay, Marchant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> argued that observed patterns of clean glacier ice interspersed with layers of englacial rocky debris most likely reflect alternating changes in net ice accumulation and ice ablation, with possible implications for rates of rockfall delivery to glacier critical zones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c,d</xref>). If correct, IDL originate during times of net ice ablation, when persistent low-magnitude rockfall and/or sublimation of ice containing scattered debris (âˆ¼1%) produce a surface lag of rocks and sediment in critical zones that ultimately slows the loss of subjacent ice. During renewed net ice accumulation, these rocky lags are buried by snow and ice, deform and flow englacially down valley (through plastic deformation of surrounding glacier ice, for example, refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref> implicates regional climate change as the fundamental driver in their formation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. Specifically, the repetitive pattern of six IDL/ASD on both Mullins and Friedman glaciers highlight six periods of negative mass balance (increased ablation and/or decreased accumulation) separated by five periods of increased mass balance (decreased ablation and/or increased accumulation).
