<p class="p">Twenty-four kilometres of overlapping and multiple-frequency ground-penetrating radar (GPR) transects, 21 shallow ice cores, and &gt;40 near-surface ice excavations on Mullins and Friedman glaciers were collected and analysed by Mackay, Marchant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>; the data reveal a near-identical pattern of six inclined bands of concentrated rocks and sediment in Mullins and Friedman glaciers (Inclined Debris Layers, IDLs, ∼10–35% debris by volume) separated by clean glacier ice (&lt;∼1% debris by volume)

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 2,3</xref>). Each IDL in Mullins and Friedman glaciers rests several metres above their respective glacier beds and slopes upward to intersect buried ice surfaces at corresponding arcuate topographic ridges (arcuate surface discontinuities, ASD)
