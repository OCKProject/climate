Using a numerical model of glacial mass balance, we explore the sensitivity of these glaciers to the range of climate forcing experienced in the region over the past ∼250 ka. These results are combined with morphological observations, chronological constraints and a geomorphic model for debris entrainment to detect tractable links between past climate change and preserved glacier structure.
