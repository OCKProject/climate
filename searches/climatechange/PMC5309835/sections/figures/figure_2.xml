   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Conceptual model for the formation of ASD/IDL in the critical zone. During conditions favourable for net ice accumulation (
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>=1), the glacier maintains exposed ice in the upper ablation area and surface debris gradually thickens down valley. When conditions shift to net ablation (
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>=2), significant ice loss occurs near the valley headwall (unprotected ice, glacier critical zone, see text), but minimal ice loss occurs beneath thick debris down valley. As ice loss progresses, a spoon-shaped hollow may form near the headwall that is ultimately capped by a lag of debris; this capping debris develops through the continued emplacement of rocks via rockfall and from the accumulation of scattered englacial debris that is brought to the ice surface as overlying ice sublimes. When the conditions shift to net ice accumulation (
   <italic class="italic">t</italic>=3), the rocky surface lag and spoon-shaped hollow are in-filled and buried with snow and glacier ice (even with horizontal ice flow); this buried rocky layer becomes an IDL that deforms and moves down valley with glacier flow. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Upon multiple repetitions, a series of IDL are preserved marking successive climate transitions. Each IDL manifests at the glacier surface as an ASD.
