  <p class="p">(
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Hillshade relief map of Mullins Glacier from airborne LiDAR (2 m resolution) showing ASD. Chronological tie points for ASD 1 and ASD 6 are derived from cosmogenic-exposure dating of surface clasts as reported in ref. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Additional age control for Mullins Glacier inferred from integrating the modern surface flow velocity
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref> (smoothed with a 400 m running average) (black line) as a function of distance down valley. The grey dashed lines represent the conservative bounds on this age estimate, computed using the mean velocity and the instantaneous surface velocity
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Inferred ages correspond well with tie points derived from cosmogenic-exposure age studies; red horizontal lines show modelled ages and age scatter in cosmogenic data at those sites
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The modelled output for the onset and development (thickening) of supraglacial debris over the past 250 ka in the critical zone (at L02) that ultimately produces inclined debris layers (IDLs)/ASDs; curved bars reflect the non-linear reduction in the rate of debris development over time, which arises because thicker debris slows underlying ice sublimation; the width of the bars refers to the duration of modelled negative mass balance; modelled thicknesses match well with observed thicknesses seen in hand-dug exposures and ground-penetrating radar. The numbers correspond to the ASD/IDL number. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Modelled point mass balance in the critical zone (L02) over the past 250 ka; red shading highlights negative mass balance corresponding with modelled development of supraglacial debris in the critical zone. (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) Integrated summer energy
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref> using a threshold of 250W  m
   <sup class="sup">−2</sup>. (
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) Temperature departure from modern conditions as recorded in the Taylor Dome core
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Marine isotope stages are labelled for reference. (
   <bold class="bold">g</bold>) Annual accumulation rate at Taylor Dome
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>; data in 
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">g</bold> are used to produce paleo precipitation and temperature data for Mullins and Friedman glaciers (see ‘Methods' section). (
   <bold class="bold">h</bold>) For reference, temperature departure from modern conditions recorded in the Vostok ice core
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. The results show that modelled ASD/IDL growth is correlated with peaks in integrated summer energy; this occurs when solar insolation forcing amplifies the weaker obliquity-paced atmospheric temperature forcing.
