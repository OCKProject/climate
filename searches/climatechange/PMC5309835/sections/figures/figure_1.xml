Automatic weather stations (AWS 1–4) and model locations/data points (L01 and L02) (see 'Methods' section) are marked. The critical zone for both glaciers is outlined with a red dashed line. The grey lines within the critical zones mark the inferred approximate equilibrium lines. The yellow line near the central flow line of each glacier marks the location of the GPR transect used for the subsurface interpretation shown in
