 </sup>, and we recommend that planners apply one or more of the approaches we describe to ensure climate adaptation plans are robust to the uncertainty of future climate change impacts. Conceptual frameworks such as the one used here serve as a heuristic for considering conservation challenges in the face of climate change, but care must be taken not to oversimplify such challenges when mapping climate predictions to inform recommendations.
