The climate variables used were mean annual temperature (°C), mean temperature of the warmest month (MWMT, °C), mean temperature of the coldest month (MCMT, °C), difference between MCMT and MWMT (°C), mean annual precipitation (mm), mean summer (May to Sep) precipitation (mm), mean winter (Oct to Apr) precipitation (mm), degree-days above 5 °C (growing degree days), the number of frost-free days, Hargreave’s reference evaporation, and Hargreave’s climatic moisture index

 </sup>). These variables were transformed to meet assumptions of normality (log transform of precipitation and moisture index and square-root transform of degree days) and then subjected to a principal components analysis using a correlation matrix approach to reduce the dimensionality of the data. The first two principal component (PC) scores accounted for 89% of the variance in the multivariate climate space, with the PC1 and PC2 axes accounting for 66% and 23% of variance, respectively. PC1 was most strongly associated with temperature variables, and PC2 was most strongly associated with precipitation and moisture variables.
