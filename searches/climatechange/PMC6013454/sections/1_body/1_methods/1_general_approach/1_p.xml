<p id="Par7" class="p">We relied on data available from the AdaptWest project, which is a collaborative effort to disseminate spatial data on predicted changes in climate to aid conservation planners (see adaptwest.databasin.org). We used 1-km resolution climate data from AdaptWest

 </sup> to derive three metrics of climate change exposure at one time step (30-year average centered on 2055). Specifically, we mapped estimates of (1) forward climate velocity, (2) backward climate velocity, and (3) local climate dissimilarity. These metrics have been used in previous studies to evaluate general measures of exposure not focused on any specific species or ecosystem, as is the case of our study

 </sup>. For our analysis, we focused on multivariate metrics derived from the same data reduction method (principal components analysis) to emphasize variability derived from alternative climate projections, and not from other methodological decisions (i.e., which variables and approach to use to reduce data dimensionality). We also limited our analysis to one time step (predictions centered on the year 2055) to (1) reduce the complexity of our analysis, (2) focus on alternative predictions holding time constant, and (3) present results for a future timeframe likely to influence land management decisions.
