 </sup> into four quartiles and combined these quartiles with quartiles of climate vulnerability estimates described above. This resulted in a 4 × 4 classification of conservation value and climate vulnerability (based on exposure). We assess regions for assignment of conservation strategies with the highest levels of agreement among alternative climate projections by visually inspecting maps (
