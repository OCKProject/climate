<p id="Par18" class="p">We focused our attention on locations classified into the highest and lowest quartiles for both conservation value and climate vulnerability (i.e., corners of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The resulting bivariate maps show locations with high conservation value-low climate vulnerability; low conservation value-low climate vulnerability; low conservation value-high climate vulnerability; or high conservation value-high climate vulnerability. These are the lands where our confidence in assigning a conservation strategy based on values and vulnerability – per the heuristic framework – may be the highest when agreement in climate predictions is high. Specifically, we focus on these areas to remove sources of uncertainty associated with intermediate degrees of values and vulnerability. To assess confidence in the assignment of conservation recommendations, we mapped the level of agreement (i.e., number of times a cell was placed in the focal corner representing a conservation recommendation) and then calculated the land area for each level of agreement. This allowed us to evaluate how the total area of the classified value and vulnerability combinations (i.e., the “corners” of the heuristic framework and maps) change as the standard for “agreement” is raised from minimum majority (frequency ≥ 5 simulations) to full consensus (by mapping only grid cells assigned to the quartile mode for all 18 simulations, i.e., frequency = 18 simulations).
