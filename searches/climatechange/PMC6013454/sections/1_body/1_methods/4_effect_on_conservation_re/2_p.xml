<p id="Par16" class="p">To evaluate how the level of agreement among climate projections and metrics influence confidence in assigning conservation strategies, we created bivariate maps using the quartile mode of each climate metric with a map of wildland conservation value as in Belote

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> classify lands as either (1) high conservation value-high climate vulnerability, (2) high conservation value-low climate vulnerability, (3) low conservation value-low climate vulnerability, or (4) low conservation value-high climate vulnerability (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Such classification makes it possible to identify different conservation strategies, ranging from an emphasis on traditional reserve protection in high value-low vulnerability lands, to restoration to historical conditions in low value-low vulnerability locations, to innovative approaches that anticipate and manage for the future in low value-high vulnerability areas
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. High value-high vulnerability areas represent challenging scenarios, whereby protection of conservation values is a priority, but expanded management flexibility may be required to allow interventions under a high degree of climate exposure (see
