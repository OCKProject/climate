<p id="Par13" class="p">We mapped agreement in climate predictions among the 18 different alternatives for each multivariate metric of climate exposure separately (Supplemental Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). To do this, we classified the climate metric values for all 1-km grid cells into four quartiles and assigned each quartile an integer value of 1 (lower quartile) to 4 (upper quartile). This quartile assignment was done separately for each of the 18 simulations (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). Then, for each grid cell, we identified which quartile value was most frequently assigned to each grid cell (i.e., the mode) and the number of times the mode was recorded for each location (i.e., frequency of the mode) (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). The frequency of mode hence serves as an index of model agreement and uncertainty, with values ranging from 5 (minimum majority and little agreement among simulations) to 18 (perfect consensus). Other means to assess uncertainty include calculating the median and the standard deviation of estimates for all grid cell locations. We also calculated these values (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>), but here focus on the mode, because maps derived from the heuristic framework of Belote

 </sup> require classifying locations by their relative climate vulnerability. By calculating the mode of classified quartiles and the associated frequencies, we could more easily evaluate agreement in simulation predictions in the context of the value and vulnerability maps by which conservation strategies are recommended, compared to assessing variance among simulations.
