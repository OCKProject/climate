 </sup>; (Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>) use variability among climate projections to discount estimates of climate exposure. In Supplemental Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>, we present the discounted mean for each exposure metric using the standard deviation of estimates among alternative projections. Use of the standard deviation represents an alternative for explicitly accounting for variability among climate change projections. We recommend use of discounted metrics of exposure where variability among alternative climate projections are available.
