<p id="Par33" class="p">Given our results and other considerations mentioned above, we offer four primary recommendations. First, decision-makers could use our approach to understand the central tendency of climate exposure metrics while explicitly evaluating confidence based our assessment of the frequency of assigning areas to high or low climate exposure. We provide an extension to the framework proposed by Belote

 </sup> that incorporates uncertainty in climate predictions. Specifically, we recommend adjusting recommendations based on the level of certainty of climate exposure predictions (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). However, confidence in decision making given levels of agreement in predictions of climate exposure will vary with the perceived or actual risks of management actions or inactions for various ecological conditions
