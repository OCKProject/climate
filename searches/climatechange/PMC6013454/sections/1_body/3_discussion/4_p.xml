<p id="Par26" class="p">Our results provide insights for assigning conservation strategies based on projected future climate exposure. For example, conservation strategies aimed at anticipating climate and using innovative techniques (upper left corner of the conceptual framework; dark red mapped areas) may be more confidently applied to various lands located in the upper Midwest where the frequency in agreement of climate projections is relatively high ( ≥ 16 of 18, or ~89% of projections), at least for velocity metrics. These lands experience a high degree of human modification

 </sup>, and restoration of lands within the matrix of agricultural lands may provide opportunities to emphasize innovative activities that anticipate the relatively high degree of climate exposure. While many of these lands are privately held, the return on the investment for conservation of species may be relatively high
