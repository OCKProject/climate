 </sup>. Lack of alignment between these three metrics of climate exposure does not represent uncertainty per se, because the metrics are designed to measure different aspects of climate exposure. In fact, species and ecosystems of an area may experience different types of climate vulnerability based on different exposure metrics resulting in diverse responses to expected changes in climate
