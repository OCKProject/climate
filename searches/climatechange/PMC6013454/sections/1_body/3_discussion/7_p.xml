<p id="Par29" class="p">While several regions included lands frequently classified into the same bivariate value-vulnerability categories from the heuristic, full consensus among alternative climate projections was rare. Confidence in assignment of conservation strategies must take into account uncertainty and other important considerations. First, the different GCMs evaluated here represent alternative projections

 </sup>. Our method of pooling GCM predictions does not consider the relative strengths of the GCMs in different regions. Second, the conservation values and climate vulnerability conceptual figure provides a heuristic framework to consider climate adaptation options. However, mapping areas based on this two-dimensional framework requires binning climate data to create classified bivariate value-vulnerability maps. Therefore, geographic regions of low climate exposure, for example, are based on values relative only to the distribution of data and the spatial scale represented. Thus, even lands of lower relative climate exposure may experience a high degree of change resulting in species- and ecosystem-altering effects that might require adjustments in conservation actions
