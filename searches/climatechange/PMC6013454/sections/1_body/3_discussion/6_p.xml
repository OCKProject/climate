<p id="Par28" class="p">The dryland regions of southeastern Oregon, northern Nevada, and parts of southern Idaho all represent high value-high vulnerability lands with at least some areas from each metric receiving a relatively high level of agreement among models (upper right region of the conceptual heuristic; blue mapped areas). These lands are relatively remote, located between protected areas, and composed of ecosystems under-represented in existing conservation reserves

 </sup>. The relatively high degree of climate exposure expected in these areas presents conservation challenges. Calls to intervene through land management directed at facilitating ecosystem change in areas of high climate vulnerability are often countered by recommendations to protect climate vulnerable ecosystems

 </sup>. Finding the best strategy to sustain biological diversity into the future in high value â€“ high vulnerability lands is difficult. In these places, we recommend applying a range of conservation strategies that will spread risk and facilitate experimentation intended to maintain biodiversity and ecological processes into the future

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>
 </sup>. These strategies may range from maintaining or restoring conditions, managing for anticipating future conditions, and maintaining landscapes as untreated controls applied as experimental treatments
