<p id="Par30" class="p">Using binned quartiles of climate exposure estimates may conceal areas of agreement where predictions among different GCMs agree in the overall

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref>). Summaries for the three multivariate exposure metrics are also reported to provide ranges of values for each metric. Ecoregions were used in these summaries to simplify climate predictions among defined geographic regions. These summaries of climate metric predictions among regions provide insights into the central tendency of magnitude and direction of climate predictions while representing the variability among simulation alternatives. For example, and not surprisingly, all projections predict an increase in temperatures of varying magnitudes, while precipitation is more variable. Some regions and models are expected to experience increases or decreases in precipitation. However, even in regions where precipitation is expected to increase, rising temperatures are predicted to increase estimates of moisture deficit. Evaluating the direction and magnitude of individual climate variables may provide important insights into sources of uncertainty among climate simulation predictions. It would be useful if such evaluations of individual climate variables accompanied work describing synthetic climate exposure metrics, such as those based on multivariate data reduction methods.
