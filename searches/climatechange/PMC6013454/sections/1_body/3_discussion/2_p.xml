<p id="Par24" class="p">Areas where all three metrics (forward velocity, backward velocity, and climate dissimilarity) are either low or high were limited to small portions of the country, though at least two of the three metrics did align over relatively large areas. Mountainous regions throughout the West, for example, were characterized by low degrees of exposure in at least two metrics. These patterns are explained by similarities in the two velocity metrics, which are partially driven by topography. Future climate analogues may be in close geographic proximity to existing climate conditions in mountainous regions where steep elevation-driven climate gradients exist

 </sup>. In contrast, areas in the upper Midwest and Great Basin regions were characterized by a high degree of predicted climate exposure for at least two of the three metrics. These areas with gentler topography or with greater predicted shifts in climate variables may be more vulnerable to greater ecological shifts (but see
