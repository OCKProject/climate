<p id="Par20" class="p">The upper Midwestern states were characterized by relatively high degree of climate exposure, whereas mountainous regions of the West and Appalachians were characterized by low forward and backward velocity with relatively high agreement among simulations. All three climate metrics result in low predicted exposure occurring in the coastal range of California, northern and central Arizona, and west Texas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The upper quartile of all three climate metrics occurred in the upper Midwest and deserts and arid regions in the intermountain West. Areas where two of the three metrics agreed in relatively low or high predictions of exposure were common. Western mountains, the Appalachians, and much the coastal plain of the southeast were characterized by low exposure for at least 2 metrics. The Basin and Range of the West, the upper Midwest, and parts of the Gulf Coast were characterized by high exposure estimates in at least 2 metrics. Grid cells with full consensus among metrics classified into the lower quartile mode made up only 2.6% of the contiguous U.S. (dark blue areas in the upper map of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and grid cells with consensus in the upper quartile simulation made up 2.5% area (black areas in the lower map of Fig.
