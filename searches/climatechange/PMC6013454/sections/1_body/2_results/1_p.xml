<p id="Par19" class="p">Patterns of climate vulnerability based on the three metrics (forward velocity, backward velocity, and climate dissimilarity) varied throughout the country, as did the level of agreement among climate simulations for each metric (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For all three metrics, agreement in quartile mode classification was highest in the lower and upper quartiles; less agreement was observed in the middle quartiles. Velocity metrics tended to have higher agreement among projections than did estimates of climate dissimilarity based on frequency of quartile mode (see maps and histograms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, 82% and 80% of the total area was classified as the same quartile mode for forward and backward velocity in ≥10 of 18 projections, respectively, versus 60% of the total area that was classified as the same quartile mode in ≥10 simulations of the dissimilarity estimate (see histograms in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Similarly, 20% and 21% of the total area was classified as the same mode in ≥16 of 18 projections, whereas only 6% was classified as the same mode of dissimilarity. Full consensus among all 18 simulations occurred in 7%, 8%, and 2% of the U.S. based on quartile modes for estimates of forward velocity, backward velocity, and dissimilarity, respectively.
