<p id="Par21" class="p">Variability in metrics resulted in different classification of vulnerability in the bivariate framework and maps (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), although some broad patterns of similarity are evident in the maps. Land classified as low conservation value and low climate vulnerability was consistently less abundant than the other classifications among the three metrics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Among the three metrics, lands classified as either low value-high vulnerability or high value-low vulnerability represented on average 36% and 37% of all lands, respectively.
