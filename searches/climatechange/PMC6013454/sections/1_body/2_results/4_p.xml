<p id="Par22" class="p">Setting increasingly high standards for model consensus resulted in decreasing areas where climate-informed conservation strategies could be confidently recommended (FigsÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). At the lowest threshold (5 out of 18 projections agree), large portions of the upper Midwestern states were classified as low value, high vulnerability for all three metrics. Similarly, many southwestern and western mountains were classified as high value, low vulnerability under all three metrics. As the standard of agreement was raised to 16, however, the area of agreement dropped markedly. Only metrics of velocity produced a high level of agreement for larger areas in the high value-low vulnerability classification, mainly in the mountainous regions of the West and in the Southern Appalachians. In contrast, climate dissimilarity showed high agreement only in Florida and central Texas.
