<p id="Par3" class="p">Faced with these challenges, climate adaptation heuristics to support conservation decisions have been developed using assessments of existing ecological conditions while considering the predicted or observed impacts of climate change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, evaluation of predicted climate change impacts may result in land managers adjusting restoration strategies for areas with degraded ecological conditions. The historical range of variability may serve as an insufficient target for restoration when considering potential climate change impacts

Whether protected areas may require intensive management intervention, novel management options, or additional flexibility in a climate-altered future remains controversial, especially in relatively intact wildland ecosystems
