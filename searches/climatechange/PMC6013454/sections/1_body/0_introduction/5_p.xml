<p id="Par6" class="p">Our goal is to evaluate how confidence in conservation recommendations may vary when considering uncertainty in climate projections and variability in metrics of climate exposure, using the contiguous United States as a case study. We used a heuristic framework that recommends conservation strategies based on combinations of existing conservation value and projected climate vulnerability (Fig.Â

 </sup>). To explicitly assess sources of uncertainty and their potential effects on confidence in conservation recommendations, we evaluated variability and agreement in predictions among general circulation models and greenhouse gas concentration scenarios, as well as different climate exposure metrics. We assumed that confidence in conservation recommendations increases with the agreement among climate scenarios and climate exposure metrics. Our specific objectives were to (1) map three multivariate metrics of climate exposure (forward climate velocity, backward climate velocity, and local climate dissimilarity); (2) map agreement among alternative climate projections for each of the three metrics of exposure; and (3) assess how agreement in climate projections influence confidence in assigning climate adaptation conservation strategies.
