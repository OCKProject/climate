<p class="p">Studies were selected based on their adherence to these search criteria, and were evaluated based on the strength of their findings and the risk of bias present in each study. We examined each research article for the following criteria: population of exposure, nature of exposure, measured outcome, study type, location, and possible sources of bias. In exposure, we reviewed method of temperature measurement, duration of heat events, and nature of temperature exposure. For each type of outcome, we collected statistical findings where provided. Inclusion of air pollution and socioeconomic variables were included in the final analysis of the study. In the event that a study was deemed to have high risk of bias, it would be removed from the literature review; however, no studies were deemed to have inappropriate risk of bias. </p>
