<p class="p">In January, 2017, we conducted a systematic review of the literature, following the Populations of interest, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) Statement model. We investigated impacts of climate change processes on maternal, fetal, and neonatal health by targeting publications in the PubMed database (6450 results) and Cochrane Review (0 results). As the original search in PubMed returned a comprehensive number of articles, no searches in additional database were deemed necessary. Our search included the following terms: human AND temperature (OR ambient temperature OR hot temperature OR heat wave OR climate change) AND pregnancy (OR pregnancy outcome OR birth weight OR preterm birth OR gestational age OR stillbirth). Papers were included on the basis of pertaining to maternal health, reproductive health, birth outcomes, child health, and climate change processes. We focused on maternal, fetal and child populations, with the given exposure of atypical climatic processes. The primary exposure and climate change topic of interest was heat and heat waves. The outcome of interest was a notable change in health outcome for any one of these populations. Papers were excluded if they did not examine human populations. Papers that focused on specific disease processes, such as the vertical transmission of viruses in pregnant women, the indoor ambient environment, or maternal and fetal outcomes unrelated to climate change or temperature were excluded. </p>
