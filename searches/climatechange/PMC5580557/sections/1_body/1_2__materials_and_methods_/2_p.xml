<p class="p">We examined each research article for the following criteria: population of exposure, nature of exposure, measured outcome, study type, location, and possible sources of bias. In exposure, we noted data on temperature measurements, duration of heat events, and severity of temperature exposure. For each type of outcome, we collected statistical outcomes, confidence intervals, and risk estimates, when provided. Confounding or mitigating factors, such as air pollution and socioeconomic variables, were also collected. Each article was examined for the possibility of bias, including selection bias, misclassification bias, detection bias, internal validity. Definitions for preterm birth, early birth, lower birth weight, and still-birth were used according to established literature. The World Health Organization defines preterm birth as occurring at less than 37 weeks of gestational age, and low birth weight as birth weight of less than 2500 g [
