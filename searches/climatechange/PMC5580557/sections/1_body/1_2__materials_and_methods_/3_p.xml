<p class="p">The study selection proceeded according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Of 6450 initially screened studies, 28 met final selection criteria for this review. All search results were exported to RefWorks. The papers were screened initially by title, contents of abstract, and then by contents of full text by one reviewer. The search terms returned both reviews and original research articles; reviews were excluded from this literature review. As such, the final selection of articles is a combination of literature retrieved from the initial search terms, from reviewing reference lists of selected articles and linked citations from newly published literature, though only 1 source was returned via hand selection (see
