<p class="p">We conduct a systematic review to identify how extreme heat, specifically effects maternal, fetal, and neonatal health. There have been a handful of systematic reviews on the influences of climate change and variety of birth outcomes [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This review is an update and focused assessment of preterm labor, birth weight, and stillbirth as a result of ambient temperature exposures in a rapidly developing field of research. Additionally, this review specifically addresses the failure of existing heat health recommendations to capture heat-related morbidity in fetuses and pregnant women. This allows us to advance recommendations for pregnant women in the face of climate change by addressing insufficient public health recommendations for those populations during extreme heat events.
