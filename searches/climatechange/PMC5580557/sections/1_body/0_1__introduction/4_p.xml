<p class="p">Pregnant women are susceptible to increasing ambient temperatures and heat waves since their ability to thermoregulate is compromised [

 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>], and are complex in both etiology and outcome. The sequelae of heat exposure on developing fetuses are not yet completely understood since the epidemiology behind many adverse fetal outcomes, including preterm delivery, is diverse [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Low birth weight was previously hypothesized as a consequence of sustained heat exposure and maternal heat stress [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. While there is not conclusive evidence at this point, there may be a connection between adverse birth events and extreme deviation in ambient temperature.
