<p class="p">Finally, identifying the most effective strategies to prevent adverse outcomes would ideally rely on an improved understanding of the primary causes underlying adverse birth outcomes from heat. However, they are currently not well understood, as the etiologies of low birth weight and preterm birth are complex. There are a number of theories regarding this connection, such as increased maternal heat production [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>], increased weight gain, and the burden of the fetus overwhelming a pregnant woman's ability to tolerate heat stress, resulting in low birth weight. Increasing heat stress may cause uterine constriction, and dehydration may result in decreased uterine blood flow [

 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] argue that preterm birth and low birth weight outcomes must be considered separately due to the high correlation between preterm birth and low birthweight. Socioeconomic factors may further play a role, as psychological stress, social stress, and housing instability may further increase risk for preterm birth [
