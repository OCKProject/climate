<p class="p">Yet, air pollution has been correlated with all-cause mortality [

 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Levels of fine particulate matter (such as PM2.5) may increase in low and middle income countries (LMICs) as well as developing countries, serving to further exacerbate adverse fetal health risks [
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. Increasing air pollution levels appear to cause increased maternal stress [
 <xref rid="B56-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>] that is exacerbated in heat waves when pollutant concentrations rise [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], further impacting fetal stress. While most studies accounted for air pollution as a potential confounder, air pollution coupled with heat may directly impact both maternal health and birth outcomes [
 <xref rid="B37-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Therefore, strategies to address heat exposure for pregnant women should also reduce both the impact of extreme heat and air pollution through urban design and implementation of heat warning systems [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Greenspace should be expanded within urban areas, not only as it reduces the impacts of UHI, but since proximity to greenspace has additionally been linked to lower PM2.5 exposures in pregnant women [
 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>], and may reduce risk for adverse birth outcomes.
