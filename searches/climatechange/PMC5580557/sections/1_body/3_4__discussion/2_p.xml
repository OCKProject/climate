<p class="p">First, public health agencies should specify that their warnings apply to pregnant women. This is complicated by the lack of uniformity in defining a heat wave. The definition of a heatwave alters the amount of heat-related morbidity captured within an exposure period. Recent meta-analysis demonstrates that correlations between mortality and specific heat wave definitions vary by the temperature threshold and the duration of the event [
