<p class="p">When attempting to reduce heat-related illness through public health warnings, the timing of the heat wave should be taken into consideration. Heat events occurring earlier in the warm season cause an increase in adverse outcomes relative to comparable events occurring later. As such, the relative acclimatization of the population should be considered as an additional factor when generating heat warnings. Furthermore, these results may not appear initially, but rather as a lagged effect, with adverse outcomes appearing from immediately after exposure to as late as one month post exposure [
