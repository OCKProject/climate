<p class="p">While there has been significant progress on heat and birth research in the last five years, a number of limitations remain. We only included articles that are written in English. While this obviously offers an imbalanced representation of the literature, we do not believe it is a biased review since many studies in non-English speaking countries are still represented. Several studies report effect modification by socioeconomic factors, such as race, income, and profession [

 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]; these factors are not included in analysis universally in the data sets. Furthermore, there is a widespread lack of information regarding home air conditioning access, or other resources that serve as mitigating factors in heat exposure [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. These factors may serve as confounders within studies, bias findings towards the null, or cause discord in results among studies. The protective effect of extreme heat (99th percentile) on preterm birth observed by Liang et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] demonstrates that socioeconomic data and air conditioner use may impact preterm birth in Shenzhen, China differently from other cities in ways not yet quantified. However, this review of the literature is not a meta-analysis, and therefore cannot draw further statistical significance of heat impacts on birth outcomes beyond the findings of the original studies.
