<p class="p">There is limited evidence for critical heat-related window periods. Heat exposures may have immediate effects on birth outcomes, as well as delayed (lagged) or cumulative effects on birth outcomes. When specifically examining the last week of pregnancies with preterm deliveries, Basu et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] revealed the most significant increase of preterm risk six days prior to delivery, while exposure on the day prior to delivery also poses elevated risk; Kent et al. [
 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Exposure lag periods of up to several weeks were found to be significantly correlated with adverse outcomes. Vicedo-Cabrera et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] found a four-week lag in preterm births following extreme heat exposure. Dadvand et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] found decreased gestational age at birth to be associated with a lag interval of 5 days after heat exposure. The cumulative effect of temperature exposure must also be considered when addressing exposure intervals, such as in exposures occurring over consecutive days [
