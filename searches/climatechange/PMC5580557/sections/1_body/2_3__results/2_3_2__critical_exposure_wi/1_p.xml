Some studies in this review measure temperature exposure over the course of gestation while others examine temperatures in the short term, such as a week or month leading to delivery. Due to the variability in measured exposure windows, there is no consensus in critical window periods. Of studies that measure the full length of gestation, each trimester was separately identified as the primary window.
