<p class="p">There has been some question regarding which drives adverse outcomes more, the acute level of exposure or the duration of exposure. In this review, we see that surpassing a temperature threshold during a heat event may be the most critical component to adverse birth outcomes during an extreme heat event as noted in Wang et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. While the duration of a heat event was examined as a function of preterm birth hazard, the data show that surpassing historical temperature percentiles in each city resulted in an adverse birth outcome of some kind across all studies. The length of exposure varied from a one-day impact to cumulative exposures of consecutive days or days spread over the course of a month. Even with heterogeneity in exposure lengths, heat waves and increased ambient heat load were correlated with the prevalence or risk of adverse birth outcomes. Initial adverse birth outcomes may be triggered at a critical temperature threshold and subsequent cumulative heat exposure brought on by the duration of the event are likely associated with increasing morbidity in susceptible groups.
