<p class="p">There was diversity in strategies to measure ambient temperature exposure. The intensity of the exposure variable was different, as the length of time captured by each exposure measurement varied across studies. Ambient temperature deviation was measured primarily as a departure from the historical mean, serving as the 50th percentile within the data. Deviations were considered on the order of 75th, 90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles for heat. The subdivisions varied among studies (see Dadvand et al. [
