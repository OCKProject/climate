<p class="p">Heat waves were defined differently within studies, whether by established definitions of heat events or as relative measures of measured data to historical temperature averages. Heat waves and extreme heat events were classified according to the length of time, by threshold temperature, or a combination therein (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00853-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). This review highlights the relative absence of a uniform definition of a heat wave within these studies. Notably, humidity and temperature measures such as apparent temperature and heat index (HI) were not universally analyzed within the studies. For example, Dadvand et al. [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] regarded HI to be a principal measure of exposure while Auger et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] regarded humidity as a potential confounder.
