Specific time frames range from the week preceding birth, three weeks, one month, or throughout the course of the warm season with births occurring within that three-month interval. These sub-full gestation studies all investigated preterm birth or shortened gestation. Heat findings were significantly correlated within all sub-full gestation exposure periods, with the exception of preterm birth within a one-week exposure in Auger et al. [
