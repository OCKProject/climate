<p class="p">Overall, heat exposure was highly correlated with adverse outcomes, 32 significant findings in 36 investigations of adverse outcomes within 28 studies. In the instance that both temperature measures were significantly associated with outcomes, the hazards distribution followed a nonlinear U shape (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00853-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). These findings primarily occurred in studies examining preterm birth or early term birth, and occurred in exposure periods ranging from the full length of gestation to exposures in the last week of gestation. Heat was largely correlated with a decrease in birth weight, decreased gestational length, increased risk of still birth, and increases in neonatal stress and mortality. While stillbirths followed a linear relationship, birthweight and gestational length and temperature were nonlinear.
