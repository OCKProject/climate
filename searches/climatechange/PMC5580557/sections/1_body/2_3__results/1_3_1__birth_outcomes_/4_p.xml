<p class="p">Lastly, two studies examining immediate neonatal impacts due to ambient temperature exposure were included in this review. Both demonstrated that heat waves increase stress in neonates, either as a function of heat-related neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admissions [

 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Kakkad et al. [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] specifically explored NICU admissions on extreme heat days in Ahmedabad, India, where most births occur outside of hospitals and extreme heat is considered to be an excess of 42 Â°C; heat waves resulted in an increase of admissions. Basu et al. [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] uncovered effect modification within infant death rates during warm season months in California where Black children were more likely to die than other racial subgroups.
