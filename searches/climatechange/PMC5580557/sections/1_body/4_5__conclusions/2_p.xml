<p class="p">Due to climate change, increasing heat waves are likely unavoidable in the coming century. Heat exposure promises to affect population health, such as developing fetuses and pregnant women. We are likely to see an increase in preterm birth, a decrease in birth weight, and an increase in stillbirth rates. After birth, neonates may be susceptible to heat-related morbidity and mortality, though additional research is required. These findings indicate the importance of ongoing public health efforts to combat local effects of climate change.</p>
