<p class="p">The World Health Organization and the World Meteorological Association have suggested that the heat exposure should be taken into consideration in both clinical care and public health programming. Vulnerability will play an additional role in heat-stress susceptibility. Current literature largely refers to heat-susceptible individuals as poor, elderly, young children, minority groups, outdoor workers, individuals with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular disorders, socially isolated individuals, and living in an urban heat island [

 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-14-00853" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]; notably, pregnant women are not included. However, limited thermoregulatory abilities warrants, dependent on medical care access, the inclusion of pregnant women as a vulnerable class in the face of heat exposure [

Vulnerability and warnings should be specified to local context. Heat tolerance and acclimatization may affect the heath of pregnant women and fetuses. The threshold temperature that results in significant effects varies by climate since women in each region have acclimatized to a relative threshold for extreme heat.
