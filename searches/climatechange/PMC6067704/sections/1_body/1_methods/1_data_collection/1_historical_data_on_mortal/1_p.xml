 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pmed.1002629.s001" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref>. In brief, since 2012, we have developed a Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network (

In this study, we used daily time series data from 412 communities within 20 countries/regions (

  <xref rid="pmed.1002629.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>
 </bold>). The dataset included observed daily time series for deaths counts for all causes or nonexternal causes (International Classification of Diseases [ICD]—ICD-9: 0–799; ICD-10: A00–R99) and daily mean temperature, in addition to weather variables (daily minimum and maximum temperatures and relative humidity). The observed daily mean temperature was measured as the average across 24 h or between maximum and minimum daily temperature from a single or multiple monitoring stations within the administrative boundaries of each community. Community-specific metavariables include weather indices derived from the series of observed temperatures (e.g., average and range of annual, summer, and winter temperatures), climatological zones based the Köppen–Geiger classification, and country-specific gross domestic product (GDP) per capita.
