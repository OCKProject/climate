<p class="p">We obtained climate projections from a database developed under the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP,

The ISIMIP database includes single runs of General Circulation Models (GCMs) developed within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Four greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP]2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], described in the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), were used. Specifically, the ISIMIP Fast Track database provides temperature series for each RCP for five GCMs, namely GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-ES, IPSL-CM5A-LR, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and NorESM1-M.15. These GCMs are representative of the range of projections of future climate across the CMIP5 models [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. The model outputs were bias-corrected and downscaled through bi-linear interpolation at a 0.5° × 0.5° spatial resolution and linear interpolated by day of the year [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. The modelled daily temperature series for each of the 412 communities in the period 1971–2099 were extracted by linking the coordinates with the corresponding grid cells of the climate projections.
