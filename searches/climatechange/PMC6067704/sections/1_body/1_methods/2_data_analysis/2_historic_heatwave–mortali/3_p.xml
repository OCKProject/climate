<p class="p">In the second stage, we modelled the community-specific effect estimates of the overall cumulative risk ratios (lag 0â€“10 days) associated with heatwaves using a meta-regression [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The meta-regression included a set of meta-predictors to capture part of the heterogeneity across locations (specifically, indicators for country, indicators for climate classification, and indicators for community-specific hot season average and range of temperature). We then derived the best linear unbiased prediction of the overall cumulative association in each community by the meta-regression, expressed as relative risk. This meta-prediction is only performed for the historical data and not for future data.
