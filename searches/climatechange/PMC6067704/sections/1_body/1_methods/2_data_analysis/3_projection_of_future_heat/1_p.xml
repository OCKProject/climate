<p class="p">Using the daily mean temperature output from each of five GCMs for the timeframe representing ‘future’ years, we calculated the number of heatwaves per year and the total number of heatwave days under a changing climate [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. We calculated expected excess deaths during heatwave days per year for each set of climate change scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5) and GCMs, from which we can compute the statistics of change. The expected number of excess deaths during a given heatwave period was calculated for each community as follows:

 </disp-formula> in which EDHW is excess deaths related to heatwaves; N is the average number of deaths on non-heatwave days (calculated from the ‘current’ years); HWN is the number of the future heatwave days; and RR is the relative risk of mortality in relation to heatwaves. POP is annual population, and MR is daily mortality rate (MR) across all non-heatwave days from the historical data for each community. To quantify the overall mortality impact of heatwaves, we computed the annual excess mortality attributable to heatwaves, which is the expected number of deaths in a 1-year period caused by all heatwaves in that year [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This summary of health impact incorporates the change in both the rate at which heatwaves occur and the number of heatwaves in the future. We calculated this summary in the two time periods (1971–2020 for present day and 2031–2080 for the future period), summing the excess deaths across all heatwaves and dividing by the total number of years. Then, we calculated the percent change for the period 2031–2080, using the period 1971–2020 as the baseline reference.
