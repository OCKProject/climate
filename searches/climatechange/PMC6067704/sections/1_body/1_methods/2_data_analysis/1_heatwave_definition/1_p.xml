<p class="p">There is no universally accepted definition of a heatwave, but most incorporate notions of intense heat experienced over a period of days [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In the present study, relative thresholds based on the community’s recent long-term daily mean temperature were used to define heatwaves, as they describe historic regional acclimatization to temperatures that were normal for a community. Heatwaves in each of the communities were defined as at least two consecutive days with daily mean temperature exceeding the 95th percentile of the year-round daily temperatures of that city from recent data (i.e., the years representing ‘current’ data).
