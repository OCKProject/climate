<p class="p">There will be an increase in the frequency and severity of heatwaves as the globe warms up [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. An important aspect of understanding the overall risk of climate change for human health is how heatwaves could affect mortality and morbidity under a changing climate [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Population vulnerability to heatwaves is strongly influenced by social and physical environments. Thus, the associations between heatwaves and health effects differ by cities, countries, and regions [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, little attention so far has been paid to the projections of heatwave effects across different regions using the same method [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. To date, most projections of heatwave-related deaths are limited to a few cities/one country or used a small number of climate models [
