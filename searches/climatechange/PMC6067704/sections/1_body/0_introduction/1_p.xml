<p class="p">A heatwave is often defined as hot outdoor temperature or hot weather that lasts for several days that is outside the normal range of ambient temperatures [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. They are related to acute cerebrovascular accidents, aggravate chronic pulmonary conditions, cardiac conditions, kidney disorders, and psychiatric illness [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Heatwaves can cause a significant impact on population health, including a rise in mortality [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. A number of major heatwave events occurred over the past decade, many of which had devastating effects [

 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. For example, the European heatwaves in the summer of 2003 were responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. The 2010 Russian heatwaves killed the estimated 55,000 people [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Importantly, heatwaves have a greater impact on mortality or morbidity than the reported number of deaths or cases due to classical heat illness (e.g., thermoplegia, heatstroke, heat cramp, and heat syncope), because heatwaves also induce the onset of other diseases, for example, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases, and diabetes. Thus, heatwaves are a critical public health problem.
