<p class="p">To estimate future heatwave-related excess mortality, we relied on many assumptions. Multiple climate model simulations of future climate change were used to account for variation in climate models’ structural assumptions, an important source of uncertainty in future projections [
 <xref rid="pmed.1002629.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Intermodel variability is significant even at global average scales, but it becomes increasingly relevant as the output of global models is used to describe climate change at small regional scales and for high-frequency quantities like daily output, as in the case of our analysis. In addition, we used meta-regression with historical data to project historical community-specific heatwave–mortality relative risks to project future heatwave-related excess mortality in that community. Although this method cannot solve the problem that future relative risks might be different than those in the past, this can eliminate the potential between-city differences when applying historical data from a warmer city to predict the future mortality of another warming city [
