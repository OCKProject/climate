<p id="Par14" class="p">In contrast to many small-scale MPA networks or marine spatial planning processes, designation of LMPAs to date has been opportunistic rather than systematic, resulting in uneven representation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). To create a representative network of LMPAs - rather than the current ad hoc set - decision-support tools such as Marxan

Internationally recognized political targets, including the Sustainable Development Goal 14.5 and Aichi Target 11, call for 10% of ecologically representative marine areas to be protected by 2020. While somewhat arbitrary, such targets are useful for monitoring and evaluating global conservation efforts and are crucial in guiding conservation policies worldwide – with representation a key biodiversity conservation strategy
