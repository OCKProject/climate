<p id="Par15" class="p">Considering the present and also projected future distributions of species in identifying new LMPAs will be critical to ensure species’ persistence. Because of projected range retractions, the current set of LMPAs is projected to represent a higher proportion of species’ ranges in the future than today, but some - sharks, skates and rays, and birds - will lose protection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Coverage of sharks, skates and rays is particularly critical because they also had the largest projected decrease in range size, and these are species postulated to benefit from LMPAs

 </sup>, will be important for targeted protection and improving the long-term representation of these species under climate change. Explicit consideration of species’ future range shifts and retractions is critical to effective representation and a number of Aichi Targets, particularly Strategic Goal C to safeguard species and Target 12 to prevent extinctions.
