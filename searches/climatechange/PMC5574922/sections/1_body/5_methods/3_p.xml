 </sup>. We used all LMPAs that were officially designated as of December 2015 (defined as having a legal boundary; n = 53, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). We do not differentiate between varying levels of implementation or management because this information was not readily available. We consider two additional sites – East Antarctic and Ross Sea – that have been proposed for a long time (Ross Sea has since been designated (October 2016)). However, we focused our results on the designated LMPAs as of December 2015, but note the contribution of these proposed LMPAs. The MPA data were aggregated to 0.5 degree grids to match the resolution of the species range maps. We determined the proportion of the MPA in each 0.5 degree square. Because we do not know the exact distribution of species within each grid, we assumed that the area of a species range represented in MPAs was equal to the area of MPA coverage for grid cells that species were present in, and therefore we likely over-estimate species representation in LMPAs

 </sup>. However, in 73% of cells containing MPAs, the MPA covered more than 90% of the cell’s ocean area, and in 84% of the cells containing MPAs, the MPA covered more than 50% of the cell’s ocean area (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). We summarize the data by the five largest phyla (Arthropoda, Chordata, Cnidaria, Echinodermata, and Mollusca), with Chordata split into its six largest classes (Actinopterygii, Aves, Ascidiacea, Elasmobranchii, Mammalia, Reptilia), because it had the largest number of species, and many of them are of conservation importance.
