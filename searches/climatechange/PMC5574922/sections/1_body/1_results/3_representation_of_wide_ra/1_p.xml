<p id="Par11" class="p">Species with the largest ranges had the highest median range representation in LMPAs (&gt;4,490,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; median 9.31%, and 7.53% for large and extra large category respectively), with species with medium ranges (1,570,000–4,490,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; median 3.12%) with the lowest median range representation (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> &amp; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). In the future, many species are projected to experience range retractions and so the number of species within the medium range category increases, as did the median range representation of species in this category (10.5%). Species with the largest ranges generally maintain a good level of representation, with species in the large range category increasing their median representation (9.3% to 11.0%), although there was a decrease in the median representation for species in the extra large range category (7.5% to 5.5%; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> &amp; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>).
