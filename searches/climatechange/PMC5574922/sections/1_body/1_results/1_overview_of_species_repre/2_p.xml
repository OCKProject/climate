<p id="Par5" class="p">For future distributions, LMPAs are projected to represent a higher proportion of species’ ranges in the future than today due to the projected range retractions of many species, despite this not being an explicit design intention. The percentage of species with at least 10% of their range represented in LMPAs is projected to increase to 40.1% in 2100 (Fig.
