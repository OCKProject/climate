<p id="Par3" class="p">Despite this contention, LMPAs remain a prominent strategy for marine biodiversity conservation. In order to address this debate and move forward with large-scale marine conservation we need to understand how LMPAs contribute to representation of species. In this paper we provide the first quantification of their potential contribution to marine biodiversity conservation now and under a climate change scenario (year 2100, IPCC SRES A2 scenario)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup> by assessing the overlap of LMPAs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) with all marine species for which modelled distribution data exist

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup> (n = 14,172). We use our results to identify five key recommendations to improve the long-term representation of all species and assist in meeting key global policy goals.
