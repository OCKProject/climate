  <p class="p">The percentage of speciesâ€™ ranges represented in large marine protected areas for current and future distributions (year 2100). The violin plots show the percentage of species that do not meet (light blue), or meet or exceed (dark blue) 10% protection (red dotted line). Data are shown for all species found within designated large marine protected areas (all), for the five largest phyla (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>); and for Chordata by its six largest classes (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>). The light gray dashed lines indicate how these distributions would change with the addition of two networks of proposed Antarctic large marine protected areas. Figure created by Terra Communications
