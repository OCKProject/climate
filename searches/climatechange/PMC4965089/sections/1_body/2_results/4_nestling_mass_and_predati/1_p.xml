<p class="p">Treatment, brood size, nestling age, site and invertebrate availability are all significant predictors of nestling mass (
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The mean difference in nestling mass between day four and day six is 2.90 g (± 0.10 g;

 <sub class="sub">1,455</sub> = 1520.74;

 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,457</sub> = 6.79; 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.0094). Brood size is also a highly significant predictor of nestling mass, with larger broods containing lighter nestlings (-0.52 ± 0.09; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,456</sub> = 35.93, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.0001). There is a significant and substantial effect of treatment on nest predation, with control nests suffering 21 predation events out of 61 nests (34%), and fed nests suffering one predation event out of 41 nests (2.5%; Fisher’s exact test; odds ratio = 0.07, 
 <italic class="italic">P&lt;</italic>0.0001). The 21 depredated control nests suffered complete predation of eggs, while the single depredated fed nest suffered the loss of two eggs (retaining three successfully hatched eggs). The study did not record any incidences of nestling predation from either treatment group.
