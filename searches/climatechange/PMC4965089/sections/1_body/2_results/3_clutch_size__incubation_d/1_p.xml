<p class="p">Of the 102 nests monitored, only 80 completed their clutch, with the other 20 completely depredated, abandoned or destroyed by bad weather before clutch completion. Most completed clutches (69) contained a total of four eggs, ten clutches contained five eggs and one clutch contained three eggs. Clutch size is uncorrelated with treatment (
