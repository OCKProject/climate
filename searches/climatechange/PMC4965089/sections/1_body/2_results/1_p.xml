<p class="p">Between 2012 and 2014, 200 breeding adult reed warblers, 102 nests, 416 eggs and 324 nestlings were monitored in CBWR and CLCP. With these data it is possible to examine how increases in food availability during the early stage of the breeding season affect different reproductive parameters of breeding reed warblers.</p>
