<p class="p">We assess how different aspects of breeding behaviour including laying date, clutch size, incubation period, nestling growth and first brood productivity responded to increasing food availability. We predict that: i) reed warblers will respond to increases in food availability by advancing their laying date and increasing nestling growth rates, in order to prioritise advancement of first brood completion; ii) clutch size will be unchanged in favour of maintaining a short period of incubation; and iii) the net effect of increased food availability will result in an increase in first brood productivity as well as earlier fledging of the first brood. Late completion of first broods may preclude the successful completion of second broods [

These mechanisms, linking protracted climate-driven increases in food supply across the spring in wetland habitats, to reed warbler breeding behaviour and productivity, may explain the current growth of reed warbler populations.
