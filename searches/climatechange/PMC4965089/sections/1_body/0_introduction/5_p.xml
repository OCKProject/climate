<p class="p">In this study, we test this limitation by experimentally increasing food availability (i.e. through the supply of more food) for a sample of breeding reed warblers, during the early stages of three breeding seasons, and compared the behaviour and breeding performance of this sample with that of a control group with natural food availability. Individual breeding pairs were supplemented with an unlimited food supply; they could not be provisioned with the additional amount of food predicted to occur under a particular climate projection. This was because multiple birds (and species) used the same supplementary feeders and so precisely regulating the amount of food for each pair was not feasible. The study should not, therefore, be viewed as an attempt to simulate future food availability. Rather, by 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> food supplementation during the early stages of the breeding season, at a time when the natural levels of food availability are gradually increasing, the food peak can be artificially and immediately advanced. This approach allows focussed investigation of the aspects of reed warbler behaviour and breeding performance that are currently limited by food availability during the early stages of the breeding season.
