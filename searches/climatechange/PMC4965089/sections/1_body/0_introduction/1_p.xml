<p class="p">A central task for ecologists is to understand the drivers of population change and community structure. Food availability is a central consideration and understanding food limitation in natural populations helps to inform the impacts of environmental change on animal populations. In this study, we investigate the mechanisms linking changes in food availability with changes in the breeding behaviour and productivity of a bird population. Migratory insectivorous songbirds are well-studied and respond to short-term changes in the environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For example, in temperate regions, climate change is advancing the emergence dates of invertebrates in spring, so that food for many breeding insectivorous songbirds peaks earlier in the breeding season [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. As income breeders, whose breeding productivity depends primarily on current resources [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], songbirds require large quantities of food to support the energetically costly activities of egg production, incubation and nestling provisioning. The breeding season is therefore a period when birds are strongly affected by changes in food abundance, and in the timing of food availability.
