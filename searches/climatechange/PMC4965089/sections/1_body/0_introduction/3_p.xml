 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. In multi-brooding species, earlier initiation and completion of the first brood can result in a greater likelihood of successful completion of the second brood, and higher overall productivity [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. However, while larger clutches potentially increase first brood productivity by producing more offspring, the larger clutches take longer to lay and incubate [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. As well as delaying the completion of the first brood, additional eggs prolong the period of high vulnerability to nest predation and brood parasitism [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In order to maximise overall productivity, birds could prioritise early completion of the first brood by maintaining typical clutch sizes. Increases in food availability earlier in the breeding season may result in higher breeding success and population growth by enabling earlier breeding and faster nestling growth, particularly if birds do not increase their clutch size. In the present study, we use a food supplementation experiment to measure the extent to which changes in food availability (as may occur in future climate scenarios) may drive changes in the different aspects of breeding behaviour that can affect overall demography.
