<p class="p">Prey availability for reed warblers was experimentally increased across the two study sites over three breeding seasons by providing live and dried mealworms, 
 <italic class="italic">Tenebrio molitor</italic> larvae (Coleoptera), in containers (2 litre-capacity) resting on small tables at 1.5 m height, from 1st of April onwards. Each study site supports three feeding stations, which were supplied with at least 200 mealworms (mean weight ± SD of mealworms = 112.00 ± 2.60 g, n = 100) and refilled every day (when required), until the end of the breeding season (September). Feeding bowls were enclosed in a wire mesh cage (measuring 300 x 200 x 200 mm of 10mm mesh) to prevent the mealworms being taken by carrion crows (
 <italic class="italic">Corvus corvus</italic>) and black-billed magpies (
 <italic class="italic">Pica pica</italic>), but permitting access to reed warblers. Each feeding station was regularly visited by between three and five pairs of colour-ringed breeding reed warblers each season (CBWR 2013–2014: 22 supplemented pairs out of 56 monitored territories; CLCP 2012–2013: 19 supplemented pairs out of 46 monitored territories). Other small passerines including European robins (
 <italic class="italic">Erithacus rubecula</italic>), common reed buntings (
 <italic class="italic">Emberiza schoeniclus</italic>) and Eurasian blue tits (
 <italic class="italic">Cyanistes caeruleus</italic>) occasionally gained access to the mealworms, but mealworms were always available for reed warblers using the feeders. All adults nesting within 50 m of the feeding stations discovered the mealworms within two to five days, and fed daily on the supplemented food from the laying period until the end of the breeding season in late July. Fed and control sites were located at least 150 m apart, to minimise the likelihood of accidental supplementary feeding of control birds visiting fed areas (no such incidences were observed). This was confirmed by individually identifying the adult reed warblers using the feeding stations and by remotely monitoring the stations with small video cameras (Sony Handycam DCR-SR32, Sony Corporation,

Activity around the feeding stations was recorded between 06:00 and 18:00 BST every two days throughout the breeding cycle. The positions of feeding stations were moved between successive breeding seasons to allow the treatment state of site-faithful individuals to change between years.
