<p class="p">The mean total height of all 
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites</italic> stems (from ground level to the top of the uppermost panicle) supporting each nest when the first egg was laid was measured using a fixed measuring rod. In order to obtain a measure of the status of 
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites</italic> growth at the time of egg-laying, the mean total height is transformed into positive or negative differences of the overall mean total height of all measured stems (i.e. ‘
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites</italic> height index’).
