Where appropriate, the identity number for each nest is used as a random effect in mixed-effects models to account for repeated measures (e.g. nestling measurements) from the same nest. The final models are selected using backward deletion of non-significant (P&gt; 0.05) terms. The rates of predation are compared between fed and unfed treatments using a Fisher’s exact test due to the low instances of predation in the treatment group. Data exploration and model validation procedures follow the protocol described in Zuur

Outliers are identified using Cleveland plots, and collinearity is assessed using pair plots and variance inflation factor values. Homogeneity of variance is assessed by plotting the model residuals against the fitted values, and normality of residuals is assessed using histogram and QQ plots. Finally, influential observations are assessed using Cooks’ distance values.
