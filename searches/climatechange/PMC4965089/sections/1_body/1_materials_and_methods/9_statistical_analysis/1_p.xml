<p class="p">This study tests the effects of food treatment on reed warbler laying date, clutch size, incubation duration, hatching success, rates of nestling growth, and overall first brood productivity (of all nesting attempts). As well as the availability of food, these reproductive parameters may also be affected by factors such as local weather conditions, and by other unmeasured constraints which may vary by year and site (e.g. competitive pressure, predator density).</p>
