<p class="p">The guidelines promoted by the Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour for the ethical use of animals in research are followed. The species caught as part of this study are common and not registered as an endangered or protected species in any country. All fieldwork was conducted after ethical approval from the British Trust for Ornithology ringing unit (Vafidis licence no; 5475; Facey licence no: 5411; Thomas licence no: 4127). Special approval from the animal ethics committee was not required for these activities as they are included on the authorsâ€™ bird ringing licences.</p>
