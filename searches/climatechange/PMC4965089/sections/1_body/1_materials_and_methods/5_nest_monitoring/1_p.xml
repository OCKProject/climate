<p class="p">Active nests (n = 102) were located by systematic searching of suitable nesting habitat (dense, tall stands of 
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites</italic>) and by visually tracking adults back to the nest. The status of each nest was checked every two days until the first eggs were laid (in April and May), then they were checked twice a day (at ~10:00 and ~16:00 BST) until fledging (in June and July). In order to minimise disturbance to breeding birds and damage to 
 <italic class="italic">Phragmites</italic> habitat, only first broods were monitored in this study.
