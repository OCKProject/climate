<p class="p">Consistent with our findings, experimental increases in food availability are associated with earlier breeding dates in other passerine birds, including Eurasian blue tit [

 <italic class="italic">Turdus merula</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. Many of these species rely on highly seasonal prey resources (e.g. caterpillars) and therefore risk mismatch between supply and demand if they nest too late. This is less likely for reed warblers, which feed their young on a diverse range of invertebrate prey populations which emerge sequentially throughout the summer, resulting in a prolonged period of high abundance without any clear peak [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. Instead, reed warblers may be taking advantage of the higher abundance of invertebrates and earlier reed growth under warmer spring conditions to maximise fitness of their offspring by breeding earlier, enabling longer periods to acquire experience in foraging before autumn migration [
