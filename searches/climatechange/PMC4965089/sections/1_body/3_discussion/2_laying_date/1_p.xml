<p class="p">Supplemental food advances the laying date by up to 5.6 (Â± 0.3) days during the warmest mean April temperatures. These results are consistent with observational studies of reed warblers [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], where earlier breeding was associated with warmer May to July temperatures. Continental European populations of reed warbler have been reported to be laying 18 days earlier over the last 33 years [

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>], but it has been unclear whether the primary driver behind earlier laying is the faster growth of nesting vegetation, or the earlier rise in availability of invertebrate prey. The relationship identified between later laying dates and higher values of invertebrate availability and reed height is likely to be correlated with time rather than more invertebrate prey and higher reeds driving later breeding. The significant food supplementation effect on laying phenology in our study suggests that laying date is constrained by food availability, as birds in both treatments were exposed to the same

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]) has advanced sufficiently to provide habitat suitable for earlier nest building.
