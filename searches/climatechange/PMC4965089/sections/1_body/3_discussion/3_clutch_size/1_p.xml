<p class="p">Clutch size in reed warblers appears to be less variable than in many other passerine species [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. This may represent the outcome of a trade-off between current reproductive effort and future reproduction and survival [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Maintaining small clutch sizes reduces the period of egg-laying, as well as the duration required for incubation and nestling periods [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. The advantages of this include reducing the period of vulnerability to predators and brood parasites [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], as well as leading to the earlier initiation of subsequent broods. Such benefits may outweigh the gains of increasing the clutch size of the first brood.
