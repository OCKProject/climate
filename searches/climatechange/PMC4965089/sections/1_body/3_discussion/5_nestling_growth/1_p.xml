<p class="p">Supplementary feeding of parent reed warblers resulted in an increased rate of nestling growth. Nestlings of food-supplemented parents weighed 0.5 g (± 0.2) more at day six than nestlings of unsupplemented parents, which could be explained by more rapid growth or heavier stomach contents due to earlier feeding before being measured [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>]. Increases in food abundance, parental investment and predation have all been shown to modify nestling growth rate in

 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Likewise, the offspring of supplementally fed great tits grew faster than control nestlings [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. Greater prey availability for parents is therefore likely to increase nestling growth rates, which could accelerate fledging and thus reduce the period of vulnerability to predation and adverse weather conditions. Nestling reed warblers normally fledge after 10–11 days but are able to jump from the nest to evade predators from day seven [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Given the high rates of predation in wetlands [
 <xref rid="pone.0159933.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], adaptations to reduce the period of nestling vulnerability are likely to be strongly favoured by selection.
