<p class="p">Using supplementary feeding, this study investigates how changes in food availability affect different reproductive parameters that, together, influence the breeding success of reed warblers. Fed birds have earlier laying dates, higher nestling masses, and more fledged young. Incubation period was shorter in fed treatment groups when the mean April temperatures were warmest. In contrast, food supplementation does not measurably influence clutch size or hatching success.</p>
