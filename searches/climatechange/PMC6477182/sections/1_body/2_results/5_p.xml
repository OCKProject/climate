<p class="p">In the model marsh of San Bruno (Guadiana Estuary), the number of tussocks identified as 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> in middle marshes (205 tussocks) was much higher than that of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> in low marshes (18 tussocks). According to the estimated ages of these tussocks, the first hybrid to be established was 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> (ca. year 1813) while the first tussock of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> did not appear until 1984. Since 2007, no novel tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> have been established, while the latest tussock of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> dates back to 2016 (
