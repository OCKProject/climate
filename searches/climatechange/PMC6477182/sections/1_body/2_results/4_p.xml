<p class="p">The number of recorded annually established tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> between 1955 and 2017 was positively correlated with mean maximum temperature in June, mean average and maximum temperatures in July (β = +1.219 and −0.449, respectively), and mean average temperature in August (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). On the contrary, the annual number of recorded established tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> was negatively correlated with mean average and maximum temperatures in June and mean maximum temperature in July and August (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). In all cases, the slopes of the negative regressions between the numbers of established tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> and maximum monthly temperatures were higher than the positives slopes for 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Additionally, the annual number of established tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> increased together with mean average and maximum rainfall in June. Rainfall accounted for less weight in the model than air temperatures (average temperature: β = +0.917; maximum temperature: β = −1.396; average rainfall: β = +0.326; maximum rainfall: β = 0.373). Moreover, both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids showed a negative correlation between them regarding the annual number of established tussocks (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). No correlation was found between the number of established hybrids and any of the monthly meteorological parameters in May or in September (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>).
