<p class="p">The number of annually established tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> was also higher in the years with higher rainfall in June. Published accounts on the effects of climate change on flowering phenology have found no direct relationships between high rainfalls and change in flowering of grasses (

 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sherry et al., 2007</xref>), including cordgrasses such as 
 <italic class="italic">S. alterniflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina patens</italic> (Aiton) Muhl. (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Charles and Dukes, 2009</xref>). However, an increase in rainfall during the beginning of the summer would lead to a reduction in soil salinity in salt marshes (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burdick et al., 2001</xref>), which would favor the development of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> (

 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Naidoo et al., 2012</xref>). High salinities can reduce flowering of halophytes (

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ventura et al., 2014</xref>). In this sense, 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. foliosa</italic> from San Francisco Bay reduced their production of inflorescences at hypersalinity in relation to lower salinities (Gallego-Tévar et al., unpublished data). In our study, rainfall was only related to the establishment of the hybrid 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> in middle marshes, which is consistent with the fact that the highest salinities during the dry season (summer) are reached in middle marshes (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Contreras-Cruzado et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, according to our results, 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> hybrids were formed mostly between 1961–1984 coinciding with the years of lower maximum temperatures and higher rainfall of the period 1955–2017. However, changing flowering phenology of the parental species seemed to be the process driving the switch in the appearance of studied reciprocal hybrids. The influence of environmental conditions, such as salinity, on the establishment of these hybrids cannot be ruled out as factor determining their abundance (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Noe and Zedler, 2001</xref>). In this sense, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallego-Tévar et al. (2018a)</xref> revealed that studied 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids colonized sediments with lower salinities than their parental species. Therefore, an increase in sediment salinity due to higher evapotranspiration and sea level raise combined with reduced rainfall could limit the establishment of the hybrids. Nevertheless, both studied hybrids show higher fitness than their parents at high salinities due to transgressive traits as adult plants (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallego-Tévar et al., 2018b</xref>), which could support their growth and their competitive ability in future climate change scenarios.
