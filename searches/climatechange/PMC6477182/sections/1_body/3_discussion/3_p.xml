<p class="p">As a consequence of the greater lateral expansion rate of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> in relation to 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic>, its tussocks were dated younger, despite having both hybrids similar sizes. When the number of annually established hybrid tussocks (1955–2017), according to their estimated ages, was related to meteorological conditions, correlations were found for both hybrids with mean maximum monthly temperature in June, July and August. These were the only months for which significant increases in temperatures were registered in the analyzed time period, being also these months the common period of flowering for both parental species (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Valdes et al., 1987</xref>). The above-mentioned increase in air temperature during the end of spring and the beginning of summer was consistent with the predictions of climate change models for the Mediterranean region (

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kovats et al., 2014</xref>). The correlations between the number of established tussocks and mean maximum monthly temperatures were positive for 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> and negative for 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic>. Therefore, an alternation in the establishment of both hybrids in relation to changing climatic conditions was observed, so that 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> establishment increased and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> decreased in warmer spring-summers, and 
 <italic class="italic">vice versa</italic>. Even with an error interval of 1 year in our dating of hybrid tussocks, their establishment would be related to atmospheric temperatures since they, in general, tended to increase more than most of the recorded interannual differences.
