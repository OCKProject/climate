<p class="p">The lateral expansion rates of the hybrids 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina maritima × densiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> were different from each other and similar to those of their corresponding seed parents, revealing the maternal influence on this plant trait. Maternal effect is a relevant process in gene expression of hybrids (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Videvall et al., 2016</xref>) such as for growth characteristics of 
 <italic class="italic">Seneceio jacobea × aquaticus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirk et al., 2005</xref>) or the hybrids between transgenic 
 <italic class="italic">Brassica napus</italic> L. and wild 
 <italic class="italic">B. juncea</italic> (L.) Vassilii Matveievitch (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Di et al., 2009</xref>). For the reciprocal hybrids 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic>, maternal effects have been previously observed in their response to different salinities (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallego-Tévar et al., 2018b</xref>). The recorded greater expansion rate of native 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> was consistent with its growth form in “guerrilla” (
 <italic class="italic">sensu</italic>
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lovett Doust and Lovett Doust, 1982</xref>) in which asexual lateral spreading by long rhizomes predominates over sexual reproduction (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castellanos et al., 1994</xref>). In contrast, invasive caespitose 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> exhibited short rhizomes, growing in “phalanx” (
 <italic class="italic">sensu</italic>
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lovett Doust and Lovett Doust, 1982</xref>) and forming dense tussocks (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo J. et al., 2010</xref>), with its dispersion occurring mainly by seeds (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kittelson and Milton, 1997</xref>). The lateral expansion rate recorded in this study for 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> was in the range of that reported previously by 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Figueroa et al. (2003)</xref> (38 cm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) and by 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo and Figueroa (2009b)</xref> (26 cm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) in Odiel Marshes. Similarly, the recorded lateral expansion rate for 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> was comparable to those reported by 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kittelson and Milton (1997)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nieva et al. (2005)</xref> (ca. 8 cm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The lateral expansion rates of both hybrids may be explained by their growth forms in relation to their parental species. Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> expanded laterally more rapidly and with longer rhizomes than 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic>. Both hybrids formed dense turfs of tillers within their tussocks like 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic>, but more clearly differentiated and of bigger sizes, so that the turfs of tillers within hybrid tussocks presented similar growth form than individuals tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic>, but with taller tillers (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>; Gallego-Tévar, personal observation). The bare spaces within the hybrid turfs usually constituted intertidal ponds or were occupied by other halophytes (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>; Gallego-Tévar, personal observation), while the turfs of tillers within tussocks were rarely colonized by other halophytes (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gallego-Tévar et al., 2018a</xref>).
