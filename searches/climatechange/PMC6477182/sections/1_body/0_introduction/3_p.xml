 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Santamar√≠a, 2002</xref>). The asexual reproduction of clonal growth results in size expansion of genets and increased fitness as greater floral production in larger clones increases the potential for outcrossing and sexual reproduction (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Barrett, 2015</xref>). Extreme longevity of clonal species allow genets to persist through periods with environmental conditions when sexual reproduction is rare or precluded. Clonality is a survival strategy of plant species that may support longevity at millennial timescales and through rapid global environmental changes (
