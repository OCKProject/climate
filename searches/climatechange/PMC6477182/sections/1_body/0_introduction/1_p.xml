<p class="p">New climatic conditions induced by global warming can lead to alterations of different biological processes in both plant and animal species (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bellard et al., 2012</xref>). In this context, it is expected that many species will not be able to adapt to the new conditions, leading to a generalized increase of the extinction rate (
