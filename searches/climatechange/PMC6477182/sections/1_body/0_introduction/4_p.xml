<p class="p">Cordgrasses (genus 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic>) are an adequate model for the study of hybridization between native and invasive species since there are different documented examples of interspecific hybridization after the introduction of one species in the native range of another (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Strong and Ayres, 2013</xref>). These halophytic grasses, typical of tidal marshes, exhibit both sexual and clonal reproduction by rhizomes (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo and Figueroa, 2009a</xref>), forming clones that can remain for long periods of time (

 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Travis and Hester, 2005</xref>). Asexual expansion by rhizomes is key for the colonization of surrounding areas around 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> clones (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo and Figueroa, 2009a</xref>), whereas sexual reproduction by abundant seeds dispersed to short, medium and long distances allow them to colonize new salt marshes (

 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> are anemophilous and protogynous species (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Davis et al., 2004</xref>), whose flowering period occurs in the warm season (late spring-summer) and is controlled by environmental factors such as temperature or photoperiod (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gray et al., 1991</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thompson, 1991</xref>). Previous studies on 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina alterniflora</italic> Loisel., 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina anglica</italic> C.E.Hubb., and 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina patens</italic> (Aiton) Muhl., revealed that protogyny negatively affects autogamy (self-pollination) favoring cross-pollination (

 <italic class="italic">Spartina maritima</italic> (Curtis) Fernald and invasive 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina densiflora</italic> Brongn. from the East Coast of South America have hybridized giving rise to two sterile reciprocal hybrids: 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> has colonized low marshes and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> has invaded middle marshes (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Castillo J.M. et al., 2010</xref>). According to the predictions of climate change models, these cordgrass populations will be subjected to increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation that will be more accentuated during the summer season (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Anaya-Romero et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2015</xref>). In order to know how these climatic changes are affecting the process of hybridization between native and invasive species, we carried out a study in which we dated different clones of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> based on their size and lateral expansion rates in three estuaries of the Gulf of Cádiz. Then, their establishment dates were related to the historical data of rainfall and temperature. Our hypothesis was that the increase in temperature and decrease in rainfall associated with climate change would induce changes in the reproductive traits of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic>, altering the process of hybridization between both species, since both parental species show high levels of phenotypic plasticity in response to changing environmental conditions (
