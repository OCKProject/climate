<p class="p">Biological invasions and their drastic alteration of natural ecosystems are widespread and have long been recognized as a significant component of global environmental change (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vitousek et al., 1997</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Understanding how environmental change factors are influencing fundamental biological processes is imperative for conservation and management of natural ecosystems. The continued spread of non-native plant species, synergistic with accelerating global environmental changes, poses significant challenges for understanding how natural ecosystems and the native plant communities will be altered (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Drenovsky et al., 2012</xref>). Once introduced, one way by which invasive species displace or exclude native species is through hybridization and introgression (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rhymer and Simberloff, 1996</xref>), diluting or assimilating the native genotype (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huxel, 1999</xref>). Global change is expected to increase the likelihood of hybridization between native and invasive species (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Muhlfeld et al., 2014</xref>), both by the increment in the introduction of species, and the changes in their ranges so that sympatry between divergent species may increase (

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoffmann and Sgr√≤, 2011</xref>). However, studies on the biological processes underlying the increase in interspecific hybridization related to climate change are limited (
