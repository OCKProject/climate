<p class="p">Lateral expansion rates of hybrid tussocks were calculated as a preliminary step to estimate their age. Lateral expansion rates (cm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) by rhizomes of the tussocks of both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids were calculated as the maximum diameter increment of individual tussocks in a given period; recording their diameter twice in different dates. For this purpose, the diameters of five tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> and 24 tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> were measured in Guadiana Estuary (37° 10′–37° 16′ N, 7° 16′–7° 28′ W) in February 2005. Also, the diameters of one tussock of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic> and two tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic> were recorded in Piedras Estuary (37° 12′–37° 18′ N, 7° 06′–7° 12′ W) in March 2005 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). In order to compare the lateral expansion rates of both hybrids with their parental species, we also recorded the maximum diameter of 13 tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> in January and September 2000 and of seven tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> in February 1997 and June 1999 at the East of Bacuta Island in Odiel Marshes (37° 13′ 41″ N; 6° 57′ 41″ W), and of other 10 tussocks of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> in October 1996 and September 2000 at the left bank of the main channel of the Tinto-Odiel Estuary (37° 13′ 32″ N; 6° 57′ 06″ W). All measured tussocks were chosen randomly in each sampled population. All the maximum diameters of the individuals of both hybrids and both parental species were remeasured in May 2018.
