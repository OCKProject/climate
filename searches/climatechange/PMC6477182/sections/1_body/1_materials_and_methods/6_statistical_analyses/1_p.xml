<p class="p">All the analyses were applied with a significance level (α) of 0.05 and they were conducted using the software Sigma-Plot for Windows (version 12.0, Systat Software Inc., IL, United States). Data series were verified for normality with the Shapiro-Wilk’s test and for homoscedasticity with Levene’s test, before the application of parametric analyses. In cases when data transformations (inverse, square root, or logarithm) were insufficient to meet assumptions of the parametric models, non-parametric tests were conducted. The lateral expansion rates of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> and their hybrids were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks, using taxa as grouping factor and Dunn’s test as 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> analysis. Diameter and estimated age of both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids were compared using Mann-Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">U</italic>-test and Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test for impendent samples, respectively. Pollen:ovule ratio for 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> was compared between 2017 and 2018 using Student’s 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test for paired samples. To explore the relationships between the establishment of both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids and meteorological conditions, linear correlations (Pearson coefficient) between the numbers of annually established hybrids and monthly meteorological variables, and linear regressions between the numbers of annually established hybrids and mean maximum temperature were carried out. When the number of annually established hybrids was correlated with two or more meteorological variables, multiple regression analysis was carried out to explore relative weights (β).
