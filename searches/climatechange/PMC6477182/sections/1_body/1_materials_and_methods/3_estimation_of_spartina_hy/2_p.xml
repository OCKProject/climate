<p class="p">The ages (in yr) of individual tussocks of both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids were estimated as the ratio between the tussock maximum diameter (cm) and its lateral expansion rate (cm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). Lateral expansion rate by rhizomes was recorded during periods longer than 10 years for both hybrids, integrating the environmental variability that hybrid tussocks were exposed to during significant periods of their actual life span. Our growth model considered that recorded integrated lateral expansion rates were constant during the whole life span of the studied tussocks, resulting in constant radial growth of the clone for uncrowded, density independent individual plants. In this sense, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dennis et al. (2011)</xref> showed that factors intrinsic to 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> tussocks dominated the effects of large scale abiotic factors on clone growth, resulting in constant radial growth over time. As in our study, previous works have estimated the age of clonal herbs also using the size of the genet and its growth rate (
