<p class="p">Flowering phenology and pollen:ovule ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> were studied since previous field observations suggested they may change considerably between years depending on changing environmental conditions. The duration of the flowering period of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> was evaluated for 20 tussocks during a warm flowering period in 2017 (mean temperature 24.1 ± 1.7°C and maximum temperature 30.6 ± 2.1°C for May–July) and for five tussocks during a mild flowering period in 2018 (mean temperature 21.4 ± 1.6°C and maximum temperature 27.2 ± 1.7°C for May–July) in Odiel Marshes. Information on the duration of the flowering period of 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> was obtained from
