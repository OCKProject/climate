<p class="p">The number of pollen grains per anther of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> was calculating by extracting five anthers from each of two tussocks in two different locations in July 2017, staining them in a mix of a few drops of cotton blue lactophenol solution in 1.5 ml of water, taking three aliquots of 10 Î¼l and counting pollen grains on a microscope slide. The total number of pollen grains per anther was calculated as product of the mean pollen concentration in the aliquots (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3) per the total volume of pollen suspension. The number of pollen grains per anther has been found to be constant in the Poaceae family (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Prieto-Baena et al., 2003</xref>). Subsequently, the calculated value of pollen grains per anther was used for the calculation of the pollen:ovule ratio of 
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> in 25 spikelets chosen randomly from each of 20 inflorescences collected at random from five tussocks in two locations in Odiel Marshes in July 2017 (warm flowering period) and July 2018 (mild flowering period). For this propose the number of spikelets with exerted stamens and the number of spikelets per inflorescence were counted during anthesis. Then, the number of exerted stamens per inflorescence was estimated as product of the number of spikelets with exerted stamens per the number of spikelets per inflorescence and by three stamens per spikelet. The number of pollen grains per inflorescence was calculated for 2017 and 2018 as the product of the number of pollen grains per anther and the number of exerted stamens per inflorescence. Finally, pollen:ovule ratio was calculated as the quotient of the number of pollen grains per inflorescence and the number of spikelets per inflorescence, since the 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> Genus presents an uniovular carpel and the number of seminal primordia per inflorescence corresponded to the number of spikelets on each inflorescence.
