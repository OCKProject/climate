<p class="p">Relationships between changing meteorological conditions and the establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids were recorded to analyze to effects of climate change on the invasion of hybrids. The year of establishment of every hybrid tussock was inferred from its estimated age. Then, the annual number of established tussocks for every 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrid (
 <italic class="italic">S. maritima × densiflora</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 25 tussocks; 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora × maritima</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 208 tussocks) was related to the meteorological conditions of every year of establishment. Meteorological monthly data (mean rainfall, maximum daily rainfall, mean of minimum, average and maximum temperatures) from 1955 to 2017 were obtained from the meteorological station of the city of Huelva (37°15′35.02″N, 6°56′55.37″W). This period of meteorological data is the maximum available in the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (

 <italic class="italic">S. maritima</italic> (May–September) and 
 <italic class="italic">S. densiflora</italic> (June–December) may coincide in the Gulf of Cadiz (
