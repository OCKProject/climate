<p class="p">Additionally, we studied the genet dynamics of the historical establishment of 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids in a model marsh known locally as San Bruno (Guadiana Estuary), where the greatest density of hybrids (hundreds) has been observed. With this aim, the diameter of each tussock and its spatial distribution (using a Garmin Oregon 550t decametric GPS [Garmin Ltd., KA, United States]) was recorded for both 
 <italic class="italic">Spartina</italic> hybrids in a total area of 28 ha in May 2018. The year of establishment of each hybrid tussock was estimated as reported above. Hybrid tussocks were classified according to their decade of establishment and represented on the corresponding aerial color photograph for each decade obtained from those available for the period 1943â€“2018 in the photo libraries of the Spanish National Geographical Institute (
