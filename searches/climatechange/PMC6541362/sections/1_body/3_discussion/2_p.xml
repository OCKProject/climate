<p class="p">Our findings support the hypothesis that plant species endemic to the Caatinga, especially those with specialized reproductive traits, are vulnerable to the effects of climate change, because their suitable habitat area will be reduced in both scenarios of climate projections. Geographic range contraction for endemic flowering plant species in seasonally-dry tropical forests have been predicted or observed previously (e.g. [

However, suitable habitat fidelity for Caatinga endemic plants is consistent with predictions for plants and birds endemics to tropical dry forests of Mexico and/or Mesoamerica, which indicate their future persistence in their current domains [
