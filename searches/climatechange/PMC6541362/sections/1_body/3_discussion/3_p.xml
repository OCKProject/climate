<p class="p">The concentration of habitats with suitable climatic conditions for endemic plant species in the northeastern most and least arid portion of this biome may be explained by abiotic factors, such as rainfall and water sources. Indeed, the plant species composition in the Caatinga may be strongly associated with rainfall (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]). In addition to increased precipitation in the peripheral regions compared to the core of Caatinga, the large concentration of rivers in the northern portion of this biome [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] may be positively associated with the distribution of habitats with suitable climatic conditions for endemic plants. This likely maintenance of suitable habitats for endemic plant species suggests habitat probable under climatic conditions reversing increased aridity. Coastal areas ensure higher humidity from the Atlantic-Equatorial air masses, which may result in greater water soil availability (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>]). Notwithstanding this concentration in the most favorable portion of the Caatinga, suitable climatic conditions for endemic plant species are unlikely to be displaced to areas outside their present phytogeographic domain even under severe climate change. All native plant species in the Caatinga, whether or not they are endemic, present a set of morphological, anatomical and ecophysiological adaptations to arid conditions, which ensures their permanence in this domain even under conditions of elevated temperatures and lower rainfall [
