<p class="p">As a consequence of shifts in the distribution of suitable climatic conditions for endemic plant species with the reproductive strategies considered here, negative cascade effects on plant-animal interactions, including pollinators and seed dispersers, are expected. With hotter and drier conditions, plant-pollinator interactions may be disrupted by advances or delays in flowering and fruiting phenology [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. In parallel, some groups of pollinators and seed dispersers may face reduced suitable habitat and changes in pupation and emergence times (e.g. [
