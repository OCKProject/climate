<p class="p">In conclusion, plant species endemic to the Caatinga are highly vulnerable to even conservative scenarios of future climate change and may lose much of their climatic envelopes. These threats are even greater for endemic species with specialized reproductive traits. Consequently, by reducing areas of suitable climatic conditions, climate change may disrupt key ecological interactions, such as pollination and seed dispersal, and compromise species maintenance and dynamics of communities of plants and animals in the Caatinga. The Caatinga has been historically threatened by chronic anthropogenic disturbances and the effects of climate change will further aggravate the impacts of these disturbances on biodiversity, particularly endemic plants. Studies investigating biodiversity and functional trait responses to the synergistic effects of both climate and land-use change are extremely important to guide management plans, and the conservation of natural resources in the Caatinga. Furthermore, since the Caatinga remains the least protected of all major biomes in Brazil, we suggest the creation of new protected areas that consider both the present and future species occurrence. New protected areas should, therefore, be located in the northeasternmost portion of the Caatinga, which has a more favorable climate, but is currently exposed to escalating agricultural intensification.</p>
