<p class="p">The distribution data for each generalist or specialized life history strategy was divided into a training group (75% of the 132 sampled occurrence points) and a test or validation group (25% of the 132 sampled occurrence points) to calibrate, optimize and evaluate the quality of models generated. We used the AUC, area under the operator characteristic curve (ROC), as a measure of model ability to discriminate sites based on species presence and absence to estimate model quality. AUC values ranged from 0 to 1. In this sense, models best adjusted to the data have AUC values closer to 1. In addition, we used the gain values to estimate the proximity between models generated and the species incidence points for each reproductive trait sampled. Higher gain values indicate greater proximity between models and sampled points [
