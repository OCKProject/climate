<p class="p">After slicing bioclimatic layers, we performed correlation tests to exclude bioclimatic variables (r &gt; 0.9) that were highly correlated either within or between the two climate models used (MIROC-ESM and CCSM4). Excluding strongly correlated variables ensures bioclimatic models with greater biological relevance for a regional set of species during the periods considered. In total, a set of eight bioclimatic variables were retained here: (1) isothermality (b3), (2) annual temperature range (b7), (3) mean temperature of warmest quarter (b10), (4) mean temperature of coldest quarter (b11), (5) precipitation seasonality (b15), (6) precipitation of driest quarter (b17), (7) precipitation of warmest quarter (b18) and (8) precipitation of coldest quarter (b19).</p>
