<p class="p">We used an algorithm based on the maximum entropy method to predict the most suitable habitat areas of plant species endemic to the Caatinga according to the reproductive traits considered using the Maxent v. 3.3 software [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. The maximum entropy method implemented in Maxent is adequate for presence-only data, as in the localities sampled in this study. In addition, Maxent performs better compared to other software modeling species distributions, when it considers presence-only species distribution data [
