<p class="p">Based on the generated models, we constructed maps of the areas with different habitat probability of the species of each functional group. For analytical purposes, we defined suitable habitat areas those with a high probability of occurrence (&gt;80%) for groups of endemic plant species with generalist or specialized reproductive strategies at each sample coordinate. The extent of suitable habitats was calculated separately for each trait. All modeling results were checked and edited using ArcGIS 10.0 software [
