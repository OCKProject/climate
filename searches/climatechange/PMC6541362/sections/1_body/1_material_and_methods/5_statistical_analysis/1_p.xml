<p class="p">To test whether suitable habitat areas for endemic species will be reduced by climate change, we compared the raw data among the current period and the two climate change scenarios using the one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Our second hypothesis—that reproductive trait specialization leads to greater vulnerability to climate-induced range contraction—was also tested using a two-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Since the extent of suitable habitats under the RCP scenarios is related to the current extent for most traits considered (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0217028.s003" class="xref">S3 Table</xref>), raw data were converted into percentage values to allow comparisons of suitable habitats between generalist and specialist traits among the current and future RCP scenarios. Specifically, we compared the extent of suitable habitats, based on percentage values, for trees and non-arboreous species, with either generalist or specialized pollination systems, abiotic or biotic dispersal modes, and self-compatible or obligatory cross-pollination (dioecious and self-incompatible reproductive systems). Tukey or Dunn posteriori tests were used to identify differences in the extent of suitable habitats for endemic species and their respective traits for all comparisons. We used Shapiro-Wilk and Bartlett tests, respectively, to check for normality of residuals and homogeneity of variances based on raw and percentage data in all cases. All analyses were performed within the R 3.3.1 environment [
