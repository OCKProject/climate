For the distribution modelling analysis, we grouped all species in each sample coordinate into two habit categories: (1) arboreous and (2) non-arboreous species (including other habits such as shrub, sub-shrub, herbaceous and scandent plants). Arboreous species were considered as a specialist habit due to growth and slow reproductive rate [
