<p class="p">Our hypotheses were based on this classification of generalization and specialization since this can elucidate significant diagnostics of species vulnerability to habitat changes mediated by human disturbances and climate change. Specifically, plant species bearing specialized reproductive strategies rely on the interactions with few species of pollinators or seed dispersers. Since habitat changes negatively affect populations of pollinators and seed dispersers, reproduction of plants with specialized reproductive strategies may be disproportionally affected in comparison to those with generalist strategies. The reproductive characterization of each species was based on: (1) botanical monographs and floras (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]), (2) web searches, including published and referenced data, (3) field observations and a survey of specimens from the UFP Herbarium, and (4) our own personal observations and communications. Although a few tree species were incompletely assigned to all life-history trait categories, this unlikely introduced biases to the between-trait comparisons as all scenarios were compared in terms of the proportion of species within categories.
