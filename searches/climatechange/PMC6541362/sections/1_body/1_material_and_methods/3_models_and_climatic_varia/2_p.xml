<p class="p">Climate models selected for the future in this study are projected as two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) scenarios, which are based on GHG emissions and the trajectory that GHGs will present [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. For each model, two RCP climate change scenarios were selected. The RCP4.5 scenario is intermediate (considering the four available RCP scenarios: 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 e 8.5, whereby RCP2.6 is the more optimistic and RCP8.5 is the most pessimistic), in relation to predicted GHG emissions, i.e. predicting milder changes in temperature, such as an average increase of 1.8°C. We selected the RCP4.5 instead of the RCP2.6 since the latter is a stringent mitigation scenario, which is rarely considered in other studies (see also [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]). The second selected scenario (RCP8.5) is the most pessimistic, predicting the highest GHG emissions, and a mean increase in terrestrial temperatures of 3.7°C [
