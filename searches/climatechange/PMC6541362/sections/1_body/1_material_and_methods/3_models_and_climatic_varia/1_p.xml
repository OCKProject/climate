<p class="p">The current climate was described on the basis of ecological modeling data and the georeferencing system of Worldclim 2.0 for the period 1970â€“2000. Climatic projections for the future, between 2070 and 2100, were obtained from the IPCC5 database calibrated according to current climate data from Worldclim 2.0. Initially, we used a package of 19 bioclimatic variables for each period, which are derived from average monthly temperature and precipitation, thereby representing greater biological relevance for simulations of species distributions [
