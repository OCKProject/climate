<p class="p">A list of endemic Caatinga angiosperm species was initially generated from the Flora do Brasil website [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>] using the following filters: "native of Brazil", "occurs only in the Northeast region", "occurs only in the phytogeographic domain of the Caatinga", "occurs only in the vegetation type of the Caatinga (
 <italic class="italic">stricto sensu</italic>)", thereby excluding rupestrian fields and altitude forest within the Caatinga, and "only endemic to Brazil". Using these search filters, 298 endemic species of angiosperms (now treated as plant species endemic to the Caatinga) were recorded.
