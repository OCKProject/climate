<p class="p">Here, we seek to understand the effects of climate change on the range and distribution of suitable habitats for flowering plants endemic to the Caatinga, in relation to growth habit (arboreous and non-arboreous) and reproductive traits (e.g. pollination, reproductive systems, dispersal mode). Thus, we used what Foden 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] very recently outlined as a trait-correlative approach for assessing the vulnerability of species to climate change. First, we test the hypothesis that areas with highly suitable climatic conditions for endemic flowering plants will be reduced under scenarios of climate change represented by increases in temperature and decreases in precipitation. We also test the hypothesis that elevated temperatures and reduced precipitation will promote greater reduction in the suitable habitat for endemic plants with arboreous habits and specialized reproductive strategies (e.g. vertebrate pollination, biotic dispersal, obligatory cross-pollination) compared to plants exhibiting other growth habits (i.e. non-arboreous) or generalist reproductive traits. Our predictions were that (
