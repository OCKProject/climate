 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. In this sense, they can be used as predictors of species responses to environmental changes, including changes in land use (e.g. habitat loss and fragmentation) [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. These traits are extremely important to consider the differential vulnerability of species to climate change since they ensure more robust (trait-based) models than studies based primarily on species distribution (correlative models) (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] for a review). The combination of trait-based models with correlative models may offer a good opportunity for a better understanding of species vulnerability to climate change (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>] and references therein for a review). Traits such as reduced dispersal capacity, slow reproductive rate (trees), pollination and dispersal by bats, specialized diet or habitat, narrow physiological tolerance range, low adaptive potential, restricted distribution, and population rarity, among others, can all render a species more vulnerable to climate change (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]). In general, species with specialist life history traits (i.e. traits with some degree of ecological specificity/restriction 
 <italic class="italic">sensu</italic> [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]), such as those cited above, play a key role in ecosystem processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Many studies have shown that these traits/strategies are mainly observed in endemic species or species showing some level of vulnerability (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]). The vast majority of these studies (~70%) were developed in North America, Europe or Australia. Neotropical regions, which hold most of the global biodiversity, including endemic species, have been therefore neglected [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Angiosperms, birds and mammals are the most studied taxonomic groups [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and forecasts suggest severe species losses in these taxa globally [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], particularly in biodiversity hotspots [
 <xref rid="pone.0217028.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], and mainly specialist species [
