In South America, novel climate-vegetation equilibrium conditions are predicted, in which savannas may replace some tropical rainforest areas and semi-desert areas may replace much of the drought polygon of northeastern Brazil (geographic polygon bound by the annual 800-mm isohyet) [

In response to these emergent climatic conditions, species may persist within their original distribution range due to acclimatization and phenotypic plasticity, migrate to new areas of suitable climatic conditions, or may undergo local extinctions (e.g. [
