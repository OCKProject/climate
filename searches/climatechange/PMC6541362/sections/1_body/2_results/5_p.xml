Reduced suitable habitats was observed for only those species with abiotic dispersal modes. However, when compared to species with biotic dispersal, species with abiotic dispersal modes retained larger areas of suitable habitats under both the current and future (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) scenarios (H = 87.421; df = 5; P &lt; 0.0001;
