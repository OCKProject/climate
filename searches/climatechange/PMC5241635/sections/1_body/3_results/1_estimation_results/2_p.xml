 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> shows how the predicted crop shares vary with temperature for three different precipitation cases. There we see (1) Spring wheat and hay are most likely to be chosen in places with low precipitation, with corn most likely under moderate or high precipitation. (2) In higher temperature instances, sorghum is favored under low precipitation, but cotton is more likely to be planted under moderate and high precipitation. (3) As precipitation goes up, the most selected crop in moderate temperature change from winter wheat to soybeans. Hay, winter wheat, spring wheat and sorghum are more likely to be chosen in drier regions, and corn, soybeans and cotton are more likely to be selected in wetter regions.
