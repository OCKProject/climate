<p class="p">The average partial effects of the independent variables computed from the estimated model appear in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The results show: (1) The acreage shares of all major crops are affected by changes in temperature and precipitation. Upland cotton, rice, sorghum and winter wheat are more likely to be chosen when the 5-year average temperature increases. On the other hand, barley, corn, soybeans, spring wheat and alfalfa hay are less likely to be chosen when the temperature increases. When annual precipitation increases, land use shares for corn, upland cotton, rice and soybeans increase while shares for barley, sorghum, hay and both types of wheat decline; (2) Increases in the annual standard deviation of temperature reduces the share of barley, rice, winter wheat and hay, while larger standard deviations for precipitation decrease the shares for corn, cotton and hay. (3) The crop mix shares positively respond to increases in own crop net returns. (4) Mixed effects occur when human population density increases, with barley, corn and soybeans increasing. (5) As total planted area increases, cotton, rice, soybeans, winter wheat and spring wheat shares grow. For instance, in Corn Belt regions with relatively cold temperature, fluent precipitation and high irritation rate, corn is likely to be more chosen than other crops although the non-linear relationships between variables indicate that too high or low values of climate variables have limitations to the degrees of changes.
