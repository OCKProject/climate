<p class="p">In terms of longitude, the estimations show climate is responsible for between 7% and 50% for all crops but rice and sorghum. For rice, the estimated model predicts shifts in the opposite directions in comparison to observed estimates with over-prediction of the estimate for sorghum. For latitude, the model evaluation explains 20â€“36% of the northward movement in hay, corn, soybeans and winter wheat but missed the direction of movement for barley, cotton, rice, sorghum and spring wheat. For elevation, the model extrapolations shows climate is responsible for between 4% and 28% of the upward movements for all crops but rice and sorghum where it misses the direction.</p>
