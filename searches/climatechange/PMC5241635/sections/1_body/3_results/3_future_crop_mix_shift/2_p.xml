 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> shows the patterns on a US map. In terms of latitude, mixed changes are shown as alfalfa hay, barley and soybeans are expected to move to the generally drier western regions while corn, cotton, rice, sorghum, winter wheat and spring wheat move east. Under the RCP 4.5 scenario, there is not much adjustment. Cotton and rice move northward and lower in elevation (26.4% to 41.4% and −16.4% to −25.5%, respectively), while soybeans and spring wheat are likely to move north and lower moderately (7.4% to 12.4% and −7.3% to −7.9%).
