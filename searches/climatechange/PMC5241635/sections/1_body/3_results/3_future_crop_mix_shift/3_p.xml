<p class="p">Almost all of the major crops in the US in both 2020–2050 and 2060–2090 periods show the pattern of moving north (colder areas) under both RCP scenarios. Rice is the exception moving south although to a small degree (−0.5% to −0.6%). Also all crops except for rice and barley move further north under RCP 8.5 than under RCP 4.5.</p>
