 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref> examined historical shifts in major US crops arguing that climate change is a causal factor. Examining crop mixes gives a sense of adaptation as land use shifts away from more vulnerable crops. In fact looking at individual crops one at a time in climate change analysis can be misleading. While simulation studies like Rosenzweig and Parry
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref> or econometric studies like Schlenker and Roberts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref> show concern about crop yield vulnerability, they overstate agricultural vulnerability since producers can adapt by shifting crop mix. Although land value studies like those by Mendelsohn 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> implicitly treat adaptations including crop mix shifts, they do not address what crops may shift. Foreseeing such shifts is a factor in planning of future transportation, processing capacity and other infrastructure (see the findings in Attavanich
