<p class="p">The independent variables not only involve climate characteristics but also revenue by crop, land capability, human population density, total planted acres, average elevation and proportion of irrigated land. The climate attributes involve annual average temperature and annual total precipitation in linear and squared form plus monthly standard deviations of temperature and precipitation. Additionally, the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) was used with negative values indicating dry conditions and positive values indicating wet ones. Most of the independent variables were formed as lagged 5-year averages in an attempt to model farmer reactions to longer term climate and other effects. Time-invariant factors include land capability and average elevation of lands for each county.</p>
