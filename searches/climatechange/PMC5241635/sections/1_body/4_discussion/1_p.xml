<p class="p">This study examined how climate affects crop mix. To do so, we estimated how land area shares by crop are affected by climate, socioeconomic factors, and crop revenue. We find that when the annual temperature goes up, the overall proportions of cotton, rice, sorghum, and winter wheat are likely to increase with barley, corn, soybeans and spring wheat declining. We also find that increased precipitation reduces barley, sorghum, hay, and all types of wheat but increases corn, rice, and soybeans. Our results show that increasing inter-annual standard deviations of climate variables are likely to reduce the proportions for some crops: barley, rice, winter wheat and hay by larger temperature variations and corn, cotton and hay by larger precipitation variations. The results describe how farmersâ€™ adaptation strategies for crop allocations change under altering climate.</p>
