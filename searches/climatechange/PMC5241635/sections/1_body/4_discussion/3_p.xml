<p class="p">Although we estimated the crop mix allocations affected by various factors, there might be some omitted variables to explain the changes. We assumed that farmers are risk-neutral price takers in crop land allocations and crop yield is stable over time. Furthermore, although our results include the existing crops, we do not explain some recent crops not settled in the past. Also, we did not explicitly model agronomic managements by farmers and state-specific agricultural policies. Thus, further research would be better conducted by considering explicit policy impacts, spillover effects, and flexible model to include newly introduced crops as well as dynamic crop yields.</p>
