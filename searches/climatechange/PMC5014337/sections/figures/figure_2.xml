  <title class="title">Significant predictors of student belief in human causes of global warming (n = 369).</title>
  <p class="p">Student belief scale included 1 (nothing causes global warming because it is not happening), 2 (belief in human causes), 3 (belief in human and natural causes), and 4 (belief in human causes over natural causes). Predicted values were derived from model 2 in 
   <xref rid="pone.0161462.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. Low and high values of teacher belief in GW and student CC knowledge reflect the predictions for the 10
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 90
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentiles, respectively. Accordingly, larger differences between two values indicate larger effects sizes, with all other variables held constant. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals.
