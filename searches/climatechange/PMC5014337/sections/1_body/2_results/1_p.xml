Thus only 12% of students were associated with teachers whose views on climate change causes matched the scientific consensus that global warming is caused mostly by human activities (

Smaller percentages of students thought that global warming was happening (81.8%), but a greater percentage (30.2%) thought that climate change is mostly caused by humans. Students scored an average of 12.8 out of a maximum of 19 on the climate change knowledge scale (SD = 2.73). For mean values for each question in the climate knowledge scale please see Tables
