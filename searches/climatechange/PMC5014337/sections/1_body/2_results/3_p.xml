 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], we explored the possibility of collinearity between teacher beliefs. We found these variables significantly, but weakly correlated (r = 0.24, p &lt;0.001). We ran the same regression models reported in this study with the teacher belief that global warming is happening variable omitted and teacher belief in human causes for climate change remained a non-significant variable in models predicting both student belief that climate change was happening and student belief that climate change had human causes.
