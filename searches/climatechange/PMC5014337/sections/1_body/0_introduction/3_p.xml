<p class="p">Despite the role that politics seems to play in how climate change is addressed in science classrooms, research on how students learn about climate change is more encouraging. Among adults, worldview and political ideology seem to be primary drivers of climate change beliefs [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], and education level and scientific literacy may further entrench people into their ideologically-based beliefs [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Among adolescents, however, worldview is associated with polarized climate change beliefs at low levels of climate change understanding, but climate education appears to eliminate ideological differences once adolescents understand key scientific concepts associated with climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Although changing climate change perceptions among adults may be difficult because of the strong influence of worldviews and political ideology [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], educational interventions may be effective among adolescents at fostering climate change knowledge, belief in anthropogenic global warming, behavioral intentions and reported behavior around climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. This research points to the possibility that although teacher beliefs may influence how climate change is presented in the classroom [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], younger audiences may be able to better separate scientific evidence from its politically driven context.
