<p class="p">Gaps between teachers’ knowledge about climate science and the scientific consensus of anthropogenic global warming are concerning when considering the importance of climate change education in schools. A 2016 national survey of US teachers found that although a vast majority of middle and high school science teachers (70% and 87%, respectively), dedicate at least an hour of instruction to climate change, 30% emphasize that global warming is due to natural causes and 31% teach “both sides” (i.e., that recent global warming is due to human activity but that many scientists think it is due to natural causes)[

Similarly, less than half of teachers (30% of middle school science teachers and 45% of science teachers) responded to the correct proportion of climate scientists who think global warming is caused mostly by human activities [

Perhaps the most troubling aspect of this study was that teachers’ political ideology was the most powerful predictor of their classroom approach [

This would suggest that the biggest determinant of how our children are presented information about climate change in science classrooms is driven by a factor that is incredibly hard to change and largely independent from science [
