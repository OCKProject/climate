<p class="p">Although climate change knowledge may more directly influence beliefs among adolescents than among adults, other insights on adolescent perceptions of climate change suggest that socio-cultural factors such as gender, ethnicity, and descriptive norms may shape climate change beliefs, raising questions about the relative importance of teacher climate change beliefs on those of their students. Several studies have shown gender effects around adolescent perception of climate change, with girls more concerned about climate change than boys [

 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] and suggest that gender-related social norms may influence how young children relate to climate change. Similarly consistent with studies among adults [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], non-White adolescents were also found to have higher levels of acceptance of anthropogenic global warming than Whites [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Among adults, the explanation for this difference may be rooted in environmental justice issues, with non-White populations disproportionally exposed to the negative effects of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. It is possible, even likely, that children adopt the perspectives of their parents or even recognize their own vulnerability to climate change. Other studies suggest that descriptive norms may play an important role in forming climate change beliefs. In one study, perceived skepticism among parents and peers were the most important predictors of climate change skepticism among adolescents, over political and value orientations, subjective knowledge, and self-efficacy [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. In another, teens whose parents had high climate change risk perceptions were more likely to seek information about climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], suggesting that parent beliefs drive behaviors among their children. Evidence for these socio-cultural drivers of climate change beliefs along with evidence that teachers can spur climate change engagement [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] suggest that just as parents and peer beliefs influence adolescent climate change perceptions, teacher climate change beliefs may also the climate change beliefs of their students.
