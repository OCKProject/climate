 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Researchers attribute this persistent disconnect between scientific consensus and public perceptions to individualsâ€™ heavy reliance on worldview and political ideology, which drive individuals to seek information from ideologically compatible sources [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>] and shape their interpretation of new information [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Although worldview and political ideology are the overwhelming drivers of climate change perceptions [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], some research does suggest that climate-specific knowledge can predict acceptance of anthropogenic global warming as well as climate change concern among adolescents [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and adults [

 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>], indicating that climate education may have the potential to overcome ideologically-driven polarization. However, a recent survey of U.S. science teachers suggests that climate literacy is low and polarization is high among the very people who have the potential to leverage education to unite public opinion [
