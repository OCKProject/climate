<p class="p">In this study we tested four hypotheses about how teachers’ beliefs regarding climate change influence the beliefs of their students with a case study in North Carolina, USA: 1–2) teacher belief that climate change is happening would positively impact student belief that climate change is happening and human caused, and 3–4) teacher belief that climate change is human caused would positively impact student belief that climate change is happening and human caused. We used middle school subjects in our case study since middle school students are developmentally able to grasp complex issues such as climate change [

Additionally, we focused on coastal North Carolina counties for our study since people in coastal areas are more apt to perceive threats of climate change since they will likely be most directly affected by climate change impacts such as sea level rise and loss of coastline [

Further, as we are interested in how politically-driven climate change beliefs of teachers may impact beliefs of students, we chose North Carolina because of the highly politicized context surrounding discourse related to sea level rise, climate change, and climate education [
