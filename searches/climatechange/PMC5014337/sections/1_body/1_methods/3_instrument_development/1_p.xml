<p class="p">To measure student and teacher beliefs in AGW, we used two items from one of the only published instruments used with both adult and adolescent populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. One item measured whether students and teachers thought GW was happening and another measured whether they thought it was human caused (
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). We measured climate change knowledge among students with a modified version of the climate knowledge scale in Tobler et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], which addresses climate science, causes, and impacts (
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). We pretested this instrument with 92 middle school students as outlined in Stevenson et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0161462.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. We asked students to give written and verbal feedback when taking the instrument and conducted nine cognitive interviews [
