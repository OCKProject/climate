<p class="p">Using STATA version 14.1, we used multiple linear regression to model student beliefs that GW is happening and human caused as a function of teacher belief that GW is happening and teacher belief that GW is human caused. We also controlled for student climate change knowledge as predictors and controlled for student gender and race. We compared both ethnicity and race in our sample to student population data available through the NC Department of Public Instruction. Because we found our sample underrepresented males (45.2% in our sample versus 51.0% in coastal NC; t = 2.85, p = 0.005), we weighted our sample to adjust for this difference.</p>
