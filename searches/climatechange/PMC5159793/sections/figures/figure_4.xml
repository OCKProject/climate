  <title class="title">Percent change of vector potential distribution and potential for human exposure to vectors under present-day and future climate.</title>
  <p class="p">Present-day models were compared against future climate by 2030 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>), 2050 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), and 2100 (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) in terms of area (
   <italic class="italic">x</italic> axis) and human population at risk of exposure (
   <italic class="italic">y</italic> axis). Top right quadrant (pink) denotes an increase in vectors’ range and human population at risk. Bottom-right (green) resembles an increase in range, but reduction in the number of humans exposed. Bottom-left (blue) denotes reduction in vectors’ range and reduction in population predicted at risk. Top-left (yellow) denotes increase in human populations at risk, but reduction in the vector’s range. Zero means no change.
