  <title class="title">Ecological modeling approach used to assess disease vector speciesâ€™ potential distributions.</title>
  <p class="p">The ecological niche of each vector species was estimated (red ellipsoid) based on present-day environmental conditions (
   <italic class="italic">E</italic>). The environments available in Ecuador were determined under present-day (yellow square) and future (orange square) climate conditions. Areas with climatic conditions in Ecuador overlapping between the niche of vectors and both present-day and future climate conditions were identified as Risk A (risk under present-day and future scenario; red). Areas of Ecuador with climate under present-day overlapping with the niche of vectors were defined as Risk B (risk under present-day only; pink). Areas with overlap between the niche of vectors and future climate in Ecuador only were defined as Risk C (risk under future climate only; brown). (Figure created using Adobe Photoshop CC 2014
