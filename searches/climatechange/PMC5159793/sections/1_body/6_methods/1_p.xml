<p class="p">We forecasted the distribution of disease vectors under present-day conditions and future climate in Ecuador using vector records across their entire global ranges from data of museum collections and literature. After vector occurrence data curation, we developed ecological niche models for each vector species in Maxent
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>, assuming that each species record originated from a stable vector population instead of migratory or accidentally translocated individuals. We assessed regularization coefficients and model complexity in Maxent
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. Our model evaluation was based on information theory through assessing Akaike information criterion (AIC) values to explore model fit with the data available
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>, which provides robustness to our model assessment procedure, a key factor when modeling infectious diseases
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Thus, AIC is a well-known method to discriminate among models, especially when working with the Maxent algorithm employed in our study
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. Additionally, using Maxent we estimated the Area Under the Curve of the Receiver Operating Characteristic values as this metric is commonly employed to assess the specificity and sensitivity of models. The final models, calibrated on each speciesâ€™ entire range, were projected to Ecuador under present-day and future climatic conditions using strict model transference

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. Potential distribution of vectors were forecasted under present-day conditions using remote sensing imagery including EVI time series data and land surface temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>, and precipitation values from field stations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>, while future climate models where calibrated in present-day climate and then projected to future climate conditions, based on data of the CliMond repository
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>. We used the SRES A2 scenario (Special Report on Emissions Scenarios) of future climatic conditions given that Latin America has increasing populations, economic development, per capita economic growth, but also relatively fragmented and slow technological change and limited abilities to mitigate greenhouse effects
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>, and considering that the last IPPC assessment concluded that there are not important improvements to reduce emissions worldwide
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. Indeed, since the first future climate scenarios, the more optimistic low-emission scenarios have become implausible given the ongoing empirical trends in emissions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42" class="xref">42</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43" class="xref">43</xref>. The A2 scenario is equivalent to the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 proposed in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. Additionally, we developed non-analogous environment evaluations using the Mobility Oriented Parity test (MOP) script in R
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref> to ensure that future predictions were restricted to regions in Ecuador with analogous climates somewhere in range of each species, to avoid extrapolation uncertainties. The final maps were used to identify the percentage of area predicted as suitable in each climate scenario. We used the LandScan human population estimates for year 2011 at 1-km spatial resolution
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44" class="xref">44</xref> to estimate the people living within the suitable areas for a given vector species. Estimation based on current climates was compared with models of future climate conditions to establish the percent of change among climate scenarios.
