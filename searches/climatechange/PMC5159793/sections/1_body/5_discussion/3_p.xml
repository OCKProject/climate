<p class="p">Our models were based on a broad-scale biogeographic approach
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>, therefore we did not consider microclimatic conditions at local scale and avoided the complexities and uncertainties of including factors such as biological interactions in the modeling
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. We accounted for the environmental tolerances of vector species from vector records across the entire global distribution of each species. This framework should reduce the risk of incomplete niche estimation (niche truncation) due to failure to represent the full niche space for a species in the model calibration
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>, i.e., by including records from as wide areas in geographic and environmental space as possible (e.g., the entire species range). Thus, for species of broad distributions (e.g., global), making models with data from the areas of interest only (e.g., Ecuador) could capture a limited portion of the species’ ecological niche generating an incomplete characterization of the species’ environmental tolerances. Models calibrated using a subset of the species’ range will generate sub-estimations of the species’ ecological niche and in turn sub-estimations of its potential distribution.
