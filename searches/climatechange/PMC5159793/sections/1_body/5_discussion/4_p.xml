<p class="p">The future climate forecasts used in this study (A2; 2030, 2050, 2100) are realistic scenarios of the environmental conditions that may be present in Ecuador given the ongoing trends in greenhouse gas emissions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Predictions in future climate scenarios showed a likely expansion of exposure risk of all pathogens to populations in the highlands of Ecuadorian Andean regions. The geomorphology and latitudinal position of Ecuador may suggest similar predictions for other tropical regions. Although potential range shifts and extinction have been reported for the future distribution of several plant and animal species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>, we complement this information with the potentially negative effects of climate change on range contraction, displacement, and extirpation of vectors species, and an overview of changes in patterns of human populations at risk for Ecuador. These estimates were based on the assumption of niche conservatism of vector species
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>. By supporting this assumption, our findings provide information to anticipate strategies to reduce the burden of vector-borne diseases via increasing the awareness in areas currently disease-free, but predicted vulnerable to vectors displacement. An early warning scheme in Andean region should be formulated with inclusion of non-endemic vector species given risk predicted in highlands and the limited understanding of the colonization capacity of vectors in face of climate change. Preventive measures can contribute globally to the early detection and prevention of vector-borne diseases in highlands worldwide in face of global warming. Despite the local benefits of reduced transmission due to the extinction of specific vector species, range shifts of other vectors could increase vector-borne diseases incidence and spread, resulting in epidemiological surprises
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Based on our mixed results of positive and negative effects of future climate on human exposure to disease vectors, we argue that research on vector-borne diseases in face of future environmental change should be cross-scale and include climatic, demographic, and landscape factors, as well as forces facilitating disease transmission acting at fine scales. Importantly, care should be take that vector-borne disease research on climate change effects will not discourage health agencies from research into understanding local transmission processes and implementing control measures for critical threats of disease transmission at the local level including human behavior and habitat destruction.
