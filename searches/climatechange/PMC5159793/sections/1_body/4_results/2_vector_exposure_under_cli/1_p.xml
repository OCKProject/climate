<p class="p">The general pattern revealed that human populations in the Andean highlands would be increasingly exposed to disease vectors as the future climate changes unfold due to likely upward vector species range shifts (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, we found that the equatorial latitudes of Ecuador show just a slight northward range shift, with strong upward altitudinal displacements into the Andes Mountains. Importantly, across all 14 vector species we found consistent non-artefactual reductions in potential range area and people potentially exposed for nine vector species by 2030, 2050, or 2100, with the malaria vectors
