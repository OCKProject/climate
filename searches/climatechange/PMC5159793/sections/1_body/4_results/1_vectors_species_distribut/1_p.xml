<p class="p">Our ecological niche models were able to accurately characterize environmental conditions for each vector (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The results show that present-day predictions based on remote sensing data reveal areas of high risk for exposure to arboviruses vectors across the coastal region of western Ecuador and in the Amazonian lowlands in the northeast. Additional areas of exposure risk to vectors were found across valleys of the western region of the Andes mountains (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Climate-based predictions suggest an increased risk in southern areas in the short term (i.e., 2030). Mid-term predictions suggest that by 2050 high risk will be distributed in the coast, southern lowlands and in northeastern areas neighboring Colombia and Peru, with reduced suitability in central areas across the Andes. Models for 2100 for the arbovirus vectors 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>, showed an evident geographic shift in the suitable areas, with increased risk for exposure in the Andes valleys. 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> should experience a reduction in its potential area of distribution by 69%, 43%, and 48% and population at risk by 84%, 47%, 40% by 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively. For 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>, the potential area of distribution should be reduced by 45%, 35%, and 53% and the number of people potentially exposed by 58%, 46%, and 52% in 2030, 2050, and 2100, respectively (
