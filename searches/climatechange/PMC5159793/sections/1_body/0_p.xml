<p class="p">More than half of the world’s population is at risk of vector-borne diseases
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, causing public health concerns due to elevated mortality and high levels of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Vector-borne diseases are currently a major problem in tropical developing countries
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Climate variability influences vector population dynamics, distribution, and vector-borne disease transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Dengue transmission is associated in space and time with local climate effects on survival of its vector 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>—more rain and higher temperature generates more transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Changes in inter-annual climate variability such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation have been shown to be important drivers for malaria transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. Further, vectors also show distributional shifts from low to high altitudes during warm years
