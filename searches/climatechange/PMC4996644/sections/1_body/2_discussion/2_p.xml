<p class="p">Global economic damage, measured as agricultural welfare loss, can reach the annual amount of roughly 0.8% of projected GDP at the end of the century if the international trade is inelastic at 1995 patterns over the simulation period (1995â€“2095). This estimate can be seen as the high-end value of agro-economic damage, in a scenario with strong climate change without CO

 </xref>). Similarly, trade liberalization could not only stall but also deteriorate to an even more restrictive regime than that of 1995. By gradually liberalizing trade, this damage can be reduced by approximately 65% (that is, to 0.3% of GDP or a loss equal to 6.8% of agricultural GDP on the basis of the estimated 4.2% share of agricultural GDP in total GDP at the end of the century; table S9). The importance of trade in determining impacts on prices, and consequently on welfare, is clearly demonstrated in our analysis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). However, given the difficulties in defining a metric that works for both drivers, it is hard to conclude if trade regimes are more important than climate change or vice versa, or if the relative importance of trade and climate change simply reflects how different the scenarios for each driver are. To contrast the importance of trade impacts against the importance of climate impacts, one would need to use a wider range of trade scenarios and corresponding climate change projections to obtain a robust insight on relevance rank of both drivers.
