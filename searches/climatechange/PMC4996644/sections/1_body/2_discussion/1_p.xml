<p class="p">We find that high-end climate change impacts on crop yields lead to increasingly negative impacts on global agricultural welfare toward the end of the 21st century because consumer losses outweigh producer benefits. However, those impacts could decrease in magnitude with slower future demographic development, reduced climate change impacts, or reduction in demand in agricultural markets, or they could even be offset if positive atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects on crop yields can be realized at large scales. Global warming and free trade favor agricultural production at higher latitudes and benefit agricultural welfare there despite increasing domestic prices and losses in consumer surplus. Still, positive impacts on total agricultural welfare in EUR and FSU are subject to large uncertainties from climate change projections (GCMs).
