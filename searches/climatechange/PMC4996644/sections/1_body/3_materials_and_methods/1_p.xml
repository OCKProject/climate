 </xref>). On the basis of a regional demand for agricultural products and biophysical endowments on a regular geographic 0.5° × 0.5° grid resolution, the model generates optimal land use patterns by minimizing global production costs. The recursive dynamic nature of the model is reflected in a 10-year time-step optimization from 1995 to 2095 through the linkage between optimal land use patterns from the previous period that are taken as a starting point for the current period. The initial period is calibrated to the arable area reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). At the top level, MAgPIE operates on 10 socioeconomic regions. The demand for food is regionally defined and given as an exogenous trend to the model, encompassing 16 crop and 5 livestock types. The estimates for calorie intake for each region are obtained from a country cross-sectional regression analysis on population and GDP (

 </xref>). The future demand projections are based on the SRES scenario storylines. In addition to food, the agricultural demand consists also of feed, material, and bioenergy demand. Feed demand is based on feed baskets defined for each livestock production activity and depends on regional efficiencies, whereas the material demand is implemented in proportion with food demand. In this model setting, we account for first-generation bioenergy demand, which is established on current land-based fuel production policy targets (second-generation bioenergy demand is omitted in this analysis).
