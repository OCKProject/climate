 </xref>). The distribution of climate change impacts on economic surpluses is consequently determined not only by the spatial features of climatic change and its impact on crop yields but also by the response of global land use patterns and trade, as well as the balancing of consumer and producer surplus (gains and losses). If food prices increase because of climate change impacts, households not only will have to spend more income on food consumption but also could face a risk of nutritional shortage and insufficient access to food (
