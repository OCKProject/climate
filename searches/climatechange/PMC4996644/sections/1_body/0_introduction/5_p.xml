<p class="p">To fulfill the demand for agricultural commodities under climate-impacted productivity, we endogenously estimate the most cost-effective combination of shifting the production to higher-yielding areas, including land expansion into forest and other natural vegetation area, and investments in yield-increasing technologies (research and development), which intensifies production on existing cropland. As a prominent adaptation measure, we assess the effectiveness of global trade liberalization and its adaptive potential to reduce the pressure caused by climate change on the agricultural sector. The liberalized (LIB) trade scenario in our analysis resembles current trade liberalization trends (

The “fixed” (FIX) trade scenario assumes that the interregional trade patterns, in terms of relative shares of regional trade flows, are fixed at levels that are the same as those in year 1995 (see the Supplementary Materials). The FIX trade scenario should not be seen as a baseline scenario because current trade is already substantially liberalized. In contrast, it should be seen as a counterfactual scenario that allows the estimation of the benefits of trade according to competitiveness. Trade regulations are included into the model in the form of regional self-sufficiency constraints. These can be interpreted as being equivalent to quotas for domestic supply, such that government revenues or spending from trade policies (for example, tariffs or subsidies) are not explicitly estimated but become part of consumer or producer rents.
