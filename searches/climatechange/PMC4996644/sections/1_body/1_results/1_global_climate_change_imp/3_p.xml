<p class="p">Trade liberalization is also a suitable measure to prepare for the uncertainty in climate change, especially with respect to the uncertainty in spatial patterns of climate change impacts. Uncertainty in the LIB trade scenario is considerably reduced because of the adaptive potential of trade. In a world with liberalized trade, it is easier to respond to climate change impacts, and especially to impacts from extreme weather events and subsequent fluctuations in agricultural production, by spatially reallocating agricultural production. Moreover, all climate scenarios in the LIB scenario are almost certain in the sign of the impact (after 2065) measured by all indicators, that is, producer surplus is always positive, whereas consumer surplus and overall agricultural welfare are always negative (red shaded area in

On the other hand, the uncertainty in the FIX scenario is much larger because spatial differences in GCM climate projections contribute to the substantial uncertainty in the magnitude of impacts if regional production patterns are inflexible to respond.
