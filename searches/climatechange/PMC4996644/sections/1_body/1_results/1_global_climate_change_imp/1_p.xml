<p class="p">In both trade scenarios, climate change causes mostly positive trends in global producer surplus and negative trends in global consumer surplus toward the end of the century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). As a result of climate change, crop yields decrease in many areas, and producers are compelled to intensify production and/or expand cultivated areas, which leads to a rise in marginal cost of production compared to the reference scenario where no climate change occurs. As a consequence, the agricultural market responds with higher commodity prices, enabling producers to gain on average. On the other hand, consumers will have to pay more for the same basket of goods, and thus lose part of their surplus. Overall, consumers’ losses exceed producers’ benefits, creating the negative trend in agricultural welfare; this result is also consistent with other studies (
