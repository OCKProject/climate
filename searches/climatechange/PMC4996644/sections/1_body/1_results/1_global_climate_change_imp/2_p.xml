<p class="p">Averaged across all 19 GCM scenarios, there is a small positive climate change effect on global agricultural welfare in the beginning of the simulated period, reaching approximately 0.1% of global GDP (projected in SRES A2) in the year 2015 in the LIB and FIX trade scenario (US$34 billion and US$37 billion, respectively; table S1). Therefore, initial moderate levels of change in temperature and precipitation patterns, especially in temperate zones, can reduce the cost of agricultural production, having a positive effect on global agricultural welfare. The positive relative change is slightly stronger in the FIX scenario because it is very much constrained by fixed trade patterns, creating higher production costs, and therefore, beneficial warming would lead to a marginally bigger drop in prices compared to that in the LIB scenario (

As negative climate change impacts on crop yields intensify over time, the impacts on aggregate agricultural welfare become adverse after 2030, arriving at the loss of 0.3% of projected global GDP in the LIB scenario (US$884 billion) and 0.8% in the FIX scenario (US$2502 billion) in the year 2095 (table S1). Hence, in the LIB case where international trade becomes almost entirely free by the end of the century (table S2), global agricultural welfare losses in 2095 can be avoided by around 65% compared to the counterfactual scenario where trade is restricted to the 1995 pattern.
