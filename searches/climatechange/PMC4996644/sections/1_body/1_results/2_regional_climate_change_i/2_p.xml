<p class="p">On the other hand, if the regional relative agricultural import and export shares are kept constant to historic shares (FIX), impacts of climate change become more accentuated between the individual regions. For the regions in higher latitudes, climatic change does not pose a serious long-term risk to agricultural welfare. Most of these are exporting regions by historical trade patterns, most dominantly NAM, followed by EUR, and, after the mid-century, by PAO. In exporting regions, potential positive impacts on welfare are typically distributed to producers who profit from increased demand driven by global population change and from rising agricultural prices. This, in turn, has an adverse effect on domestic prices because domestic marginal cost of production rises with augmented domestic production for exports. The magnitude of loss in consumer surplus in the exporting regions is almost equivalent to the gain in producer surplus, resulting in a negligible impact on total agricultural welfare in these regions. Consumers benefit only if a region is not a net exporter, and climate change positively influences domestic production (for example, FSU).</p>
