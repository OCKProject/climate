<p class="p">Unlike higher-latitude regions, the exporting regions in lower latitudes in the FIX scenario, such as LAM, experience more severe climate change impacts on crop yields, and as a consequence, the magnitude of loss in consumer surplus outweighs potential benefits on the producersâ€™ side, reflecting increasing domestic prices. The same dynamics are observed for other tropical and subtropical regions that are more import-oriented. The most dominant negative impacts on agricultural welfare occur in MEA and SAS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>, figs. S4 and S5, and tables S3 to S5). Both regions are characterized by significant biophysical limitations for agricultural production (land and water), and if trade barriers are high, increasing agricultural demand will put further pressure on the supply side. Already in 2045, the climate change damage in these regions will account for 1.2 and 1.4% of their assumed GDP and, by the end of the century, will reach 4.6 and 3.1%, respectively. Other importing regions in the FIX scenario follow with negative climate change impacts but to a lesser extent, with the loss in agricultural welfare attributed to climate change ranging from 0.6% of regional GDP in CPA to 1.3% of that in AFR.
