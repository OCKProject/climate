<p class="p">Also at the regional level, liberalization of trade appears to represent a good adaptation option to climate change in agriculture. Compared to the welfare losses in the FIX trade scenario, economic climate change impacts can be abated by liberalized trade for almost all regions throughout the entire century. Regions in the northern hemisphere, where agricultural production is often constrained by cold temperatures, profit from climate change and liberalized trade because their export increases faster than that in the FIX trade scenario. Consumers in tropical and subtropical regions benefit the most in the LIB scenario. Although the level of consumer surplus will still decrease with intensifying climate change, the loss is considerably reduced in contrast to that in the FIX scenario. Furthermore, big importing regions, such as MEA and SAS, substantially abate climatic impacts on agricultural welfare by taking advantage of lower global agricultural prices compared to the prices under the FIX scenario. They lose 1.1 and 1.5% of their projected GDP in 2095, respectively. Opening up to the world market dampens domestic prices through increased regional import for some goods, which then reduces the amount of the same goods produced locally and cuts producer surplus. Historically exporting regions in the low latitudes, such as LAM and PAO (fig. S3), see stronger climate change impact on agricultural activities and gradually lose their share in the global market in the LIB scenario because excess agricultural production is displaced to more favorable regions.</p>
