<p class="p">Climate change increases the prices for consumers independently of a trade regime in international agricultural commerce (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), affecting almost all regions with negative change in consumer surplus. Distinctively for liberalized markets (LIB), a large part of the agricultural production is shifted to the northern temperate zones under climate change, mainly because of improving environmental conditions for agriculture (fig. S1) and increased comparative advantage (export is more than doubled in high-latitude regions NAM, EUR, and FSU compared to the scenario without climate change, reaching ~160% larger aggregate export volume in 2095; fig. S3), implying that producers in these regions can thus benefit more strongly, entirely compensating the loss in consumer surplus. For example, in EUR and FSU (see caption of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and the Supplementary Materials for the regional acronyms), the created added value for the agricultural sector in 2095 accounts for approximately 0.5 and 1.3% of projected regional GDP, respectively (US$100 billion each), and around 0.5% of projected regional GDP in NAM (US$60 billion) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and table S3). Regions at lower latitudes lose in agricultural welfare, where total damage in terms of loss of projected GDP ranges from −1.5% in SAS to −0.5% in PAS (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and table S3). These losses are driven by the opposite dynamics, reduced market shares, and thus lower production and producer surplus, but similar reductions in consumer surplus as in the high-latitude regions, because domestic prices are dominated by the world market price under LIB trade scenarios.
