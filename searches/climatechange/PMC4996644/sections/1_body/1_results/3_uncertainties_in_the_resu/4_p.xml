Variations in yield projections among global gridded crop models (GGCMs), such as LPJmL, which is used in this analysis, stem not only from different modeling approaches but also from a choice of representing important biochemical processes and parameterizations that are crucial for plant growth (
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">5</italic>
 </xref>). We compare the results from the LPJmL-MAgPIE modeling suite by deriving MAgPIE simulations with biophysical climate change impact projections on crop yields from four other GGCMs for the SRES A2 socioeconomic scenario but with only one climate scenario (GCM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref> and table S8). The uncertainty in magnitude of impacts across different GGCMs is considerable (0.1 to 1.7% loss of projected global GDP in 2085 in the LIB scenario); however, the general patterns are robust against the choice of GGCM. The magnitude of impacts strongly depends on the choice of GGCM and, most prominently, on the assumption of the effectiveness of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>). Here, we contrast results from two crop models that account for the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect: LPJmL and pDSSAT (parallel Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) (
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <italic class="italic">36</italic>
 </xref>). Both crop models indicate that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effects could more than counterbalance the welfare losses compared to cases when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect is not considered. The maximal compensation of losses happens around mid-century (144 and 124% offset in 2045 for LPJmL and pDSSAT, respectively) when CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization contributes to overall positive impact on global agricultural welfare (an increase of 0.1% of global projected GDP). However, our sensitivity analysis shows that for both scenarios that assume full effectiveness of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization, the beneficial influence on agricultural markets cannot compensate for climate-driven damages toward the end of the 21st century. The effectiveness of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization to translate into higher agricultural productivity at field scale is highly debated and can also reduce the nutritional value of crops (
