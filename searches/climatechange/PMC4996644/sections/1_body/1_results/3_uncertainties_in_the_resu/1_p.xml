<p class="p">Despite the existing uncertainties from climate model projections (GCMs), our results show clear negative climate change impacts on global agricultural welfare toward the end of the 21st century in the socioeconomic scenario of SRES A2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref> and table S1). Notably, the magnitude of the impacts significantly depends on the degree of international trade liberalization. We focus our analysis on the SRES A2 scenario here because patterns are easier to identify under strong changes in population, emitted GHG, and climate as represented by the SRES A2 scenario. However, our general findings are robust against the choice of the socioeconomic scenario (see the analysis of SRES B1 and A1B in addition to A2 scenario in the Supplementary Materials, fig. S6, and table S6). Results show that the patterns of impacts are preserved; that is, although producers will benefit from climate change at the global level, consumers will suffer, and the total impact on agricultural welfare will be negative. In addition, trade proves to have an even greater potential to buffer the damage. However, the overall level of damages decreases with lower population growth rates and lower emissions of GHG, and thus, limited climate change.
