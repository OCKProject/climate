<p class="p">The assumption of inelastic demand in MAgPIE could be partly responsible for the high price response under a climate shock and for the related potential upward bias in the estimated monetary impacts. We test for the sensitivity of price indices if consumers would ex post reduce their demand according to the anticipated rise in prices in our standard LIB scenario with climate change effect (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and table S7). The results indicate that this reduction in demand would only slightly offset the global price shock from climate change. The highest demand reduction and consequent decline in agricultural prices are observed in the tropical regions that are affected more strongly by climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5" class="xref">Fig. 5</xref> and table S7). In addition, the low price elasticity of food as a necessity good further decreases with development because the share of the value added from primary products declines relative to other factors in agricultural value chain (

 </xref>). Because stronger climate impacts are projected to occur mostly in the second half of the century, many of the current low-income countries will be more developed and have less elastic demand responsiveness to prices in the future (fig. S7). As indicated by many other agro-economic models, the response of demand to increasing food prices is relatively small (

 </xref>,

 </xref>); thus, the bias from inelastic demand in MAgPIE should not be a key determinant in the projected impacts.
