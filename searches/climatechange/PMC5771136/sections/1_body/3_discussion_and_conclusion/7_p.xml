The findings in this research could constitute a realistic basis for understanding the interactions and complexities between the disease (malaria), its vectors and the parasites. Including interventions in the analysis allowed to measure the level at which, continued efforts made by different governments in Africa have so far contributed to the reduction of the malaria burden. Considerable, complementary and concurrent efforts are still needed in the drive towards malaria eradication, especially in the context of climate change.
