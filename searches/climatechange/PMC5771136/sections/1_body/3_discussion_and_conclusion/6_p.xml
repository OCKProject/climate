 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>] assessed the contribution of different malaria interventions and revealed a considerable fall in malaria burden in sub-Saharan Africa beginning to the year 1980. The decline of malaria burden is partly due to a number of vector control tools [insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), indoor/aerial spraying and other], which have been developed and extensively used. Improvement in diagnosis and treatment has also contributed to the decline of the malaria burden. However, the hypothesis supporting the introduction of interventions here emphasized more on the vector control aspect, which is justified by selecting model parameters (mosquito biting rate, vector competence, adult mosquito mortality rate, and the probability that mosquito eggs survive to become adult) that directly affect malaria vectors for manipulations. Depending on the disease ecology and the policies of the government in each country, the control of malaria often uses multiple intervention measures packaged in an integrated vector management strategy. With the developed model, it was found that if the rate of interventions continues as present, a considerable reduction of malaria transmission is likely to happen by the year 2050 in Africa. However, focusing at an individual country such as Cameroon, in which the latest report is dated 2004 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] and the low number of projects and research activities directed towards reducing malaria burden as compared to other regions of Africa. On the contrary the application of intervention measures has substantially contributed to the reduction of the burden of malaria in several areas of Kenya, with up to 70% decline in malaria morbidity. An identical projection was obtained by the current study. Moreover, it is important to acknowledge that the existence of diverse malaria environments in Africa, each requiring focal intervention packages to achieve success in disease control. Herein, interventions were applied identically for each country creating a possibility of bias in the overall results.
