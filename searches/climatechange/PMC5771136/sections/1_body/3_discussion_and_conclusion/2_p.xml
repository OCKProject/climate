<p id="Par45" class="p">Mathematical models are generally an abstraction of reality. They have the ability to address the problem in form of equations that capture important linkages of complex transmission dynamics of the disease, which cannot be unraveled using laboratory and ecological experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. The basic reproduction number 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> determines the threshold values for which, disease models exhibit changes in their stabilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. The analyses presented in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>] highlighted that, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> can provide a reasonable estimate of the reduction level of malaria transmission intensity and therefore it offers a good measure to use as proxy for understanding and analyzing possible options to eliminate the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. However, the transition from malaria-free to an endemic area is generally associated to different types of bifurcations. Bifurcation arises when a slight increase/decrease in the magnitude of model parameter values triggers a sudden topological change in the disease trend. Traditional mathematical models often consider one endemic equilibrium when 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &gt; 1, which is translated to a stable disease-free equilibrium for 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &lt; 1 and unstable when 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &gt; 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. In such context, the bifurcation leading from a disease-free equilibrium to an endemic equilibrium is considered forward. Backward bifurcation occurs when the condition 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &lt; 1 cannot be used alone to explain all the required disease elimination efforts. In such case, a backward bifurcation point should be identified and the thresholds of the values of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> defined for the effective control of the disease. A backward bifurcation point co-exists with the stable disease-free equilibrium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. Such phenomenon has important public health implications because the condition of having 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> below unity will no longer be sufficient to guarantee the disease elimination; hence a new threshold for the basic reproduction number should be estimated and considered as the critical point, in which the elimination of the disease can be possible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. The hypothesis of making 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">12</sub> = 
 <italic class="italic">α m</italic>
 <sub class="sub">21</sub> helped to estimate the magnitude of the threshold (
 <italic class="italic">α</italic>) whose slight increase in the magnitude of its estimated value produces a decrease of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and hence create the possibility to obtain a globally stable endemic area of malaria. In contrast, the disease persists endemically in all cases when 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &gt; 1. In the process of using 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> to estimate the spatial representation of malaria transmission areas, an increase in the difference of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>(
 <italic class="italic">ΔR</italic>) does not necessarily indicate that the areas in the map are an endemic zone of the disease. In fact, changes of the state of malaria transmission could be noticed for values of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> less than unity.
