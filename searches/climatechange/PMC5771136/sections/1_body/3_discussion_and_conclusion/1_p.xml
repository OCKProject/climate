<p id="Par44" class="p">Climate variables play an important role in the dynamics, distribution, and transmission of vector-borne diseases such as malaria. Although rainfall is critical in providing suitable habitats for mosquitoes to breed, it explains little additional variance in malaria transmission; and therefore temperature is a key driver that affects the essential processes of mosquito biology and parasite life cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. To be more specific, temperature determines transmission intensity, including mosquito development rate, biting rate, and survival of the parasite within the mosquito [
