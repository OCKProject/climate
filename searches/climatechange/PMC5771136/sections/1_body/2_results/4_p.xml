 <sub class="sub">0</sub> considerably reduced as we move northward and southward and became almost close to zero in the temperature regions of northern and southern parts of Africa, which are currently characterized by a very low level of malaria transmission. A similar trend is observed in the highlands of eastern Africa, South Africa, western Cameroon, central Angola and the plateau of Madagascar.
