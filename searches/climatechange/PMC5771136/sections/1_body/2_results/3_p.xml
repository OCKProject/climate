<p id="Par36" class="p"> It was observed that the introduction of the coupling between the patches only has effects on the amplitude of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and not the optimal temperature for the transmission of malaria. In order words, a model with one or two patches will produce almost similar outcomes when projected spatially. Based on these results, we decided to limit the production of the spatial distribution map of the basic reproduction number 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> to a single patch model given by Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ11" ref-type="" class="xref">11</xref>). The distribution maps predicting the values of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in Africa are shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The predictions comprehensively match the known distribution map for malaria transmission and endemic zones in Africa.
