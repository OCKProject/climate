<p id="Par38" class="p">For future projection (2050), we observe a shift in areas of transmission of the disease towards the northern and southern regions of Africa (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). A projection of the developed model indicates a high risk of transmission and establishment of the disease in these regions. Malaria transmission will remain present in regions close to the equator. The future scenario also indicates that the level of malaria transmission in the Sahara Africa will highly reduce.
