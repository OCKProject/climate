<p id="Par40" class="p">The effects of interventions were computed from the subtraction of the baseline (year 2000) map to future scenario (2050) map, in which changes in the amplitude of certain models parameters as described above were made. By including intervention measures into the model, most of the regions are likely to experience a decrease in the values of
