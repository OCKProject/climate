<p id="Par43" class="p">To further confirm the performance of our approach, we overlaid the entomological 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> survey data with the magnitudes of the basic reproduction number. By considering a region with the 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> value greater than 0 as endemic, and if 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> &lt; 1, the region is moderately endemic. 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> &gt; 10 were predicted for areas with very high risk of the disease transmission. In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> the summary of the basic reproduction numbers computed for sites specific to the values of 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> are presented. The values of the basic reproduction number are large enough in all sites corresponding to high values of 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic>. Overall, the maps of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> for malaria endemicity revealed minimal bias with predicted 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> map. Nevertheless, the present map with 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> has the general tendency to overestimate prevalence by 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. The matching between predicted map of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and the estimates of 
 <italic class="italic">APfEIR</italic> map indicate consistent agreement in the 2 parameters.
