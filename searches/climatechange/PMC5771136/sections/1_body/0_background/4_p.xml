 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], it has been difficult to eradicate malaria and other vector-borne diseases. Several countries in Africa, through diverse intervention measures [usage of artemisinin-combination therapy (ACT), long lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), indoor residual spraying (IRS), mass screening and treatment (MSAT), etc.] have strengthened malaria control programs with perceptible triumph in decreasing both the disease incidence and sustained transmission. However, climate variability and changes associated to other factors are potentially redefining the conditions and areas of suitability and competence of malaria vectors and the risk of the disease as well as the sustenance of residual transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. The most direct way in which climate change is projected to effect malaria is associated with the variation of ambient temperature. This climate variable has an impact on both the mosquitoesâ€™ life-history processes and the parasites development; which both contribute to malaria transmission [
