<p id="Par7" class="p">Mathematical analysis of the threshold values of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is an important and useful tool for the understanding of disease patterns. The basic reproduction number 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> depends on the following variables: mosquito density and biting rate, vector competence and survival rate as well as parasite development time within the mosquito (i.e. extrinsic incubation time) and human recovery rate, which are related to mosquito abundance, biology or physiology, and are linked to environmental conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Mathematically, 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is employed to characterize the possibility of a disease outbreak to occur if it exceeds 1 (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &gt; 1), and the possibility of the disease to die out when 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> &lt; 1. The quantity 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> can also help in determining the initial exponential increase in the number of infection during the disease outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. In regions with endemic vector-borne diseases, it possible to determine potential control actions by varying the magnitude of the threshold value of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (usually 1). Such analysis provides appropriate guidance in the context of public health initiatives directed towards the reduction of the disease burden [
