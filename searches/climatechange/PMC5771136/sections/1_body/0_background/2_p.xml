<p id="Par6" class="p">The use of dynamic mathematical models to describe the time evolution of epidemiological systems dates back to centuries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. The time evolution of the interactions between human population and malaria vectors are modeled using several methods, which include differential equations, discrete time maps, meta-population networks and geo-spatial approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Differential equations where space is ignored and the total number of individuals in the population of vectors or hosts is constant are mostly applied. In reality, the dynamics of populations are usually effected by a variety of interactions (both inter and intra); and as a consequence, it is appropriate to consider a grouping of small local population of vectors occupying small habitat zone “network” distributed in uniform matrix [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In certain recent models of spreading epidemic, the location of the patches in space is treated explicitly by taking into account the number of connections 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic> (degree) that any given patch within the network may have [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. A common feature in the majority of such studies is the inclusion of temperature as a climatic variable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. Temperature-dependent models have been abundantly developed and the effects of temperature on population dynamics of malaria vectors have been well analyzed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. The proliferation of such modeling approach was motivated by the fact that temperature is a key element in the development of malaria vectors and parasites. A simulation model that includes the four life stages of mosquito life cycle (egg, larva, pupa, and adult) using delayed differential equations is presented in Depinay et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Through, this model, the authors showed that the ambient temperature conditions play important roles both on the mosquito life-history processes and the parasites. In the study carried out by Mordecai et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>] temperature was introduced on the basic reproduction number (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) and the results showed that the optimal temperature for malaria transmission is about 25 °C, whereas the work done by Parham and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] estimated identical variable with a magnitude of 31 °C that is 6 °C higher than predicted in Mordecai et al. [
