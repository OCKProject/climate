<p id="Par5" class="p">Malaria is one of the oldest and deadliest human vector-borne diseases. It is well known that malaria is transmitted among humans by the female Anopheles mosquito species, and the transmission cycle is essentially driven by the human-biting habit of the mosquito [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. In 2015 an estimated 212 million (range 148â€“304 million) cases of malaria occurred worldwide and 429,000 people died, mostly children in Africa [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. In 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries, an increase of nearly 5 million cases over 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. The disease is endemic and/or epidemic, depending on the climatic parameters and ecological characteristics of the geographic regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. In general, occurrence of malaria vectors is organized into various patterns under the influence of temperature and the presence of breeding sites, which facilitates their reproduction and the increase of vector populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. These parameters therefore influence the epidemiology of malaria in a particular region.
