Justifications in undertaking these studies were to reduce the disease burden through knowledge and information dissemination to empower public health workers and policymakers in better approaches to management of malaria. Still in this direction, the present study uses temperature-dependence aspect of the reproductive number obtained from dynamical mathematical network model to derive spatial distribution maps under different climatic and intervention scenarios to understand and forecast malaria transmission dynamics. The roles played by different interventions to control the disease and changes in temperature on the basic reproduction number are well analyzed.
