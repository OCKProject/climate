<p id="Par30" class="p">Many countries in Africa experience a spatial variation of temperatures and the predictions of humidity and precipitation are highly uncertain, here temperature was considered as a key factor. The selection of temperature alone is further justified by the fact that a small increase in the value of this variable leads to a significant increase in malaria vector development time and in the frequency of blood feeding in adults [

 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, the monthly 
 <italic class="italic">max</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">min</italic> temperatures are simultaneously extracted from the databases and their average estimated. The obtained information is organized into matrices with longitude as the column and latitude as the row. A point object, representing the temperature dependent mathematical expression of 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> is generated and applied in each geographical coordinate. A new matrix is formed with the values of the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> in the respective geographical coordinates. The results are converted to American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) files and transferred to an open source software Q-GIS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>] for visualization of the potential risk areas of malaria transmission under selected climate scenarios. A similar approach was used for the intervention scenarios. Overall, the method exploits the spatial variation of temperature to provide geographical predictions.
