<p id="Par32" class="p">To take into account the contribution of different interventions on the burden of malaria in Africa for our projections, we identified studies that recorded trends in the disease indicator over a period of time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. The study demonstrated that vector control has immensely contributed to the decline of the burden caused by malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. With the selected modeling framework, four parameters (mosquito biting rate 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, vector competence 
 <italic class="italic">bc</italic>, adult mosquito mortality rate 
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic>, and the probability that mosquito eggs survive to become adult

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">EA</italic>
 </sub>), which are directly linked to malaria vectors population were adjusted based on intervention effects. The application of the interventions criteria on these parameters has a direct impact on the amplitude of the basic reproduction number 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>. The following two intervention scenarios were adopted: (1) uniform application of 40% reduction in the amplitude of 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">bc</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>

  <italic class="italic">EA</italic>
 </sub> respectively; and (2) selection of two African countries and reducing the magnitude of 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">bc</italic>,
 <italic class="italic">µ</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">EA</italic>
 </sub> by up to 40% (Cameroon) and 80% (Kenya) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. The baseline for the beginning of interventions was set to year 2000. Year 2050 represents the future scenario to measure the impacts of the interventions. In the analysis, the temperature values of the years 2000 and 2050 were successively replaced by the variable
