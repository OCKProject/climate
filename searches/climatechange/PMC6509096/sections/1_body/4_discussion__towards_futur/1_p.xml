<p id="Par48" class="p">Future-Proofing Conservation aims to enable the transformation of conservation management to better accommodate uncertain, but different, climate-affected futures. We were responding to the gap noted in “
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Introduction</xref>”, that despite a substantial array of guidance, toolkits, and principles for 
 <italic class="italic">what</italic> managers should do, a lack of action and implementation remains. In this project, our partners were, from the outset, interested and willing to explore the idea that transformations in the way protected areas were governed may be necessary. We were, then, collectively confronting the “implementation gap”—the question of ‘what does climate adaptation mean in practice?’. The transitions presented earlier (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and the tools and processes developed to enable those transitions were tested in our pilot studies. In this section, we draw on the categories of incremental and transformative change to assess whether we ‘achieved’ the transitions through the Future-Proofing Conservation process, and whether the transitions did indeed accumulate to something that could be regarded as transformative. We conclude with observations around what this project suggests about transformation for climate adaptation theory.
