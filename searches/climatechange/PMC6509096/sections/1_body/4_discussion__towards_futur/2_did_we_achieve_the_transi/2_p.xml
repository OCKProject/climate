<p id="Par50" class="p">Transition #2 built the foundations for a more critical conversation. The PABAT tool was well received (see TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and readily adopted by PNN. Following our pilot applications, park managers saw immediately that it filled an important role in enabling meaningful dialogue with local communities and stakeholders around the value of the protected areas and integrated it into management planning processes. This was an incremental change, conforming with existing structures. But it also started a conversation about benefits and values being an important role that protected areas played, and so laid the foundations for later steps.
