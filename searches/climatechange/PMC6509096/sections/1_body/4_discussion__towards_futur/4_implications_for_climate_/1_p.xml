<p id="Par55" class="p">The transformation theories that informed this study emphasise the social, institutional and political aspects of decision-making (Wise et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2015</xref>), and the importance of the interaction between cognitive knowledge, social values and institutional rules (Gorddard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2016</xref>). On the basis of working directly with partners to address the gap between recognition of the need for change and the implementation of transformation in practice, we found that exploring the social, institutional and political space created options for transforming management that were otherwise not apparent. The study suggests that the cognitive shift of recognising the need for changed management is not difficult; practitioners were already well aware that biophysical change was underway and needed new management strategies. However, the ‘gap’ arose when they sought to apply this cognitive shift directly to policy, planning and management shifts,
