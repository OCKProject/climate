<p id="Par12" class="p">Conservation managers in the twenty-first century are confronting relentlessly increasing pressure to cope with change. The magnitude and nature of potential future ecological transformation challenges the very foundations of conservation (Stein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wyborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2016</xref>). The most commonly accepted norm for dealing with this pressure is to seek out scientific and technical advice for decision-making, including species adaptiveness (Beever et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2016</xref>), ecological modelling (Hannah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2017</xref>), vulnerability (Metcalf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>) and projected changes (Foden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2013</xref>). As West et al. wrote, the idea of “managing for change” in conservation “…will be a challenging proposition since it is difficult to anticipate threshold changes and because the array of potential states into which a system may change is highly uncertain; thus concentrated research to understand the characteristics and indicators of threshold responses will be essential” (West et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95" class="xref">2009</xref>, p. 1018). Yet despite the prevalence of this norm, there is growing awareness that there may be limits to technical solutions, as climate adaptation is recognised as a complex socio-political process involving authority, knowledge and subjective values (Hagerman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">2010</xref>; Lemieux and Scott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2011</xref>; Eriksen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2015</xref>). Over the last decade, a growing array of scholars are drawing attention to the institutional dimensions of climate adaptation in conservation. Rannow et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014</xref>) highlight technical and legal issues for protected areas, while Abrahms et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2017</xref>) make recommendations on technical knowledge, tools and frameworks for managing protected areas under climate change. Yet despite established frameworks and principles (Gross et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2016</xref>), analysts note that “Implementation of adaptation plans and strategies continues to lag…” (Stein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2013</xref>, p. 2, see also Jantarasami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2010</xref>; Wise et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2014</xref>). In general terms, this can be regarded as the fault line that emerges when new (climate adaptation) demands are imposed on organisational structures that have been created and evolved to meet the old (maintain existing ecosystems) demands. As Stein et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2013</xref>) go on to observe “…while the concept of adaptive capacity is often thought of in reference to the species and ecosystems that are the targets of adaptation action, the ability of institutions themselves to adjust and evolve will be key to their ability to change” (p. 508). (See also Dunlop et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wyborn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2016</xref>.) But although there is growing documentation of 
 <italic class="italic">what</italic> conservation institutions should do to govern for climate adaptation, relatively few have asked 
 <italic class="italic">how</italic> they can adjust or, as Pelling (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2011</xref>) argues, transform in the face of climate change 
 <italic class="italic">from their existing governance structures</italic>?
