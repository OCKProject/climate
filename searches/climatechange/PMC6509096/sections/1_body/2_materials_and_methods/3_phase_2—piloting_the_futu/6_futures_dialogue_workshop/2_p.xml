<p id="Par41" class="p">The first sessions aim to build shared understanding that 
 <italic class="italic">ecological change is inevitable</italic> and recognise the difference between ecological change as a biophysical phenomenon and its effects on benefits for society. Questions A-B draw linkages between ecological features and benefits. Facilitators start with values participants expressed through the previous PA-BAT workshop as benefits from protected areas, and consider whether the ecological or landscape features that support that benefit are known to be vulnerable to change.
