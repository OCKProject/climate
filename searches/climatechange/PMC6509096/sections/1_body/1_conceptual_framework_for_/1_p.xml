<p id="Par14" class="p">The Future-Proofing Conservation project was founded on a philosophical perspective drawn from evolutionary learning. Ansell and colleagues (Ansell and Gash

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2011</xref>) propose that evolutionary learning takes place through three central and interconnected activities. First, taking a problem-driven perspective, ensuring that abstract concepts (in our case, around futures thinking, transformation, governance and values) are grounded in actual problems and the experience of participants, and a thorough understanding of decision-making contexts. Our collaboration directly involved practitioner partners to develop shared understanding of climate adaptation as a management problem and its socio-political framing. Second, it recognises that being reflexive about individual and institutional frameworks which shape possible actions can create new options for change. We considered both the formal institutional arrangements and the historically embedded informal expectations and norms that influence conservation actions (Ostrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">1999</xref>). Third, it involves creating spaces where stakeholders can develop ideas, discuss social values, share information, and consider current institutional rules and future possibilities for change. We co-designed processes that encourage partners and participants to work together to explore implications of new information and create new understandings and solutions.
