<p id="Par13" class="p">The negative effect of climate change will be remarkable for 
 <italic class="italic">C. austiniae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. schenckii</italic>. The extinction of 
 <italic class="italic">C. austiniae</italic> was predicted in all analyses. The coverage of suitable niche of 
 <italic class="italic">P. schenckii</italic> will decrease to 1-30% of its current extent. The reduction of at least 50% of climatic niche coverage of 
 <italic class="italic">E. cassythoides</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">L. abortivum</italic> will be observed. On the other hand, the coverage of suitable niches of 
 <italic class="italic">H. spicata, U. ulaei</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">W. calcarata</italic> may be even 16â€“74 times larger than in the present time.
