<p id="Par6" class="p">The calculated AUC values were high for all created models (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Most of them are consistent with the actually known geographical range of the studied species (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). Discrepancies are observed in model of

 <italic class="italic">A. montana</italic>,
