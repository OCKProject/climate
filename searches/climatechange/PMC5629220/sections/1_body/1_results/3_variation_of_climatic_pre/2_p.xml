Isothermality (bio3 = −1.197), the precipitation of the coldest quarter (bio19 = 0.704), as well as, the annual mean temperature (bio1 = 3.137), the mean diurnal range of the temperature (bio2 = 1.971) and the maximum temperature of the warmest month (bio5 = −2.983) had also the significant meaning in the performed discrimination of the studied orchids. The bioclimatic differences between the pairs of species were evaluated by permutation tests of the climatic factors. The interaction term in the MANOVA (Pillai’s trace = 3.843; F
