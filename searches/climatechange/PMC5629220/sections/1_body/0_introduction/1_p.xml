 </sup>. The recent studies confirmed that plant distribution is determined by climatic factors and while the temperature-related stress controls the upper-latitudinal and upper-altitudinal range limits of a large proportion of many plant species, other variables (e.g. water deficiency stress) may be important at the lower range limits

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that increase in global mean temperature of 1–3 °C above 1990 levels will give a beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Global climate change has already had observable negative effects on the nature, e.g. shrunk of the glaciers, more frequent fires, longer periods of water deficiency in some regions and an increase in the number, duration and intensity of tropical storms. However, also positive impact on environment are expected be witnessed. Higher CO
