<p id="Par26" class="p">To estimate the impact of hypothetical climate changes on the coverage of suitable niches of studied plants we used the same climatic variables as considered in the present models. The layers based on the coupled global climate models were used (

Three various emission scenarios for 2080 were analysed: A1b (CCCMA-CGCM3 SRES simulation), A2a (CCCMA-CGCM2 SRES) and B2a (CCCMA-CGCM2 SRES). This approach was used in numerous recent studies that focused on the climate change impact on the distribution of various organisms
