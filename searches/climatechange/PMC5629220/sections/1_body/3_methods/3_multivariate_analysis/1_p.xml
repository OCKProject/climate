<p id="Par27" class="p">Principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to explain the general variation pattern among the studied holomycotrophic species, based on 12 bioclimatic factors used in ENM analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>) and altitudinal data. To determine the bioclimatic factors which differentiate the studied orchids the most, the canonical variate analysis (CVA) was applied, in order to reduce the data set by selecting only the factors that showed strongest discrimination. The significance of bioclimatic differences between the studied species was evaluated using Wilk’s λ and Goodall’s F-ratio with 1000 permutations. In turn, the Mahalanobis distance matrix was prepared to classification of examined species and was used in the cluster analysis UPGMA (unweighted pair-group average method)
