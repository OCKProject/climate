<p id="Par17" class="p">It is not clear how and whether the function of mycorrhizal fungi in orchid germination and growth will be maintained with rising temperature, erratic rainfall and reduced moisture. The research conducted on photosynthetic, terrestrial orchids from Europe -

 </sup>. Furthermore, the modifications of the soil structure which is especially important for terrestrial plants are extremely difficult to evaluate due to multiple factors which can influence the ground properties. Studies on European plants growing in understory layer indicated that numerous species are able to shift their realized niches, also for soil nutrients and pH

Direct effects include changes in resource availability and change in distribution of mycorrhizas. Indirect effects include changes in below ground allocation of C to roots and changes in plant species distribution
