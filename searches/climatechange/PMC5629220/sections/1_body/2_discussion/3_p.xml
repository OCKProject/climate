<p id="Par16" class="p">Obviously, the actual future range of studied orchids may be slightly different than presented in our models. The availability of mycorrhizal fungi and presence of pollinators may restrict the distribution of these species while the niche shift may allow them to occupy new habitats. The current state of knowledge on the specify of holomycotrophic orchid symbionts and their dependence on particular pollen carriers is unfortunately too incomplete to include these elements in the analyses. Moreover, such complex ecological process are not possible to evaluate using currently available statistic approaches. However, we do believe that climate is the key factor limiting occurrence of most organisms by determining characteristics and distributions of natural and managed systems. Hereby modeling of distribution of climatic niches is the first step to evaluate the response of particular species to the possible climate changes.</p>
