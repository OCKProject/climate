<p id="Par18" class="p">As mentioned before the pollinators availability can limit the long term viability of orchid populations, but this factor could not be included in our analyses due to the lack of sufficient data on pollinator specificity of studied plants. We know at least five species of insects that can pollinate

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>, but the complete set of species which are able to transfer pollinia of this orchid remains unknown, in turn, the recent study proved that the turnover in the composition of insect communities may occur in the future

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. On the other hand, almost no data on pollinators of tropical Orchidaceae has been published. The estimation of the impact of future climate changes on the pollinators distribution in not the only problem because, as indicated by Robbirt

 <sup class="sup">

 </sup> climate changes can also led to asynchrony in flowering of orchids and insect flight periods. The future modification in insects phenology are related with early adult emergence
