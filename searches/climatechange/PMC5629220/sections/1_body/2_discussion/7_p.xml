 </sup>. Out of the 16 studied species, the potential suitable niches was not negatively affected in all the models. In our opinion the most significant threat for the plants is the direct human activity that results in habitat destruction and fragmentation or modification of the ecosystem net. The other conclusion of our study is that generalization of the effect of global warming is misleading. Not all organisms, even related, occurring in the same geographical region and preferring similar climatic conditions will face the same modifications of their suitable niches. The object of our study were holomycotrophic orchids that in theory should respond in a similar way for a global warming. The conducted niche modeling and analysis of the similarity of their climatic tolerance showed instead that the future modification of the coverage of their suitable niches will not be unified.
