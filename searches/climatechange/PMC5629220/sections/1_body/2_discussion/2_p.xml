<p id="Par15" class="p">In our study three different scenarios of future climate changes were tested to obtain the most comprehensive insight in the possible climatic niche loss of 16 species of holomycotrophic orchids. No general trend in the response of holomycotrophic orchid for climate changes was identified. We did not recognize any correlation between climatic factors currently limiting the distribution of the studied orchids with their response to climate changes. The first of two clades recognized in the UPGMA dendrogram included 12 species from different geographical regions (Europe, Asia, Australia, South and North America) which suitable niche coverage will be variously modified in the future. The second clade included species which potential niche coverage will increase as a result of climate change - two South American species (
