<p id="Par19" class="p">Orchids as a group show evolutionary flexibility whereby diversification in the family is often related to habitat complexity and fragmentation. Throughout their history, Orchidaceae have been able to cope with face of climatic change caused by shifting continents, mountain uplifting, fluctuating sea levels and temperatures
