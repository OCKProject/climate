 </sup>, as explained in the next subsection. The following variables are used for the initial and boundary conditions: atmospheric temperature, geopotential height, pressure, specific humidity, zonal and meridional winds, surface pressure, skin temperature, sea surface temperature (SST), soil temperature and soil moisture. Note that the SST was given as a temporally averaged value in each integration period and then kept constant throughout a five-day simulation. The initial and boundary conditions for the Present-DDS and Future-DDS experiments are directly given from GCM outputs, whereas these conditions for the other two experiments are prepared according to the following procedure using GCM outputs. First, the climatology and perturbation were calculated for the present and future climate. The climatology of the large-scale atmospheric state was determined via two steps: (1) monthly means averaged over 25 years were prepared from May to October; (2) regarding these as the 15th day of each month, the climatology on each day was determined by their linear interpolation. Thus, the climatology varied from day to day. The perturbation was calculated by subtracting the obtained daily climatology from the 6-hourly data. Then, the initial and boundary conditions of the RCM were prepared by combining these climatology and perturbation according to the experimental design listed in TableÂ

The specific humidity is calculated from the temperature constructed by the procedure described above and the relative humidity. The relative humidity used for Pseudo-Clim-DS and Pseudo-Perturb-DS is assumed to depend on the climate of perturbation, namely, the relative humidity for these experiments were obtained from the present and future GCM simulations, respectively. The assumption that the relative humidity remains unchanged between present and future climates is common in the pseudo-warming method
