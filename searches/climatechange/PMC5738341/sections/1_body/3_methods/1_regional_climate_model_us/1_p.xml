 </sup> version 4.2.5. The calculation domains cover an area of 2520 × 2520 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> with a grid spacing of 7.5 km for the outer domain and an area of 1080 × 960 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> with a grid spacing of 2.5 km for the inner domain. In the vertical direction, the outer and inner domains have 36 and 60 layers, respectively. The calculation period for the downscaling experiments was from 31 May to 30 September during 1979–2003 for the present climate experiment and during 2075–2099 for the future climate experiment. This 4-month calculation in each year was divided into 31 runs, and each run was conducted every four days. The integration period of one run was five days, which consisted of one day for model spin-up and four days for analysis. The outputs from the last 4 days were connected sequentially and used for the analysis. Thus, the period from 1 June to 30 September of each year was analysed.
