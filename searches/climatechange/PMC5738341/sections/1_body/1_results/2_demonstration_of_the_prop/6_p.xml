<p id="Par24" class="p">On the other hand, the mean and extreme precipitations were decreased by the changes in perturbation. This decrease exceeded or was comparable to the increase due to the changes in climatology, as shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a, b</xref>. The perturbation change is particularly characterised by the changes in the frequency and intensity of the disturbances causing precipitation. According to a cyclone analysis based on the detection method of Adachi and Kimura

 </sup>, the decrease in precipitation associated with typhoons and extratropical cyclones accounted for more than 95% of the precipitation decrease due to the perturbation change between Present-DDS and Pseudo-Perturb-DS, whereas changes in the precipitation due to weather events other than cyclones were quite small. Further analysis showed that the numbers of typhoons and extratropical cyclones affecting the studied region were projected to decrease by 40 and 15%, respectively, whereas the precipitation brought on by a single event, i.e. one typhoon or one extratropical cyclone, to the region remained almost unchanged between the two experiments. Thus, the precipitation decrease due to perturbation changes can be explained by the decreases in the numbers of typhoon and extratropical cyclone events in this case.
