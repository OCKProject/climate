<p id="Par26" class="p">From the viewpoint of reducing disaster risk, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref> shows the relationship between the precipitation intensity and changes in wet days. The total change in wet days between the present and future climates is small across all categories. However, the small total change is a result of the counteracting contributions of the three studied factors. The changes in the perturbation decrease the wet days for all categories, while the changes in the climatology drastically increase the wet days in heavier precipitation. On the other hand, the nonlinear effect drastically decreases the wet days for extreme precipitation of more than 300 mm  per day. That is, the nonlinear effect suppresses the precipitation increase due to the climatology change, especially for extreme precipitation. The increase in the frequency of extreme precipitation results from an increase due to the changes in the climatology outweighing the sum of the decrease due to the perturbation changes and counteraction from the nonlinear effect.
