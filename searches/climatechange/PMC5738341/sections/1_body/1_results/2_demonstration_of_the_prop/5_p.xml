<p id="Par23" class="p">The changes in climatology increased both the mean and extreme precipitations. The increasing rate of the extreme precipitation (R1D) was larger than that of the mean precipitation (RAVE); this result is consistent with those of previous studies

 </sup>. Regardless of the mean and extreme precipitation, increases due to the climatology change can be explained by the thermodynamic changes in the large-scale atmosphere, i.e. the precipitation increases due to the enriched water vapour in the warm atmosphere related to the Clausiusâ€“Clapeyron relationship.
