<p id="Par22" class="p">To investigate whether the results of the mean precipitation would hold true for extreme precipitation, other precipitation indices, R1D and CDD, were also evaluated. Although R1D shows little change between the present and future climates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>), this result does not mean that the changes in each large-scale atmospheric component have no effect. The decrease in R1D due to the perturbation change is comparable to the increase due to the climatology change; the small change in R1D between the present and future climates is simply a consequence of cancelling the contributions from the two component changes. The nonlinear effect suppresses the expected climate change for R1D, because the expected climate change slightly increases and (Δ

 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Because (Δ

 <italic class="italic">cp</italic> &gt; 0, the nonlinear effect enhances the expected climate change in CDD. Thus, the magnitude and direction of the contributions of the climatology and perturbation depend on the target index. The role of the nonlinear effect also depends on the index. Its magnitude is relatively small but not negligible for the total change.
