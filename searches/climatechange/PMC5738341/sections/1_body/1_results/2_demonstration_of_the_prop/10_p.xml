<p id="Par28" class="p">We had presumed that the precipitation amount would be affected by climatology changes, whereas the intensity might rather be influenced by perturbation changes. However, the demonstrated results were different from our expectation. The cumulative precipitation was largely influenced by the changes in the perturbation, whereas the precipitation intensity was mainly affected by the changes in the climatology, at least in the demonstrated case.</p>
