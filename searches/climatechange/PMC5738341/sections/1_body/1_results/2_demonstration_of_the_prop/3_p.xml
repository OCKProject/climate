<p id="Par21" class="p">RAVE in the Present-DDS, Future-DDS and their difference are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>–c, respectively. RAVE in the future climate decreases from that in the present climate for most areas. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d, e</xref> show the changes in RAVE due to the changes in the climatology and perturbation, respectively. Changing the climatology slightly increases RAVE, especially for the northern area, while changing the perturbation accounts for a large part of the total decrease in RAVE. The areal mean of the RAVE change is summarised in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>. The rate of increase in mean precipitation due to the changes in climatology is approximately 3% under the 3.6 °C warming of the surface temperature from the present climate; this value is consistent with those in previous studies

 </sup>. On the other hand, the rate of decrease due to the changes in perturbation is ~14%; the reason for the large decrease is explained later. The change in RAVE for the expected climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2f</xref>) has a similar distribution to that of the total mean precipitation change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) in most areas. This means that the mean precipitation change can largely be explained by summing the influences of the climatology and perturbation changes. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g</xref> shows the nonlinear effect Δ
 <italic class="italic">cp</italic> between the changes in the two components. Although the magnitude of the nonlinear effect is small over most areas, it is comparable to the influence of the changes in the climatology. The relationship between the expected climate change and Δ
 <italic class="italic">cp</italic> varies with the location. In terms of the areal mean, the nonlinear effect tends to enhance the expected climate change for RAVE because (Δ
