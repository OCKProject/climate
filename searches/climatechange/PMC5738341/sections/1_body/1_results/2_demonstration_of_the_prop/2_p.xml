<p id="Par20" class="p">To simplify the subsequent discussion, we consider that the major factors affecting the precipitation change due to climatology and perturbation changes are roughly understood to be the thermodynamic and dynamic changes, respectively. This would be reasonable in at least the mid latitudes and high latitudes; for the climatology change, a previous study

 </sup> already showed that the influence of thermodynamic change is larger than that of dynamic change, while for the perturbation change, the indirect thermodynamic influence due to slight changes in the disturbance track may be relatively low compared with the direct dynamic influence due to changes in the frequency, intensity and track of the disturbance in a limited area.
