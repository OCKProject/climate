<p id="Par27" class="p">From the viewpoint of securing water resources, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> shows the amount of cumulative precipitation against the precipitation intensity. Most of the precipitation amount results from weak precipitation of less than 100 mm  per day. The cumulative precipitations in Future-DDS and Pseudo-Perturb-DS are only ~90% of that in Present-DDS because the frequency of weak precipitation of less than 100 mm  per day decreases in Future-DDS and Pseudo-Perturb-DS compared to in Present-DDS, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a</xref>. This means that the changes in the perturbation affect the frequency of weak precipitation, which changes the amount of precipitation.
