<p id="Par10" class="p">We propose a new procedure for evaluating these contributions to regional climate change. The proposed procedure requires an experimental set consisting of four experiments: two direct dynamical downscaling (DDS) experiments for the present and future climates and two experiments with boundary conditions exchanging either climatology or perturbation components between the two climates. The DDS experiments are conventional downscaling simulations, for which boundary conditions are given directly from GCM outputs. An analysis with four experiments allows not only for the influence of each component to be estimated but also for the influence due to the nonlinear effect between the two components to be extracted. Thus, by using this procedure, we can divide the causes of regional climate change into three factors: climatology change, perturbation change and the nonlinear effect between them. The demonstration of this procedure shows the importance of the symmetric treatment of the changes in climatology and perturbation to precisely understand the regional climate change. At the same time, the nonlinear effect also shows some significant influence, especially for extreme rainfall events.</p>
