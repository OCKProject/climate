<p id="Par4" class="p">Changes in the amount, frequency and intensity of regional precipitation are affected by thermodynamic and dynamic changes in the large-scale atmospheric conditions. Increasing greenhouse gases are known to raise the air temperature by modifying the atmospheric radiative balance
