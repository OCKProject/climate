 </sup>. In these studies, a large-scale atmospheric state is decomposed into mean states and fluctuations from it, and the influences of the decomposed components on the regional climate were subsequently evaluated by constraining a boundary condition of the RCM. In this paper, the mean and fluctuation components of the large-scale atmosphere are called climatology and perturbation, respectively.
