 </sup> attempted to evaluate the influences of thermodynamic and dynamic changes in the atmosphere on global precipitation by using results from multiple general circulation models (GCMs). They reported that thermodynamic change, rather than dynamic change, plays a dominant role for both the mean and extreme precipitation in most areas, especially in the mid latitudes and high latitudes.
