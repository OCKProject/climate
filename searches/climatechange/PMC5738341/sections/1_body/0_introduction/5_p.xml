<p id="Par7" class="p">The evaluation separating the influences of the climatology and perturbation changes can be interpreted from the viewpoint of the thermodynamic and dynamic changes in the large-scale state as follows. Here, we assume that one component is changed, while the other remains unchanged. The changes in climatology between two climates include both the thermodynamic and dynamic changes. The thermodynamic change due to the climatology change corresponds to the increase in the atmospheric moisture content associated with temperature warming, while the dynamic change corresponds to changes in the large-scale flow pattern caused by global circulation such as Hadley circulation and the position and strength of the westerly jets. The perturbation change also includes both the thermodynamic and dynamic changes. The dynamic change due to the perturbation change refers to changes in the frequency, intensity and track of disturbances such as tropical and extratropical cyclones, while the thermodynamic change refers to the changes in the temperature and humidity of the disturbances, accompanied by their changes in track.</p>
