 </sup>. This method uses a boundary condition that modifies only the climatology. Although the changes in both the precipitation amount and intensity have been explained mainly by the changes in climatology thus far, there is a possibility that changes in the perturbation also significantly influence the precipitation, especially its intensity, in a limited region. This is because the changes in the track and frequency of cyclones directly affect the region through which they pass. Because the changes in perturbation are not considered in the pseudo-warming method, the degree of influence of the perturbation change on the regional climate projection has become a concern when using this method
