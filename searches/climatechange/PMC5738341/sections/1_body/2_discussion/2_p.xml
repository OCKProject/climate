<p id="Par30" class="p">If the changes in perturbation are considered along with those in climatology, the regional precipitation change can be determined by the balance of the thermodynamic effect in the mean state, the changes in the mean atmospheric structure, and changes in perturbation. Among these, the influence of the perturbation changes is strongly dependent on the location and size of an evaluated area; the smaller the size of the evaluated area is, the larger the influence due to the perturbation change becomes. The changes in perturbation are potentially crucial for the future regional climate.</p>
