<p id="Par31" class="p">The demonstrated results show a view regarding a debatable point whether the use of the pseudo-warming method is valid for projecting the future regional climate. The pseudo-warming method has the advantage of reducing the model bias in a GCM projection by using the reanalysis data for the present climate. However, the future downscaling projection is performed using the present perturbation

 </sup>. There have been concerns that the pseudo-warming method may underestimate or overestimate extremes for the projected climate, because the activities of atmospheric disturbances, such as tropical and extratropical cyclones, are projected to change due to global warming in some models

 </sup>. In our demonstration of the proposed procedure, perturbation changes have a large impact on the precipitation change. This means that the effect of the changes in perturbation cannot be negligible for the projection in areas where the frequency and intensity of large-scale disturbances are projected to change in the future climate. The demonstration further indicates that the nonlinear effect inhibits the intensification of precipitation due to climatology changes. This result implies the possibility that the pseudo-warming method overestimates the extreme precipitation events, at least in the area and season evaluated. Further evaluation of the physical meaning of the nonlinear effect is necessary for a greater understanding of the essence of the pseudo-warming method.
