<p id="Par33" class="p">In this study, only a pair of present and future climates estimated by a single GCM was used. However, there is uncertainty in future climate projections with GCMs because of imperfections regarding the emission scenario and model, amongst others. The uncertainties would be involved in both the climatology and perturbation of the future projections. By applying our procedure to multi-regional climate projections using multi-GCM projections, the procedure may also provide information on the characteristics of uncertainty in regional climate projections, such as which atmospheric component causes a spread in regional climate projections.</p>
