<p id="Par32" class="p">Although many studies have concentrated on projecting the future climate and evaluating the effect of climatology changes so far, the results of our procedure emphasise the importance of the symmetric treatment of changes in climatology and perturbation along with the nonlinear effect to precisely understand the regional climate projection. By considering the influence of each change and their nonlinear effects, the procedure could provide clues to the mechanisms that cause future regional climate change. To understand the mechanisms in more detail, it would be helpful to separate the factors affecting the regional climate and evaluate their contributions quantitatively; for example, thermodynamic and dynamic changes in climatology, those in perturbation and ground surface conditions such as land use.</p>
