<p id="Par29" class="p">Most of changes in the precipitation due to climatology changes can be explained by the thermodynamic change in the large-scale atmosphere associated with the Clausius–Clapeyron effect. On the other hand, the changes in climatology also include changes in the dynamic structure of the atmosphere, such as the atmospheric stability, as described above. Because the temperature increase due to global warming is greater in the upper troposphere, the vertical stability increases

 </sup>. The climatology projected in MRI-AGCM3.2S also indicates such stabilisation, and the downscaled results in Pseudo-Clim-DS and Future-DDS reflect this tendency. Regarding the influence of changes in climatology on the precipitation intensity, the results from Pseudo-Clim-DS indicate that heavy precipitation was enhanced and weak precipitation was slightly suppressed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The reduction of weak precipitation seems to be attributable to the stabilisation of the atmosphere in the future climate. To more quantitatively evaluate these two effects, further experiments using appropriate boundary conditions are required. As an example, Kröner et al.
