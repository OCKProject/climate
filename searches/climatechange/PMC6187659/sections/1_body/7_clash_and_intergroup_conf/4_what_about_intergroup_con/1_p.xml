<p class="p">During the past 10 thousand years, climate has been subject to some variation but has often quickly restored balance. The most plausible reason for this stability is the fact that Earth’s orbit around the Sun has not been subject to any important change (
 <xref rid="bibr63-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ricard, 2015</xref>). Until recently, that is. There is consensus among climate experts that since 1950 global warming has been largely due to human activity—such as use of motor vehicles, fertilizer consumption, and livestock and waste emissions. This stability of climate before 1950 gives conceptual status to climate as cause of culture. It is unlikely that culture shapes climate, and it is also unlikely that variables closely linked to culture (e.g., wealth, income inequality, political circumstances, governance) shape climate. It is much more likely that climate shapes these variables.
