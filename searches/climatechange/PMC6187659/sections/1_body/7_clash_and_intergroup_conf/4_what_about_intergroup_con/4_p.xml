Reminding people of the adverse effects of climate change tends to bring about a stronger belief in authority—greater endorsement of leaders who punish norm violators. But more importantly, such reminders also tend to increase out-group derogation (

As the researchers themselves note, it is possible that people pursue a stronger psychological sense of connection with their in-group in the face of adversity caused by climate change. As we noted for climate as such, it very likely that people, both as individuals and collectives, adapt to climate change. In-group favouritism, which tends to be stronger in warmer countries with less seasonal variation in temperature (

It is the coping with unpredictability that is important—this may bring people together, perhaps especially members of in-groups. But still, adapting to predictable change is a key aspect that may reinforce a culture of planning, involving focus on time and self-control, which is both an individual and collective way of adapting to climate and climate-related circumstances.
