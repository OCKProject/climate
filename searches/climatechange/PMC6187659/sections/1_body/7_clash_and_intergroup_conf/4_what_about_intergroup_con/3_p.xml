<p class="p">It is interesting to discuss the broader implications of global warming. It is likely to increase the poverty around the equator. People have already discussed poverty around the so-called equatorial Grand Canyon, a hot belt several thousand kilometers around the equator, characterized by an exceptionally large concentration of lower income countries (e.g.,

Clearly, scarcity of resources can be a powerful source of intergroup conflict. Further, we witness an increase in migration, which in part may be triggered by climate change. This too may enhance intergroup hostility, because newcomers to a country tend to pose a threatâ€”a threat to the availability of jobs, a threat of diseases, and perhaps a threat to existing culture. Clearly, these issues are central to the extended model of CLASH where wealth, income inequality, and parasite stress are assumed to be important variables.
