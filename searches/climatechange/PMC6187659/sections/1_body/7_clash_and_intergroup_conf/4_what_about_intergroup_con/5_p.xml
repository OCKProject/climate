<p class="p">More generally, if CLASH is correct, aggression and violence may move away a little bit further from the equator—to regions that are more heavily populated. One might speculate that in the future, France would become in-group oriented at a level we may see now in Southern Italy. Perhaps Northern California and Oregon will become very similar to a subculture we may witness now in Southern California. But we predict in particular that people will seek to move away from the unbearable heat. Technological solutions, such as air conditioning, have been shown to be effective. But it is the broader climate-related environment which guides variables such as wealth versus poverty (e.g., support for agriculture) and ecological circumstances (e.g., disease threat) that may help explain increases in intergroup conflict (and migration). And perhaps there is a truly independent effect of temperature and seasonal variation in temperature that will help us understand differences in culture, especially differences in a culture of planning—with a strong focus on time, self-control, or less so. Clearly, these are rather speculative thoughts, but CLASH is one of the few models in the behavioural sciences that sets climate on the agenda of human behaviour and culture.</p>
