 <xref rid="bibr7-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bernhard, Fischbacher, &amp; Fehr, 2006</xref>), there is strong reason to believe that in situations that may give rise to conflict, members of out-groups especially may threaten harmony and cooperation between out-group members (see also 
 <xref rid="bibr56-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Parks, Joireman, &amp; van Lange, 2013</xref>). Therefore, one way to restrain or overcome a hostile mindset for out-group members is to adopt a longer time orientation and exert self-control in interactions with out-group members, especially in situations in which out-group members may violate norms or may not be trusted. In other words, one way to restrain or overcome a hostile mindset is for individuals to adopt a future orientation and exert self-control in interactions with out-group members. Needless to say, this seems especially important when feelings of injustice are activated, or when out-group anger is activated (e.g., when out-group members show little respect for oneâ€™s own group).
