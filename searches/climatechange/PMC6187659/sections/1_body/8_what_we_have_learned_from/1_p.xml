<p class="p">CLASH is a new theory and has generated considerable debate (see 
 <xref rid="bibr84-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Lange et al., 2017c</xref>). One reason for the debate is that CLASH is young and strongly in need of empirical research. Another reason is that a climatological approach is novel, and many scholars seem to assume that aggression and violence are due to factors other than climate (e.g., governance, economics, scarcity of resources, historic variables such as colonization). We find this debate healthy, and we do not think these alternative theories conflict with CLASH. Indeed, climate may well be the ultimate reason for how individuals and groups cope with circumstances that are strongly shaped by climate. Next, we discuss some of the important lessons learned from the scientific debate about CLASH.
