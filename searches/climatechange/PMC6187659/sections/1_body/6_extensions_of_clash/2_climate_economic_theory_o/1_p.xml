<p class="p">It is also plausible that climate in combination with wealth (or specifically monetary resources) determine future orientation and self-control, as assumed in the climate-economic theory of freedom (

 <xref rid="bibr75-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). One especially relevant prediction of this theory is that monetary resources matter more in demanding climates. The rich can cope well because of their resources, and even come to view demanding climates as a welcome challenge, whereas the poor view demanding climates as a genuine threat to their survival and well-being. There is good evidence for this theory in other social domains. For example, a longitudinal study involving 123 countries found that generalized trust in strangers is determined by climate, primarily among the wealthier countries (

Another study involving 74 countries found that adults in increasingly demanding cold or hot climates value cooperative enculturation of children if their society is richer, but value egoistic enculturation if their society is poorer (

 <italic class="italic">and</italic> wealth for issues that are linked to self-control and aggression. Thus, the climate-economic theory of freedom predicts that aggression and violence levels should be higher in countries with higher temperatures (and less seasonal variation) and low levels of national wealth. CLASH can provide a critical test of this prediction, and inform us whether this pattern would be mediated by future orientation and self-control.
