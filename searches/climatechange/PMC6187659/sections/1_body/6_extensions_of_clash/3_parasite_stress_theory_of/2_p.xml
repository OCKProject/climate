<p class="p">Interestingly, parasite stress has also been shown to be linked to the classic cultural dimension of individualism versus collectivism (
 <xref rid="bibr39-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hofstede, 2001</xref>). In contemporary societies, individualism and collectivism are strongly linked to crossing in-group and out-group boundaries. Collectivists emphasize these boundaries, and tend to distrust and avoid out-group members. In contrast, individualists are more likely to cross these boundaries, and tend to trust out-group members (e.g.,

In countries with milder climates and more seasonal variation, the relative absence of parasite stress goes hand in hand with the development of individualism. As such, collectivism, which is more prevalent in warmer locations with less seasonal variation, brings about an intergroup tension that is far less intense than in individualistic countries. The present research can provide a critical test of this prediction by examining whether parasite stress is associated with aggression toward out-group members, and whether it completely or partially mediates the influences of climate predicted by CLASH. In addition, some studies are conducted within countries, where parasite stress is relatively weak and where it is does not covary with climate. Within-country studies can provide a critical test of CLASH while controlling for parasite stress.
