<p class="p">We proposed a new model of aggression and violence, called CLimate, Aggression, and Self-control in Humans (CLASH; 
 <xref rid="bibr83-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Lange et al., 2017b</xref>), to understand differences in aggression and violence within and between countries in terms of differences in climate (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2-1368430217735579" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). To explicate the logic and to facilitate empirical tests, we have advanced two broad propositions of CLASH (for an extensive discussion, partly summarized here, see 
 <xref rid="bibr83-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Lange et al., 2017b</xref>). The first proposition is that lower temperatures and especially greater seasonal variation in temperature influence individuals and societies to adopt a greater future orientation and enhanced self-control (Proposition 1). The second proposition is that self-control and future time orientation are important inhibitors of aggression and violence (Proposition 2).
