There is not much cross-national research on self-control, but there is some tentative evidence to suggest that there may be a link between self-control and climate. One example is a recent study that found higher levels of self-reported self-control in Northern European countries (e.g., Scandinavian countries, Iceland) than in Southern European countries or the United States (
