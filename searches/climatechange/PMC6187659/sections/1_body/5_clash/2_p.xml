<p class="p">CLASH builds on life history theory, an evolutionary theory that suggests the importance of environmental “harshness” and “unpredictability” for the development of

In contrast, two underlying aspects of a slow life strategy are high future focus and high self-control. Planning for the future and resisting temptation are intrinsic parts of a slow life strategy (

Stripped to its essentials, life history theory argues that under harsh and unpredictable environmental conditions, people tend to adopt a fast life strategy because future rewards are less likely to occur. Conversely, under less harsh and more predictable conditions, people tend to adopt a slow life strategy because future rewards are more likely to occur (
