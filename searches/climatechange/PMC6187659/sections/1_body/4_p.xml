<p class="p">We offer an alternative, 
 <italic class="italic">climatological</italic> model. It is based on the assumption that people living in different parts of the world, and even different parts of the same country, adapt to different climatological circumstances. Moreover, our perspective assumes that people, as individuals and groups, create and maintain cultures (e.g., norms, institutes, and markets) that adapt to relatively 
 <italic class="italic">stable</italic> climatological circumstances. Although climate includes many aspects, we focus on temperature as the primary feature of climate.
