<p class="p">Needless to say, intergroup conflict is one of the most classic topics in social psychology. A theoretical analysis such as CLASH and its extensions, which focus on climate and culture, is relatively new. Indeed, more classic approaches are realistic group conflict (

None of these theories include climate in their analysis; also, culture is not a central concept either. We suggest that issues of goal conflict, identity, and categorization, are probably strongly influenced by climatological circumstances. We have already outlined that scarcity of resources may be determined by climate, and it is easy to imagine that groups in particular have realistic conflicts about resources. Such reasoning finds home in evolutionary theorizing as well, such that genetic outcomes are strongly conditioned by the groups who do better at dealing with scarcity of resources.
