<p class="p">In the final analysis, these are empirical issues that would energize new tests of the reach and limitations of realistic conflict theory or social identity theory. For example, in cross-national research, it could be examined whether climate, especially average temperature and seasonal variation in temperature, is predictive of thinking and acting in terms of in-groups and out-groups. This follows from the simple CLASH model. If it is climate-related poverty and scarcity that trigger conflicting goals among groups, then realistic group conflict would be essential in the conceptual analysis of intergroup conflict. This follows from the extended CLASH model.</p>
