<p class="p">Perhaps the most challenging societal issues of recent times are the refugee crisis (at least in Europe) and climate change. These two issues are not independent. There is good reason to believe that the refugee crisis is in part fuelled by global warming—perhaps along with the prospect of more global warming in the future. An intriguing issue for future study would be to examine whether cultural differences in planning continue to exist. For example, will people from locations with less seasonal variation in temperature become more concerned with time as they move to locations with greater seasonal variation in temperature? Also, how do people deal with dual identities after migration? For example, do immigrants from Turkey who live in Germany feel Turkish, German, or both? It is possible that many feelings related to the past—nostalgia—are also climate-related (e.g., “it was so nice to be outside all the time”) and are central to their identities. It is useful to recognize that many aspects of everyday life are linked to climate—what clothes we wear, whether we expect it to rain, how much time we spend outdoors versus indoors. The recognition of climate-related differences might be helpful to understand some differences in culture. And given that climate differences are stable and pervasive, it makes sense that immigrants to a new country need time to adjust to climate differences, as well as the host of psychological variables that are linked to climate, such as differences in time orientation. Needless to say, these are important topics in an era of migration, an era of climate change, and an era in which the world becomes smaller and smaller.</p>
