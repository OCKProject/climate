<p class="p">For example, consider homicide rates around the world. When looking at the global map of homicide (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1368430217735579" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), two features are especially striking. First, homicide rates vary dramatically around the world. For example, homicide rates per 100,000 people in Honduras (84.6), South Africa (33.0), or Brazil (24.6) are many times higher than in Japan (0.3), Australia (1.0), or the US (3.9). Second, homicide rates tend to be higher near the equator (

There are exceptions to this general trend, such as the high homicide rate in Russia (north of the equator) and in South Africa (south of the equator). Of course, it is also hotter near the equator, where violence levels also tend to “flare.” Hot temperatures are often associated with higher aggression and violence levels. For example, a recent meta-analysis involving 56 cross-national studies found that various forms of aggression and violence across a variety of temporal and spatial scales are higher in countries with higher average temperatures (
 <xref rid="bibr13-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burke, Hsiang, &amp; Miguel, 2015</xref>). These patterns are quite strong: climate is associated with violence in 46 of 56 (82%) of published studies, and temperature is associated with violence in 20 out of 24 studies (83%; see 
 <xref rid="bibr13-1368430217735579" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burke et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, effects were stronger for temperature than for rainfall, and were stronger for aggression and violence between groups than between individuals. One standard deviation increase in temperature was associated with an 11.3% increase in intergroup conflict but only a 2.1% increase in interpersonal conflict. These findings are of special import to readers of this journal, who are interested in intergroup relations.
