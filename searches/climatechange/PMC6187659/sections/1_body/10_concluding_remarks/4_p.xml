<p class="p">We do not think that climate should be put to a competitive test with other, more proximal variables that influence aggression and violence. Although competitive testing is a natural inclination of many scientists, in the natural world individuals 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> groups adapt to stable features of the environment. Climate is clearly one of these stable features, perhaps the most stable of all, especially prior to 1950. Many other variables, from poverty to migration, from colonization to parasite stress, and from income inequality to governance, are likely to vary as a function of climate. Even if psychology is only one of the disciplines explaining the consequences of climate for society and culture, we believe psychology can make a unique and important contribution. We hope CLASH can help to make a creative and important contribution to understanding and reducing the level of conflict, aggression, and violence in the world, especially between groups. Creative solutions are required because our planet has a fever, and is getting hotter and hotter over time.
