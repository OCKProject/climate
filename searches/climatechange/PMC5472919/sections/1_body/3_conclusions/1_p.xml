 <italic class="italic">L. stagnalis</italic> snails responded to an experimental heat wave by increasing reproduction and size while reducing expression of immune defence traits. Most of these traits showed high family-level variation at both control and heat wave temperatures. However, responses to the high temperature were similar in most traits across different families (i.e. parallel reaction norms). Only PO-like activity showed family-level variation in reaction norms between temperatures, which suggests that the cost snails need to pay for increased reproduction and size shows genetic variation and thus potential for adaptive evolution. The only genetic trade-off was found at the high temperature. Thus, our results suggest abundant adaptive potential in the examined traits, but only limited genetic variation in their thermal reaction norms.
