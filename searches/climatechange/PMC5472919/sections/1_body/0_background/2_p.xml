<p class="p">A necessary prerequisite for evolutionary change by means of natural selection is within-population heritable genetic variation in the traits subject to selection. Typically, fitness-related traits are considered to show heritable variation and thus evolutionary potential in nature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. This is also the case with some of the traits examined under climate-change mediated selection since phenological traits often show significant heritability (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]). Studies on key defence traits against altered climatic conditions (e.g. heat and desiccation resistance), however, indicate limited or even complete lack of genetic variation (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>], but see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]). Furthermore, even if the traits under selection are heritable, the expression of genetic variation in them may be environment-dependent so that genetic variation found under benign environmental conditions is reduced in challenging environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Thus, if environmental change that leads to strong selection also reduces the expression of genetic variation, this will limit its expected response to selection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Similarly, the strength and/or sign of genetic covariation among traits may change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], which could also affect trait evolution under climate change conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>].
