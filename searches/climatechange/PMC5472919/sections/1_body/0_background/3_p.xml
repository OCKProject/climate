<p class="p">So far, few empirical studies have examined genetic variation in organisms’ performance in relation to changing climatic conditions (see references above), and they have focused on a limited set of traits (mainly phenology). Therefore, a need to investigate adaptability to climate change across a broader range of traits as well as organisms remains. It is especially important to consider evolutionary potential in life-history traits and defences against natural enemies (e.g. parasites) since they can strongly influence organisms’ fitness both directly and through species interactions. Here, we experimentally examined within-population genetic variation at family level in such traits at typical and heat wave temperatures as well as in their thermal reaction norms between the temperature treatments in a freshwater snail,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. We quantified snail size, fecundity and immune function because of their high importance for fitness and their potential to alter species interactions (host–parasite relationships). Using multiple traits also allowed us to test environment-dependence of family-level covariation among them.
