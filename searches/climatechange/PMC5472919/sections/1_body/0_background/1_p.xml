<p class="p">Natural populations of numerous species are currently threatened by anthropogenic environmental changes such as habitat loss, chemical pollution, and invasive species. One of the factors with wide ecological effects is global climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Climate change is a major threat for the Earth’s biodiversity, and the persistence of many populations will depend on their ability to respond to changing climatic conditions by means of (1) range shifts, (2) phenotypic plasticity, and/or (3) evolutionary adaptations. Of these, evolutionary adaptations are potentially of very high importance since climate change imposes intensified and novel selective pressures on organisms. This is true even in the case of range shifts and phenotypic plasticity because first, individuals that disperse into new areas are likely to experience altered selection owing to, for instance, different photoperiod (determined by latitude) and species interactions (all species are unlikely to disperse the same way) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Second, phenotypic plasticity is unlikely to be optimal outside those environmental conditions under which it evolved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>] and it may be costly, with negative fitness effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
