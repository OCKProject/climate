<p class="p">To analyse the variation in snail size and immune parameters (haemocyte concentration, PO-like activity, antibacterial activity of haemolymph) we used similar ANOVAs as above. To meet the assumptions of ANOVA, we ln transformed haemocyte concentration and PO-like activity. When statistically significant temperature-by-family interactions were observed in the above analyses, we analysed the variation in response variables separately for different temperatures. We did this to examine whether family-level variation was observed under both environmental conditions. Snails that did not reproduce were excluded from the analyses of snail size and immune parameters. This was done because reproduction can be traded off with these traits [
