<p class="p">In addition to the above ANOVAs, we examined the variation in responses of snails to temperature treatments by analysing the data using the approach in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]. We formed random pairs of snails between temperature treatments within each family by block combination, and subtracted the trait values (egg number was standardized as described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>]) of the snail maintained at 15 °C from those of the snail maintained at 25 °C in each pair. We then analysed the variation in calculated differences in each trait using ANOVAs with family and block as random factors. As this approach gave qualitatively similar results compared to the G × E interactions in the above ANOVAs, these results are not presented.
