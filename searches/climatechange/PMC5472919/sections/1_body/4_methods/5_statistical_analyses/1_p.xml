<p class="p">We performed all statistical analyses using IBM SPSS 23.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) software. To examine the effect of temperature on the probability of snails reproducing during the experiment, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with the reproductive status of snails (oviposited, did not oviposit) as a binomial response variable. In the analysis, we used temperature as a fixed factor. Since there was no variation in some families and blocks (i.e. all individuals reproduced) we could not include family and block as factors in the model. After that, we analysed the variation in the number of oviposited eggs using only those snails that reproduced using an ANOVA. In the model, we used temperature as a fixed and family as a random factor. Additionally, we included the main effect of block (random factor) to reduce possible noise in the data that could arise from examining the snails on different days. To meet the assumptions of ANOVA, we ln transformed the number of produced eggs.</p>
