<p class="p">To estimate the reproductive output of snails, we collected all the egg clutches oviposited by the snails during the experiment and photographed them from approximately 10 cm above with a Fujifilm FinePix F30 digital camera (scene mode: close up, focal length: 35 mm, aperture: F/2.8, shutter speed: 1/85, sensitivity: ISO-200, image size: 2848 × 2136 pixels, focus mode: auto focus). From each picture, we measured the two-dimensional area of the clutch that contained eggs using ImageJ software (ImageJ 1.42q, Wayne Rasband, National Institute of Health, USA). Then, we measured the area containing 10 eggs in each clutch and calculated an estimate of the total number of eggs in the clutch. We summed up the number of eggs in the clutches oviposited by each snail to get a measure of its reproductive output during the experiment.</p>
