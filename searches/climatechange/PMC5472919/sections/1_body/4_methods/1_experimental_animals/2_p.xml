<p class="p">The snails we used for breeding experimental snails came from a laboratory stock population (F
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> generation) originating from a pond in Zürich, Switzerland (47°22′ N, 8°34′ E). In this region, the summer water temperature in ponds typically remains low (&lt; 16 °C), although it depends on the hydrology of the ponds (T. Salo, 2015, unpublished data). During heat waves, water temperature can, however, rapidly increase to 20–30 °C and remain high for over 2 weeks (T. Salo, 2015, unpublished data). To start the stock population, we collected 45 adult snails from the pond. Since

We maintained the stock population at 15 ± 2 °C (control temperature used in the experiment; see below) and kept its size at approximately 400 individuals to avoid loss of genetic polymorphism due to genetic drift (see [
