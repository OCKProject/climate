<p class="p">Using maternal sibships, our goal was to estimate whether the responses of snails to high temperatures vary across different genetic backgrounds (i.e. families), and how much of the phenotypic variation in the examined traits is expressed at the family level. It is important to note, however, that variation among maternal sibships may not directly reflect the amount of additive genetic variation in the examined traits. This is because variation among families could also be due to other genetic factors such as dominance variance, and/or due to non-genetic maternal effects (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]). It is also possible that some families may have been multiply sired (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>]). In our study system, however, phenotypic variation in immune function across full-sib families is known to reflect variation in the genetic background of snails rather than variation in non-genetic maternal effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the examined immune traits do not respond to inbreeding, which indicates a lack of directional dominance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. If multiple paternities within family lines were common, then the chances of finding differences among families would be reduced because among-family variation would be confounded by increased within-family variation.
