<p class="p">The hermaphroditic snail 
 <italic class="italic">L. stagnalis</italic> inhabits lakes and ponds throughout the Holarctic region. When exposed to high temperatures it is known to initially increase reproduction and growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. After 1 week, however, high reproductive rate ceases and the immune function weakens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]. This indicates that snails are not able to maintain increased performance when exposed to high temperatures over long time periods. 
 <italic class="italic">L. stagnalis</italic> is an important host for various parasites, including several highly virulent trematode species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] that castrate the snails and increase their mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Thus, the reduced immune defence of snails at high temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>] can have wide implications for natural snail populations.
