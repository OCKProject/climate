<p class="p">We haphazardly collected 15 adult snails (shell length &gt; 20 mm) from the stock population to produce experimental snails. We maintained these snails individually in 0.2 L perforated plastic cups that were sunk into a water bath (15 ± 1 °C) connected to a biological filter. We fed the snails with fresh lettuce ad libitum and maintained them until each of them had produced two egg clutches (&gt; 30 eggs per clutch). We used these clutches to obtain family lines (maternal sibships) for the experiment and transferred each clutch individually into plastic containers with 6 L of aged tap water (15 ± 1 °C). After the juveniles hatched, we fed them with 
 <italic class="italic">Spirulina</italic> until they reached approximately 5 mm shell length. After that, we fed the snails with spinach and lettuce ad libitum
 <italic class="italic">.</italic> We changed water in the containers once a week. When the snails from all families were mature (shell length &gt; 20 mm), we randomly chose 40 snails per family and placed them individually in 0.2 L perforated plastic cups sunk into a water bath (15 ± 1 °C) as above. Since pathogen resistance in snails may show age-related patterns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">59</xref>], it is important to note that the difference in age of the experimental snails was not more than a week. We fed the snails with fresh lettuce ad libitum for 5 days before the experiment (see below) to acclimatize them to the experimental conditions. Since 
 <italic class="italic">L. stagnalis</italic> is a simultaneous hermaphrodite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">60</xref>] and can store allosperm for several weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>], snails did not need a mating partner to reproduce under these conditions.
