<p class="p">We measured haemocyte concentration, PO-like activity, and antibacterial activity of snail haemolymph to examine variation in snail immune function. In invertebrates, haemocytes, through phagocytosis, constitute the main part of the cellular immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Furthermore, haemocytes can synthesize pro-phenoloxidase (pro-PO), which in the active form PO catalyses oxidative defence against parasites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. Antibacterial enzymes as a further component of the innate immune defence are used against microorganisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]. We chose to measure snail immune function rather than their susceptibility to any specific parasite species because examining several immune parameters gives a broad estimate of host defences, whereas studies focusing on a certain host-parasite interaction are necessarily specific to the particular parasite species being used. Such studies can also be confounded by the direct effects of temperature on parasite transmission stages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]. The examined immune parameters are central in the immune system of invertebrates, including molluscs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>] and are known to respond to various immune elicitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>] as well as to be subject to natural selection [
