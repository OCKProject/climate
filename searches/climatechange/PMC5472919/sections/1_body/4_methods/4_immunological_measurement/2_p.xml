<p class="p">We took the haemolymph samples and measured the immune parameters as described in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. Briefly, we collected haemolymph by gently tapping the underside of the snail’s foot until it retreated into its shell, simultaneously releasing haemolymph through hemal pore [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">75</xref>]. We counted the haemocyte concentration of haemolymph (cells per μl) using a Neubauer haemocytometer (Blau Brand, Wertheim, Germany), and measured its PO-like and antibacterial activity spectrophotometrically using a microtiter plate reader (Infinite 200, Tecan, Salzburg, Austria). For the measurements of PO-like activity, we mixed haemolymph samples with L-Dopa, and measured the increase in optical density (OD) of the solution followed by an enzymatic reaction in which PO oxidizes L-Dopa to dopachrom. For the measurements of antibacterial activity, we mixed haemolymph samples with lyophilized
