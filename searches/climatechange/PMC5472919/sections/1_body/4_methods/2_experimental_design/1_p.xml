<p class="p">We maintained the snails as described above and randomly exposed them to two different temperature treatments (15 ± 1 °C and 25 ± 1 °C). We chose 25 °C as a high (i.e. heat wave) temperature as it lies above the thermal optimum of snails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>] and occurs intermittently in ponds inhabited by snails during hot summers (see above). We used 15 °C as a control temperature as it is close to the thermal optimum of snails [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>] and common in ponds (see above). At the beginning of the experiment, we transferred the snails to their treatment temperatures in cups filled with aged tap water at 15 °C. This allowed a slow change to the target temperature for snails exposed to the high temperature treatment (over 10 h). We then exposed snails to their respective temperature treatments for 7 days. We chose a one-week exposure time as it represents a typical heat wave in Western Europe (average: 8.4 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]) and because the negative effects of high temperature on snails appear at that point [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]. After that we measured the shell length (to the nearest 0.1 mm), reproduction and immune function (described below) of each snail.
