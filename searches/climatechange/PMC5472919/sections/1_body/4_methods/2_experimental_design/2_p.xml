<p class="p">To examine whether possible family-level variation in traits studied could be due to differences in neutral genetic variation caused, for example, by inbreeding, we assessed heterozygosity at microsatellite loci in snail families, as described in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>. We also followed the survival of the snails daily throughout the experiment. Since the mortality of snails during the experiment was generally low [three snails (0.5% of all individuals) died during the experiment], survival could not be used as a response variable to examine the effects of experimental treatments. Additionally, not all traits could be measured from 23 snails (3.8% of all individuals) because of human errors during the measurements. We excluded these snails from the data. We conducted the experiment in six blocks, each of which consisted of three to four snails per family by treatment combination. We started the blocks on six consecutive days.
