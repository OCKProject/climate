<p class="p">In our study, genetic correlations between the examined traits indicated a genetic trade-off only between reproduction and antibacterial activity of haemolymph. Interestingly, this negative genetic correlation appeared only at the high temperature. The emergence of trade-offs when exposed to challenging conditions could be due to resources becoming scarce when protection and repair mechanisms are activated, which can lead to allocation trade-offs among traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. A potential evolutionary consequence of such environment-dependent trade-offs is limited responses of traits to selection under climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. In this study, negative genetic correlations were scarce, and thus adaptation processes at high temperatures may not be significantly limited by trade-offs in this system. It is, however, possible that the examined traits are traded off with some other traits.
