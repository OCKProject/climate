<p class="p">We found high family-level variation, suggesting genetic variation and thus adaptive potential in all examined traits in both temperature treatments. It is important to note that in studies utilising maternal sibships, such variation could arise not only due to additive genetic variance but also due to dominance variance and/or non-genetic maternal effects (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]). In our study system, however, the latter effects have been reported to be very weak in determining the variation in the examined traits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. In studies conducted using other organisms, the effect of challenging environmental conditions on the amount of genetic variation in key life history traits in natural populations has been shown to vary [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. However, most studies have reported only limited genetic variation in growth and reproduction of organisms under harsh environmental conditions (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]). This indicates that lack of adaptive potential could prevent evolutionary responses to climate-mediated selection in many species. For instance, in 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila</italic>, especially species with narrow geographical distribution show very little genetic variation in desiccation and cold resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. In other taxa, also widely distributed species show genetic limitations for evolutionary responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Possible reasons for this are, among others, local adaptation, bottleneck events, or historical events of strong directional selection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>].
