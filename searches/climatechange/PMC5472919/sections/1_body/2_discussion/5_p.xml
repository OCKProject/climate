<p class="p">In spite of high family-level variation in the examined traits, genetic variation in their responses to the high temperature was limited (i.e. reaction norms between the temperatures were largely parallel). This is in line with studies on birds that found plastic responses, but little evidence for heritability of the slope of thermal reaction norms for reproductive traits such as laying date and clutch size, which indicates limited potential for temperature-mediated evolutionary responses in these traits (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]). However, in other studies, genetic variation in thermal reaction norms for life history traits (e.g. growth rate, timing of reproduction) is found and is suggested to provide the genetic potential for adaptive responses to high temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. We found family-level variation in the response of snails to a heat wave temperature only in one of the examined immune traits (PO-like activity). This suggests that the price snails need to pay for increased size and reproduction by compromising immune defence may be variable across individuals with different genetic backgrounds and thus show adaptive potential. Therefore, families experiencing the lowest costs may be selected for.
