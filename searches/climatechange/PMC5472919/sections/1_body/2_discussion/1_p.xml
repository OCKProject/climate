 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. We examined family-level variation and covariation in life history and immune defence traits in a laboratory stock of a natural population of the freshwater snail 
 <italic class="italic">L. stagnalis</italic> at typical (15 °C) and heat wave (25 °C) temperatures, as well as family-level variation in the responses of these traits to the high temperature (i.e. reaction norms between the treatments). Exposure to 25 °C increased size and reproductive output of snails while immune defence (PO-like and antibacterial activity, but not haemocyte concentration of haemolymph) was reduced. We found high family-level variation in all examined traits in both temperature treatments. The observed genetic correlations among traits were mainly positive. One negative genetic correlation (between reproduction and antibacterial activity of haemolymph) was found at 25 °C. These findings suggest that high temperatures may not strongly reduce the potential of the examined traits to respond to natural selection. However, the responses of most traits to the high temperature were similar across snail families, indicated by parallel reaction norms. Only the negative effect of the high temperature on one immune defence trait (PO-like activity) showed family-level variation, which indicates that for some families the cost of exposure to high temperatures is lower and hence could be selected for.
