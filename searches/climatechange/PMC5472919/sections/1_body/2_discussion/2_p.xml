<p class="p">Temperature-induced phenotypic changes in fitness-related traits are common in nature (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]). The observed increase in the reproduction and size of snails when exposed to elevated temperatures is also found in other ectotherms (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]). These effects are most likely due to high metabolic activity, which can increase the amount of resources allocated to reproduction and growth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. The observed decrease in immune activity at the high temperature is also in line with the results from other taxa (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]) and may be due to altered resource allocation towards growth and reproduction rather than immune defence (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]). Variation in the responses of different immune parameters to high temperatures (see also [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]) could be a result of the other functions of some immune traits beside defence (e.g. involvement of haemocytes in nutrient transport and repair mechanisms), which could change the hierarchy of resource allocation among them (see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]).
