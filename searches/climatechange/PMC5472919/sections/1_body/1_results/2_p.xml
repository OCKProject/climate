<p class="p">Exposure to 25 °C reduced snail immune defences (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). However, examined immune parameters differed in their responses to temperature (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Haemocyte concentration of snail haemolymph did not differ between snails maintained at 25 °C and 15 °C, while PO-like activity and antibacterial activity were reduced at the high temperature (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). We found significant family-level variation in all immune traits (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; separate ANOVAs for PO-like activity at each temperature: 15 °C: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">14, 234</sub> = 1.743, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.048; 25 °C: 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">14, 264</sub> = 3.917, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, family-level variation in PO-like activity interacted with temperature, indicated by a significant family-by-temperature (i.e. G × E) interaction (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and crossing reaction norms between the treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>). This suggests genetic variation in the response of snails to high temperatures in this trait.
