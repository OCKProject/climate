<p class="p">Snails exposed to 25 °C were larger at the end of the study compared to snails maintained at 15 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). They were also more likely to oviposit (97.6 ± 0.9% versus 85.8 ± 2.0% at 15 °C; GLM: d.f. = 1, Wald

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Snail size and the number of oviposited eggs also showed significant family-level variation (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Their responses to the high temperature were, however, consistent across families, indicated by statistically non-significant interaction terms between temperature and family (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and mainly parallel reaction norms between the temperature treatments (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> &amp; 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
