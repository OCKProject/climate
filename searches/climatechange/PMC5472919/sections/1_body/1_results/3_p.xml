<p class="p">At 15 °C, we found significant positive genetic correlations between snail shell length and PO-like activity as well as between shell length and the number of oviposited eggs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). At 25 °C, the relationship between shell length and PO-like activity was non-significant while the observed positive genetic correlation between shell length and the number of oviposited eggs remained (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Furthermore, haemocyte concentration and PO-like activity were positively, and the number of oviposited eggs and antibacterial activity were negatively correlated at 25 °C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The observed family-level variation/covariation in the examined traits was unlikely to be due to differences in neutral genetic variation since snail families did not differ in heterozygosity, estimated using microsatellite markers (Additional file
