Given that many crops grown under rainfed conditions support the livelihoods of low-income farmers, it is important to highlight the vulnerability of rainfed areas to climate change in order to anticipate potential risks to food security. In this paper, we focus on India, where ~&#x000a0;50% of rice is grown under rainfed conditions, and we employ statistical models (climate envelope models (CEMs) and boosted regression trees (BRTs)) to map changes in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation at a regional level (~&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;km cell resolution) under projected future (2050) climate change (IPCC RCPs 2.6 and 8.5, using three GCMs: BCC-CSM1.1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and HadGEM2-ES). We quantify the occurrence of rice (whether or not rainfed rice is commonly grown, using CEMs) and rice extent (area under cultivation, using BRTs) during the summer monsoon in relation to four climate variables that affect rice growth and yield namely ratio of precipitation to evapotranspiration (<italic>PER</italic>), maximum and minimum temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub>), and total rainfall during harvesting. Our models described the occurrence and extent of rice very well (CEMs for occurrence, ensemble AUC&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.92; BRTs for extent, Pearson's r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.87). <italic>PER</italic> was the most important predictor of rainfed rice occurrence, and it was positively related to rainfed rice area, but all four climate variables were important for determining the extent of rice cultivation. Our models project that 15%&#x02013;40% of current rainfed rice growing areas will be at risk (i.e. decline in climate suitability or become completely unsuitable). However, our models project considerable variation across India in the impact of future climate change: eastern and northern India are the locations most at risk, but parts of central and western India may benefit from increased precipitation. Hence our CEM and BRT models agree on the locations most at risk, but there is less consensus about the degree of risk at these locations. Our results help to identify locations where livelihoods of low-income farmers and regional food security may be threatened in the next few decades by climate changes. The use of more drought-resilient rice varieties and better irrigation infrastructure in these regions may help to reduce these impacts and reduce the vulnerability of farmers dependent on rainfed cropping.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="ab0010"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="li0005"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Statistical models successfully map the occurrence and extent of rainfed rice in India.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Monsoon rainfall and temperature are important predictors of rainfed rice cultivation.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Climate suitability is projected to decline in 15%&#x02013;40% of rainfed rice locations by 2050.</p></list-item><list-item id="li0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Drought-resistant new crop varieties and better irrigation infrastructure may protect vulnerable farmers in these locations.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Rainfed rice</kwd><kwd>Climate envelope model</kwd><kwd>biomod2</kwd><kwd>Boosted regression trees</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Global temperatures rose above pre-industrial levels by +&#x000a0;0.85&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the last century, and are predicted to exceed +&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C this century (RCP 8.5 scenario; <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2013</xref>). There are aspirations to limit this temperature rise by reducing anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Hulme, 2016</xref>), but current global warming trends are expected to lead to a greater intensity, frequency and severity of droughts (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Diffenbaugh et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Prudhomme et al., 2014</xref>). Higher temperature and increased rainfall variability will reduce yields of major crops such as maize, wheat and rice (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Sage et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Lobell et al., 2011</xref>) (there is evidence that climate change has already begun to reduce yields (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Lesk et al., 2016</xref>)) in spite of the benefits for plants from increased atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Hasegawa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Rainfed areas supply ca. 58% of global food production and play an important role in food security (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Seck et al., 2012</xref>). Rice is one of the major crops grown and consumed in rainfed areas, and rainfed cultivation accounts for about 25% of global rice production. Due to its dependence on climate, rainfed rice cultivation is vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall. Warm temperature (optimal range 20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C&#x02013;30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) and high rainfall (optimal range 1500&#x000a0;mm&#x02013;2000&#x000a0;mm) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecocrop.fao.org/" id="ir0005">http://ecocrop.fao.org/</ext-link>) generally increase growth rates of rice plants, and hence yield (<xref rid="bb0315" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida, 1981</xref>). By contrast, very high temperatures (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) induce heat stress and affect plant physiological processes, leading to spikelet sterility, non-viable pollen and reduced grain quality (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Welch et al., 2010</xref>). Drought, on the other hand, reduces plant transpiration rates and may result in leaf rolling and drying, reduction in leaf expansion rates and plant biomass, immobilisation of solutes and increased heat stress of leaves (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Jagadish et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0285" ref-type="bibr">Van Oort et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Climate is the primary factor driving locations for rainfed rice cultivation and rice yields. Hence changes in climate, such as those projected to occur in the future, particularly those related to increased variability in rainfall (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Meinshausen et al., 2011</xref>), could result in some areas becoming climatically unsuitable for cultivating rainfed rice, or at least reduce crop yields. Statistical models have been used to map crop production in relation to climate, and to project changes in the suitability of cultivation for a wide variety of crops including cereals (<xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Jones and Thornton, 2003</xref>), spices (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Vlok and Olivier, 2003</xref>), biofuel crops (<xref rid="bb0275" ref-type="bibr">Tuck et al., 2006</xref>), and fruit (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Machovina and Feeley, 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">White et al., 2006</xref>). Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used at regional scales to map distributions of crops in relation to climate variables and, by incorporating outputs from future climate change scenarios, to make projections about changes in the suitability of cropping areas (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Estes et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Generally, outputs of CEMs are expressed in terms of spatial (usually gridded) maps of probabilities of occurrence of the crop under study, with declines in probability under future climate change implying decreasing suitability for growing crops. CEM outputs can be used to identify regions that may become climatically unsuitable in the future, and highlight vulnerable areas where crops are most at risk from the detrimental impacts of climate change (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). This mapping approach can be used at regional scales to guide policy makers in their choice of adaptation strategies, such as breeding new cultivars that can cope with the predicted climate change, developing irrigation infrastructure or shifting to new cropping systems.</p><p>In this study, we examine changes in climate suitability of rainfed rice cultivation in India, to highlight areas at risk from future climate changes. It is important to study rainfed rice cultivation here because India is the world's second largest producer of rice, of which a substantial amount is grown under rainfed conditions during the <italic>Kharif</italic> (i.e. summer monsoon season). Any detrimental impacts of climate would have major consequences for food security from local to global levels. Moreover, the majority of Indian farmers cultivating rainfed rice are smallholders, whose local livelihoods are highly vulnerable to climate changes and since 1980, the number of smallholder farmers in India increased by ~&#x000a0;77% to almost 66 million in 2010&#x02013;11(<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Joshi, 2015</xref>). In addition, the agricultural sector in India employs almost half of the labour force of the country, so any changes in rice cultivation are likely to have considerable social impacts.</p><p>We use multiple CEMs and BRTs (see <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec">Materials and methods</xref>) to model the occurrence (presence/absence) and extent (area under cultivation) of rainfed rice cultivation in relation to four climate variables during the main summer monsoon growing season (precipitation-evapotranspiration ratio, total rainfall, average minimum and maximum temperatures). Modelling continuous data, i.e. extent of rainfed rice using boosted regression trees (BRTs), as well as categorical occurrence data using CEMs, allowed us to map changes in the suitability of rainfed rice growing areas (from CEM outputs), as well as to quantify changes in the absolute area available for rainfed rice cultivation (from BRT outputs). Our study has three main aims. First, we examine whether the occurrence and extent of current-day rainfed rice cultivation can be modelled successfully using climatic variables derived from temperature and precipitation during the summer monsoon, and whether CEM and BRT model outputs agree in terms of which areas are climatically most suitable for growing rainfed rice. Second, we assess whether the models agree on which climate variables are important predictors of rainfed rice cultivation; we hypothesise here that rainfall-derived variables will be more important than temperature in this respect. Finally, we map future changes in the climate suitability of areas where rainfed rice is currently cultivated, and identify risk areas that our models project to possibly become climatically unsuitable for rainfed rice cultivation by 2050.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Sources of rice data</title><p>We modelled the occurrence (presence versus absence, categorical variable) and extent (area under cultivation, continuous variable) of rainfed rice cultivation in India. In order to generate these occurrence and extent data, we compiled existing data on the total area of rice cultivation (ha; combining irrigated and rainfed rice) and net irrigated rice area (ha) at district level (mean area of 519 districts&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5857&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>) in India. These data are for the period 1998&#x02013;2013, and are from the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eands.dacnet.nic.in/" id="ir0010">http://eands.dacnet.nic.in/</ext-link>) for the <italic>Kharif</italic> season (summer monsoon season, June&#x02013;September). For each district in India, we calculated the area of rainfed rice cultivation, by subtracting the net irrigated rice area from the total rice area for each year for the period 1998&#x02013;2013, and then averaged the annual rainfed rice area over 16&#x000a0;years to produce a single mean value for the area of rainfed rice cultivation for each district. There were changes to district boundaries over time, and new districts created during 1998&#x02013;2013 were merged with parent districts before computing rainfed rice areas in order to analyse 519 districts over time. Thus, the final computed district-level data comprised the average area under rainfed rice cultivation (in ha) for 519 districts in India (Fig. S1, Appendix A; excluding West Bengal, Tripura and the Island territories of Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep where data were unavailable). These coarse district-level data were downscaled and converted into a gridded dataset (10&#x000a0;arc-minute resolution, which is ~&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;km cell spatial resolution at the equator; Fig. S1, Appendix A) to match the resolution of the climate datasets used in this study (see below). Our downscaling methods are described in Appendix B. This downscaling resulted in a total of 9674 cells from which we excluded cells without any rainfed rice cultivation (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1700 cells) to eliminate locations where rice cannot be grown (e.g. Thar Desert).</p><p>From the remaining 7974 cells, we produced two datasets for inclusion into models; our first dataset mapped observed occurrence of rainfed rice per 18&#x000a0;km cell (binary variable; 1&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;high occurrence of rainfed rice areas, 0&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;low occurrence of rainfed rice area, subsequently termed &#x02018;presence&#x02019; and &#x02018;absence&#x02019;). All 18&#x000a0;km cells where rainfed rice occupied &#x02265;&#x000a0;15% of the cells were classified as presences (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1171 cells) and remaining cells were classified as absences (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6803 cells; <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a). Models have been generally shown to perform best when the harvested area is above 10%&#x02013;15% of the gridded area being modelled (<xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2015</xref>). We tested the sensitivity of our findings to different thresholds at 10% and 20%, and we found that our main conclusions were not largely affected by our choice of threshold value (Fig. S2, Appendix A).

There is considerable variation in future projections from different GCMs (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Jayasankar et al., 2015</xref>), and so we examined projections for 2050 for two scenarios, spanning the highest and lowest severity of future climate change, from three GCMs. IPCC RCP 8.5 represents the most severe (&#x02018;business-as-usual&#x02019;) scenario, and RCP 2.6 represents the least severe (&#x02018;mitigation&#x02019;) scenario (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">IPCC, 2013</xref>).

Finally, all three GCMs have been shown to reproduce the current regional rainfall across India, albeit with low confidence (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Menon et al., 2013</xref>).

In order to quantify the impacts of future climate changes (see <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec">Section 2.4</xref> below), these continuous probability values were transformed into categorical data (modelled presence/absence data) using a threshold probability value derived from the ROC curve (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Marzban, 2004</xref>).

Our initial data exploration indicated that the gridded extent data had a negatively skewed distribution (i.e. most cells had little rainfed rice whereas a few cells had very large amounts of rainfed rice). Therefore, we ln-transformed these data (using the transformation ln(extent&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1)) before running the BRTs (see Appendix D for BRTs details). We then back-transformed the BRT model outputs (which were on a natural logarithmic (ln) scale) and converted this continuous extent variable into a categorical variable (i.e. modelled &#x02018;high&#x02019; and &#x02018;low&#x02019; rainfed rice extent) using the same thresholding approach used for CEM outputs, derived from the ROC curve (see above; a threshold of 1517.93&#x000a0;ha of rainfed rice cultivation per cell was used for separating high extent from low extent cells).</p><p>We assessed the spatial agreement in modelled occurrence (CEMs) and extent (BRTs) of rainfed rice by mapping cells where CEM and BRT model outputs agreed/disagreed (i.e. modelled presences were in agreement with modelled high extent, and modelled absences agreed with modelled low extent).

For each GCM&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;RCP combination, we quantified changes in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation by subtracting outputs based on current climate from those based on future climate projections. A change in probability values (CEMs) or change in extent (BRTs) was taken to indicate change (either increase or decrease) in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation in the future. We focussed specifically on cells where rainfed rice cultivation is recorded in the present-day (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1171 cells, see <xref rid="s0015" ref-type="sec">Section 2.1</xref> above), because changes in climate suitability in these cells will have greatest impacts on rainfed rice production.

We combined results from the three GCMs to produce an ensemble result for each cell for each RCP.

Rice production is a function of yield, cropping area and cropping frequency, and it has been shown that changes in cropping area (and frequency) contribute more to changes in agricultural output than changes in yield (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Cohn et al., 2016</xref>). Hence our predictions, that up to 40% of existing rainfed rice areas in India may be at risk in future, highlight the considerable vulnerability of rainfed rice production to climate change.</p><sec id="s0055"><label>4.1</label><title>Declining climate suitability in important rainfed rice areas</title><p>Both CEM and BRT models project that 15%&#x02013;40% of current rainfed rice locations may be at risk from climate change by 2050, based on the consensus across multiple GCMs. These declines in suitability were most pronounced in eastern India, in the States of Odisha, Assam and Chhattisgarh. These States predominantly use rainfed cultivation methods and contribute more than a quarter of India's annual rice production. The farming communities in these States are dominated by small-landholders (usually owning &#x0003c;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;ha; <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Joshi, 2015</xref>), with little opportunity to produce surplus grain for consumption or for generating income. In addition, small-holders often have limited access to financial markets or crop insurance (<xref rid="bb0260" ref-type="bibr">Thapa and Gaiha, 2011</xref>), and so these projected climate-driven declines in rainfed rice cultivation would be expected to be detrimental to local livelihoods. Our model outputs agree with other studies projecting declines in rainfed rice yields in future, based on outputs of process-based crop models (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Rao et al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bb0255" ref-type="bibr">Soora et al., 2013</xref>) and statistical crop models (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Auffhammer et al., 2012</xref>). Rainfed areas already have a large yield gap compared with irrigated areas (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2012</xref>) and further reductions in the extent of climatically-suitable areas could widen these yield gaps with negative consequences for regional food security (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Aggarwal et al., 2008</xref>). Both CEMs and BRTs identified similar areas at risk in the states of Chhattisgarh and Odisha, although they differ in the projected severity of risk in these locations (i.e. they differ in the number of cells projected to become less suitable or unsuitable in future). The major difference between the projections for the two approaches across the GCM ensemble is that CEMs project more cells becoming less suitable but with high confidence, whereas BRTs project more cells to be unsuitable but with only medium confidence. This difference in model outputs could be due to differences in the climate variables deemed as the most influential by the two approaches (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s0060"><label>4.2</label><title>Rainfall is generally more important than temperature-derived variables for mapping rainfed rice areas</title><p>The CEM and BRT models were very good at mapping rainfed rice at a regional (~&#x000a0;18&#x000a0;km cell) scale using only monsoon climate variables, confirming the dependency of rainfed rice cultivation on climate. Of the four climate variables included in our models, <italic>PER</italic> was the most important for mapping the occurrence of rainfed rice using CEMs, but all four variables were important for projecting extent of rainfed rice cultivation using BRTs, although there was some indication that rainfall variables were slightly more important. Previous studies have shown that monsoon rainfall affects important decisions such as planting dates (<xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2016</xref>) and choice of rice cultivar (<xref rid="bb0310" ref-type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2014</xref>), and that rainfall is also important for other rainfed crops such as wheat (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Mavromatis, 2016</xref>), sunflowers (<xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Valverde et al., 2015</xref>), and sorghum (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Alemaw and Simalenga, 2015</xref>). It is most likely that planting decisions by farmers are based on monsoon conditions in the initial growing periods (<italic>PER</italic> and <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>max</italic></sub>) as opposed to variables during the final growing periods (<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>min</italic></sub> and <italic>Rain</italic>), which may explain why <italic>PER</italic> was the most important predictor in CEMs, and why there was more spatial consensus in outputs from CEMs than from BRTs. <italic>PER</italic> is a ratio of rainfall and potential evapotranspiration, both of which are expected to increase in the future, although projections for rainfall are less certain (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Jayasankar et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">Sharmila et al., 2015</xref>) than those for temperature (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chaturvedi et al., 2012</xref>). However, increased temperatures will increase potential evapotranspiration and hence reduce water available to plants, showing that both rainfall and temperature changes are important. Nonetheless, since GCMs have less agreement on future rainfall patterns compared with temperature, any model that relies predominantly on rainfall, rather than <italic>PER</italic> which combines rainfall and temperature, might be expected to show more spatial heterogeneity across different GCMs. This explanation could be why there was less consensus for BRTs (i.e. fewer high confidence cells) compared with CEMs.</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><label>4.3</label><title>Use of statistical models to map areas at risk</title><p>Statistical models are usually important tools for undertaking regional studies similar to ours if sufficient fine-scale data are unavailable.

We recommend running finer scale processed-based models (e.g. DSSAT; <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Corbeels et al., 2016</xref>) to examine if the conclusions we have obtained using low data-intensive statistical models are in agreement with projections from more mechanistic models that include physiological, genetic, soil and management information for rice.

In addition, some areas which currently do not cultivate rainfed rice may potentially become climatically suitable in future.

In addition, many of these potential new areas are already cultivating irrigated rice (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Nirmalendu et al., 2016</xref>) or supporting other land-uses such as forests and urban areas (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Pandey and Seto, 2015</xref>).

Hence we conclude that any benefits from increased climate suitability are unlikely to compensate for large&#x02013;scale declines in the occurrence and extent of rainfed rice cultivation that our models project in future, and that local communities, especially in north-eastern states of India, are particularly vulnerable to climate changes.</p></sec><sec id="s0075"><label>4.5</label><title>Adaptation options for lowering the risk in climatically unsuitable locations</title><p>Our models map regions at risk from future climate change, and regional food security and local livelihoods in these high risk areas will depend largely on the capacity of small holders to adapt to these climate changes, for example by the take-up of new drought-tolerant cultivars, or improved management practise.
