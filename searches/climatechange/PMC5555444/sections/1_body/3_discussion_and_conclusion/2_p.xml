<p class="p">Rainfed food production systems are highly dependent on climate and our study maps the locations where the production of rainfed rice is at risk from future climate change. Our results predict that between 15% and 40% of locations where rainfed rice is currently grown may be less suitable or even unsuitable for that method of agriculture by 2050. Rice production is a function of yield, cropping area and cropping frequency, and it has been shown that changes in cropping area (and frequency) contribute more to changes in agricultural output than changes in yield (
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cohn et al., 2016</xref>). Hence our predictions, that up to 40% of existing rainfed rice areas in India may be at risk in future, highlight the considerable vulnerability of rainfed rice production to climate change.
