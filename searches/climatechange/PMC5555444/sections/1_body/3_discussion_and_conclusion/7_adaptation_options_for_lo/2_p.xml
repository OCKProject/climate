<p class="p">Our models map regions at risk from future climate change, and regional food security and local livelihoods in these high risk areas will depend largely on the capacity of small holders to adapt to these climate changes, for example by the take-up of new drought-tolerant cultivars, or improved management practise. The development of irrigation systems would reduce the dependence on rainfall and would also enable the planting of high-yielding rice varieties (
