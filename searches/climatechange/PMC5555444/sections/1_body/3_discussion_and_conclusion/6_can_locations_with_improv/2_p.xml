<p class="p">Although our CEM and BRT models projected large areas to decline in climate suitability, some areas are projected to have improved climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation in future. In addition, some areas which currently do not cultivate rainfed rice may potentially become climatically suitable in future. However, it is unlikely that any increases in new locations will offset the declines in existing rainfed rice growing areas, because local communities in these new areas may not practise agriculture, or rice may not constitute a major part of local diets and there may be a preference for other cash crops in these areas (

 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semwal et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, many of these potential new areas are already cultivating irrigated rice (

 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Conway and Toenniessen, 1999</xref>) or already grow irrigated rice, and improved climate suitability may offer small additional returns in these locations, unless supported by new rice cultivars or irrigation infrastructure. Hence we conclude that any benefits from increased climate suitability are unlikely to compensate for largeâ€“scale declines in the occurrence and extent of rainfed rice cultivation that our models project in future, and that local communities, especially in north-eastern states of India, are particularly vulnerable to climate changes.
