<p class="p">Statistical models are usually important tools for undertaking regional studies similar to ours if sufficient fine-scale data are unavailable. Our statistical models used averaged decadal measures of rice cultivation and climate rather than yearly or finer temporal scale information as used in process-based crop models (e.g.

 <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rao et al., 2016</xref>). By aggregating data, our statistical models provide information on changes in the suitability of rice cultivation at relatively large spatial scales, and so provide risk maps rather than predictions of short-term changes in yield at specific locations. We recommend running finer scale processed-based models (e.g. DSSAT; 
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Corbeels et al., 2016</xref>) to examine if the conclusions we have obtained using low data-intensive statistical models are in agreement with projections from more mechanistic models that include physiological, genetic, soil and management information for rice. Studies that combine the two modelling approaches may provide more robust projections about changes to rice yields and areas suitable for cultivation (
