<p class="p">In this study, we examine changes in climate suitability of rainfed rice cultivation in India, to highlight areas at risk from future climate changes. It is important to study rainfed rice cultivation here because India is the world's second largest producer of rice, of which a substantial amount is grown under rainfed conditions during the

Moreover, the majority of Indian farmers cultivating rainfed rice are smallholders, whose local livelihoods are highly vulnerable to climate changes and since 1980, the number of smallholder farmers in India increased by ~ 77% to almost 66 million in 2010–11(
