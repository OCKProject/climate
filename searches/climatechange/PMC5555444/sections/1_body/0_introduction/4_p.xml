<p class="p">Climate is the primary factor driving locations for rainfed rice cultivation and rice yields. Hence changes in climate, such as those projected to occur in the future, particularly those related to increased variability in rainfall (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Meinshausen et al., 2011</xref>), could result in some areas becoming climatically unsuitable for cultivating rainfed rice, or at least reduce crop yields. Statistical models have been used to map crop production in relation to climate, and to project changes in the suitability of cultivation for a wide variety of crops including cereals (

 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">White et al., 2006</xref>). Climate envelope models (CEMs) have been used at regional scales to map distributions of crops in relation to climate variables and, by incorporating outputs from future climate change scenarios, to make projections about changes in the suitability of cropping areas (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Estes et al., 2013</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Generally, outputs of CEMs are expressed in terms of spatial (usually gridded) maps of probabilities of occurrence of the crop under study, with declines in probability under future climate change implying decreasing suitability for growing crops. CEM outputs can be used to identify regions that may become climatically unsuitable in the future, and highlight vulnerable areas where crops are most at risk from the detrimental impacts of climate change (
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). This mapping approach can be used at regional scales to guide policy makers in their choice of adaptation strategies, such as breeding new cultivars that can cope with the predicted climate change, developing irrigation infrastructure or shifting to new cropping systems.
