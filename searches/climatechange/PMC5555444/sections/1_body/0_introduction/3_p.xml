<p class="p">Rainfed areas supply ca. 58% of global food production and play an important role in food security (
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Seck et al., 2012</xref>). Rice is one of the major crops grown and consumed in rainfed areas, and rainfed cultivation accounts for about 25% of global rice production. Due to its dependence on climate, rainfed rice cultivation is vulnerable to changes in temperature and rainfall. Warm temperature (optimal range 20 °C–30 °C) and high rainfall (optimal range 1500 mm–2000 mm) (
