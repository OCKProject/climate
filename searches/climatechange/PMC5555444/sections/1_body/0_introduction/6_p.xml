<p class="p">We use multiple CEMs and BRTs (see 
 <xref rid="s0010" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Materials and methods</xref>) to model the occurrence (presence/absence) and extent (area under cultivation) of rainfed rice cultivation in relation to four climate variables during the main summer monsoon growing season (precipitation-evapotranspiration ratio, total rainfall, average minimum and maximum temperatures). Modelling continuous data, i.e. extent of rainfed rice using boosted regression trees (BRTs), as well as categorical occurrence data using CEMs, allowed us to map changes in the suitability of rainfed rice growing areas (from CEM outputs), as well as to quantify changes in the absolute area available for rainfed rice cultivation (from BRT outputs). Our study has three main aims. First, we examine whether the occurrence and extent of current-day rainfed rice cultivation can be modelled successfully using climatic variables derived from temperature and precipitation during the summer monsoon, and whether CEM and BRT model outputs agree in terms of which areas are climatically most suitable for growing rainfed rice. Second, we assess whether the models agree on which climate variables are important predictors of rainfed rice cultivation; we hypothesise here that rainfall-derived variables will be more important than temperature in this respect. Finally, we map future changes in the climate suitability of areas where rainfed rice is currently cultivated, and identify risk areas that our models project to possibly become climatically unsuitable for rainfed rice cultivation by 2050.
