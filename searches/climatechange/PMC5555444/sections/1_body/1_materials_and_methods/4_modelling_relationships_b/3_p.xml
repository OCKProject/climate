<p class="p">We modelled the extent of rainfed rice cultivation using BRTs (
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Elith et al., 2008</xref>). Our initial data exploration indicated that the gridded extent data had a negatively skewed distribution (i.e. most cells had little rainfed rice whereas a few cells had very large amounts of rainfed rice). Therefore, we ln-transformed these data (using the transformation ln(extent + 1)) before running the BRTs (see Appendix D for BRTs details). We then back-transformed the BRT model outputs (which were on a natural logarithmic (ln) scale) and converted this continuous extent variable into a categorical variable (i.e. modelled ‘high’ and ‘low’ rainfed rice extent) using the same thresholding approach used for CEM outputs, derived from the ROC curve (see above; a threshold of 1517.93 ha of rainfed rice cultivation per cell was used for separating high extent from low extent cells).
