<p class="p">We modelled the occurrence (presence/absence) of rainfed rice with the biomod2 package in R using five CEMs (MAXENT, GBM, ANN, SRE and MARS) (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thuiller et al., 2009</xref>). All five models were trained on 75% of these occurrence data and tested on the remaining 25% (repeated three times per model), and model performances were assessed by AUC values from the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marzban, 2004</xref>). For models displaying AUC &gt; 0.85, the CEM outputs reported the mean probability (averaged across the five models) of rainfed rice occurrence (0 = unsuitable, to 1 = suitable) for each of the 7974 study cells. In order to quantify the impacts of future climate changes (see 
 <xref rid="s0030" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.4</xref> below), these continuous probability values were transformed into categorical data (modelled presence/absence data) using a threshold probability value derived from the ROC curve (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marzban, 2004</xref>). The threshold value (0.17) was selected as the probability value at which sensitivity (number of observed presences predicted correctly) and specificity (number of observed absences predicted correctly) were maximised using the pROC package in R (
 <xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Robin et al., 2011</xref>). Transforming probability values from CEMs into categorical presence/absence data allowed us to compare modelled and observed occurrence data, and to facilitate comparisons of outputs from CEMs and boosted regression trees (BRTs, see below) in order to assess spatial agreement between the two methods.
