<p class="p">We assessed the spatial agreement in modelled occurrence (CEMs) and extent (BRTs) of rainfed rice by mapping cells where CEM and BRT model outputs agreed/disagreed (i.e. modelled presences were in agreement with modelled high extent, and modelled absences agreed with modelled low extent). We also assessed the relative importance of the four climate variables using the inbuilt functions for CEMs and BRTs (

 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Friedman and Meulman, 2003</xref>). For CEMs, the relative importance of each climate variable was determined by making predictions based on including only a single climate variable into models and computing the correlation (Pearson's r) between these model outputs and models that include all four climate variables. The highest value of Pearson's r is obtained for the climate variable that has the most influence (

For BRTs, the importance of a climate variable in a single regression tree was determined from improvements at each split in the tree, and the relative importance of each climate variable is the averaged improvement over all the trees where the climate variable was used for splitting (
