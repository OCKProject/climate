 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>). There is considerable variation in future projections from different GCMs (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jayasankar et al., 2015</xref>), and so we examined projections for 2050 for two scenarios, spanning the highest and lowest severity of future climate change, from three GCMs. IPCC RCP 8.5 represents the most severe (‘business-as-usual’) scenario, and RCP 2.6 represents the least severe (‘mitigation’) scenario (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2013</xref>). We obtained RCP 2.6 and 8.5 climate data from three different GCMs (BCC-CSM1.1, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, and HadGEM2-ES), selected to encompass a range of different modelling approaches and projections. These GCMs have been shown to be largely independent from each other (
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Knutti et al., 2013</xref>) and encompass a range of different modelling approaches. In addition, these GCMs project a range of different trajectories for the Indian monsoon in the future: HadGEM2-ES predicts decreased variability in the Indian monsoon, MIROC-ESM-CHEM predicts little change from the present day whereas BCC-CSM1.1 predicts increased variability in future (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jayasankar et al., 2015</xref>). Finally, all three GCMs have been shown to reproduce the current regional rainfall across India, albeit with low confidence (
 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menon et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, using climate projections from multiple GCMs and RCPs allowed us to incorporate uncertainties associated with rainfall in our mapping of risk.
