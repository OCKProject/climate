<p class="p">We examined the impact of four climate variables known to have important effects on rice growth, development and ripening (
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Rice plant sensitivity to temperature and moisture varies during the different plant growth stages, and so we split our growing season into two periods: June–September (plant growth and reproductive stage) and October–November (grain ripening and harvesting) following 
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Auffhammer et al. (2012)</xref>. The exact timing of these periods differs across India depending on monsoon onset and rice planting dates, but these periods broadly correspond with the main rice growing periods during the summer monsoon. There are &gt; 400 rice varieties cultivated in rainfed regions in India (

Thus, we split the growing season in two stages, to cover the likely growth and ripening periods of the most common rice varieties (
