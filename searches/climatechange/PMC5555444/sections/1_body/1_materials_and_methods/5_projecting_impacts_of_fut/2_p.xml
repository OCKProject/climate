<p class="p">We incorporated outputs for 2050 from two IPCC RCPs scenarios (2.6. and 8.5, representing the lowest and highest radiative forcing) and from three climate models: BCC-CSM1.1, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM-CHEM. For each GCM × RCP combination, we quantified changes in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation by subtracting outputs based on current climate from those based on future climate projections. A change in probability values (CEMs) or change in extent (BRTs) was taken to indicate change (either increase or decrease) in climate suitability for rainfed rice cultivation in the future. We focussed specifically on cells where rainfed rice cultivation is recorded in the present-day (n = 1171 cells, see 
 <xref rid="s0015" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.1</xref> above), because changes in climate suitability in these cells will have greatest impacts on rainfed rice production. We classified changes in the climate suitability of these cells into three suitability categories: improved (increased probability of occurrence/extent in future), less suitable (decreased probability of occurrence/extent) and unsuitable (decreased probability of occurrence/extent below current climate thresholds for cultivation; see 
 <xref rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Section 2.3</xref>). We combined results from the three GCMs to produce an ensemble result for each cell for each RCP. If all three GCMs were in agreement (e.g. all GCMs projected the cell to become unsuitable), then we deemed the result for the cell to be ‘high confidence’, if two GCMs agreed it was ‘medium confidence’ and if all three GCMs differed, this was ‘uncertain’ (i.e. the three GCMs projected the same cell to be more suitable, less suitable and unsuitable). Cells which became less suitable or unsuitable, and for which there was high confidence in their projections, are henceforth referred to as cells ‘at risk’. All analyses were carried out in R 3.1.2 (
