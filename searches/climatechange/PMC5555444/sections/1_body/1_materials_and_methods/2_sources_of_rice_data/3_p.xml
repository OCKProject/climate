<p class="p">From the remaining 7974 cells, we produced two datasets for inclusion into models; our first dataset mapped observed occurrence of rainfed rice per 18 km cell (binary variable; 1 = high occurrence of rainfed rice areas, 0 = low occurrence of rainfed rice area, subsequently termed ‘presence’ and ‘absence’). All 18 km cells where rainfed rice occupied ≥ 15% of the cells were classified as presences (n = 1171 cells) and remaining cells were classified as absences (n = 6803 cells;

We tested the sensitivity of our findings to different thresholds at 10% and 20%, and we found that our main conclusions were not largely affected by our choice of threshold value (Fig. S2, Appendix A). Our second dataset quantified the area of rainfed rice cultivation per 18 km cell (continuous variable (ha), subsequently termed observed ‘extent’;
