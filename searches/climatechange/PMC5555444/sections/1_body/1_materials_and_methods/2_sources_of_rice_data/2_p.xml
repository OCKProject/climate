<p class="p">We modelled the occurrence (presence versus absence, categorical variable) and extent (area under cultivation, continuous variable) of rainfed rice cultivation in India. In order to generate these occurrence and extent data, we compiled existing data on the total area of rice cultivation (ha; combining irrigated and rainfed rice) and net irrigated rice area (ha) at district level (mean area of 519 districts = 5857 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in India. These data are for the period 1998–2013, and are from the Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India (

 <italic class="italic">Kharif</italic> season (summer monsoon season, June–September). For each district in India, we calculated the area of rainfed rice cultivation, by subtracting the net irrigated rice area from the total rice area for each year for the period 1998–2013, and then averaged the annual rainfed rice area over 16 years to produce a single mean value for the area of rainfed rice cultivation for each district. There were changes to district boundaries over time, and new districts created during 1998–2013 were merged with parent districts before computing rainfed rice areas in order to analyse 519 districts over time. Thus, the final computed district-level data comprised the average area under rainfed rice cultivation (in ha) for 519 districts in India (Fig. S1, Appendix A; excluding West Bengal, Tripura and the Island territories of Andaman, Nicobar and Lakshadweep where data were unavailable). These coarse district-level data were downscaled and converted into a gridded dataset (10 arc-minute resolution, which is ~ 18 km cell spatial resolution at the equator; Fig. S1, Appendix A) to match the resolution of the climate datasets used in this study (see below). Our downscaling methods are described in Appendix B. This downscaling resulted in a total of 9674 cells from which we excluded cells without any rainfed rice cultivation (n = 1700 cells) to eliminate locations where rice cannot be grown (e.g. Thar Desert).
