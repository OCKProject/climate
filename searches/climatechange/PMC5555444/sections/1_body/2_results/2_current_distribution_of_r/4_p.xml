<p class="p">Thus the CEMs and BRTs were in broad agreement in terms of the locations of climatically suitable cells for rainfed rice, but the models differed in terms of which climate variables were the most important predictors of rainfed rice cultivation. In the CEMs, 
 <italic class="italic">PER</italic> was the most influential variable and it was almost 1.5 times more important than 
 <italic class="italic">Rain</italic> and 2.5 times more important than

 <italic class="italic">Rain</italic> was the most important variable, but was only marginally more influential than
