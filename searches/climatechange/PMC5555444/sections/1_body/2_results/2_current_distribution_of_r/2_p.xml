<p class="p">Overall, the CEMs were very good at modelling the occurrence of rainfed rice in relation to the four selected climate variables (ensemble AUC = 0.92). Rainfed rice was predicted to occur in 2435 cells and be absent from 5539 cells (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>a; based on the CEM threshold probability of 0.17 to convert probability values into modelled presences and absences). Our model sensitivity was 91% (i.e. 91% of modelled presences were in agreement with observed presences) and our model specificity was 79% (79% of absences were modelled correctly). CEMs tended to predict rainfed rice in more cells than those where there were observed presences (

 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>c), we found that about a third of modelled presences were in locations with low availability of cropland. Thus our subsequent focus on examining future changes in climate suitability only in those cells where rainfed rice is present in high extent (‘presence’ cells in
