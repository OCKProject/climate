<p class="p">The BRTs were also very good at predicting the observed extent of rainfed rice (Pearson's r = 0.87 between observed and modelled extent; Fig. S3, Appendix A). The extent of rainfed rice was predicted to be high in 2408 cells and low in 5566 cells (AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 84%, specificity = 79%, based on a threshold extent of 1517.93 ha;
