<p class="p">Focussing on the cells where rice cultivation is recorded in the present-day (n = 1171 cells; see 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>a for the location of these cells), CEMs projected the average probability of rainfed rice occurrence to increase slightly under the RCP 2.6 scenario but decrease under RCP 8.5 (Fig. S5, Appendix A), whereas BRTs generally projected decreases in extent in most RCPs and GCMs (Fig. S6, Appendix A). There was variation in the projections for changes in climate suitability according to the different GCMs and CEM/BRT models. Overall, there was more agreement in the number of cells improving in climate suitability and less agreement in cells becoming less suitable or unsuitable between CEMs and BRTs. The percentage of cells becoming less suitable or unsuitable varied across the two modelling approaches: CEMs projected 39% to 57% of cells to become less suitable (depending on GCM), and 1% to 8% of cells to become unsuitable (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>a), whereas BRTs projected 29% to 42% of cells to become unsuitable and 20% to 29% of cells to become less suitable (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>b; for spatial locations of these cells, refer to Figs. S7 and S8, Appendix A). However, all three GCMs reached a consensus on whether a cell was climatically improved, less suitable or unsuitable in future in 40% (BRTs)–60% (CEMs) of cells for RCP 2.6, and between 40% (BRTs) and 70% (CEMs) of cells for RCP 8.5. We focussed on those cells that were projected to become less suitable or unsuitable in future, and where there was high confidence across the GCMs (i.e. all three GCM outputs were in agreement). These data suggest that by 2050, between 15% and 40% of locations where rainfed rice is currently cultivated could be at risk of adverse impacts of climate change, i.e. our models predict with high confidence that these locations will become either less suitable or unsuitable for rainfed rice cultivation by 2050 (
