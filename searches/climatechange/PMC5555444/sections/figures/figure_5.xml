  <p class="p">Maps showing spatial agreement in future changes in climate suitability of cells (cells becoming climatically unsuitable, less suitable or improved suitability by 2050) under RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 for CEMs and BRTs. Three GCMs (BCC-CSM1-1, HadGEM2-ES and MIROC-ESM-CHEM) were used. For a given scenario (RCP 2.6 or 8.5) and method (CEM or BRT), if outputs from the three GCMs agreed, then confidence is high. If any two GCMs agree, confidence is medium, and if no GCMs agree, it is uncertain. Panels focus on areas around Chhattisgarh and Odisha (area enclosed by the red box in the map of India) which are two major rainfed rice growing States and have large numbers of small land-holders. White areas are where there is no rainfed rice, or little rainfed rice grown (based on 15% threshold criterion;
