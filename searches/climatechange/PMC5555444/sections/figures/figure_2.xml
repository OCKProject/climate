  <p class="p">Modelled rainfed rice (a) presence/absence (from CEMs) and (b) high/low extent (from BRTs). Green and white areas show where model outputs agree with observed rainfed rice cultivation data, whereas yellow and brown areas are where models disagree with observed data. (c) Spatial agreement in CEM and BRT outputs, where green areas show agreed presences, and white areas are agreed absences. Disagreements are shown in orange (CEMs predict presence but BRTs predict low extent) and blue (CEMs predict absence but BRTs predict high extent). Data are plotted at 18Â km cell resolution. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
