  <p class="p">Future projected changes in the climate suitability of cells where rainfed rice is currently grown (n = 1171 cells) for (a) CEMs and (b) BRTs. Cells are projected to become either climatically unsuitable (brown) or less suitable (yellow), or have improved suitability (green). The bars show all combinations of RCP (2.6 and 8.5) and GCMs (BC = BCC-CSM1-1, HE = HadGEM2-ES, MI = MIROC-ESM-CHEM). These data are plotted as maps in Figs. S7 (CEMs) and S8 (BRTs) in Appendix A. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
