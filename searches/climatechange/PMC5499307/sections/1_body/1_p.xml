<p class="p">These interactions are currently under threat due to multiple environmental impacts including invasive species, habitat loss and fragmentation, and broad-scale changes in global climate (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ovaskainen et al., 2013</xref>). Facing these challenges, assessment of all the actors involved in these interactions requires creative and diverse approaches. This motivated the symposium Studying Plant–Pollinator Interactions in Changing Environments: Approaches, Lessons, and Future Directions at Botany 2016, the annual meeting of the Botanical Society of America, held in Savannah, Georgia, USA. This special issue focusing on plant–pollinator interactions facing climate change is a result of that symposium along with invited submissions from other authors.
