<p class="p">While the changes in phenology, particularly of plants, are well studied, the impacts of climate change on traits associated with pollinator attraction are less studied. It will be increasingly important to quantify these traits, as competition for pollinators is likely to increase as a result of climate changes and other environmental disruptions, such as the potential for mismatching, weakening or loss of links in plantâ€“pollinator networks, and declining pollinator diversity with a greater proportion of generalists. Two of the papers in this issue present field methods for assessment of nectar (

 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Takkis et al., 2015</xref>). Both to assess how these key resources linking plants and pollinators are being impacted by the changing climate and to support restoration efforts within the community, more frequent assessment of these traits is essential.
