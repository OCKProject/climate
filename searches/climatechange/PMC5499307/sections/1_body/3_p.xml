<p class="p">Finally, specific aspects of climate change may differ on both spatial and temporal scales. Geographically, warming is greater in the Arctic followed by northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>), making plant–pollinator mutualisms in these regions more vulnerable to disruption. Seasonally, winters are warming faster than other seasons in regions such as Northern Europe, potentially leading to reduced flowering due to a lack of sufficient vernalization in these regions (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kreyling, 2010</xref>). With shorter and warmer winters, pollinators in these regions are responding with shortened or no diapause. These changes in diapause could result in increased exposure to temperatures that are lower than the insects’ tolerable range, due to the increased frequency of extreme frosts (associated with climate change). Because the bees are no longer in diapause, this can result in increased mortality (
