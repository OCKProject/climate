<p class="p">Floral volatiles are often understudied in field ecology; in part, this may be attributed to a lack of feasible approaches for the novice. Therefore, the contribution of 
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burkle and Runyon (2017)</xref> will be particularly useful to anyone interested in quantifying floral volatiles. In their review on measuring floral scent, they provide a historical perspective, applications of current field methods to quantifying floral scent in climate change studies, many practical details for field applications, and further directions in floral scent field measurements.
