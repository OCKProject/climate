<p class="p">The first paper in this issue addresses how to effectively identify the plant community diversity of pollen collected by bees. Numerous studies of pollination networks (i.e., all plantâ€“pollinator interactions in an area) from different habitats have provided comprehensive views of how the entire community of flowering plants and their coexisting pollinators may interact (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bell and colleagues (2017)</xref> here outline a recently developed alternative approach that uses DNA barcoding to complement observational data. This approach provides not only taxonomic identities but also the diversity and relative quantity of pollen grains carried by flower visitors. It has the potential to enhance both the speed and accuracy with which plant species interacting with a particular pollinator are identified.
