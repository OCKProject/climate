<p class="p">Assessment of the abundance of beesâ€™ activity at flowers may be time-consuming but is fairly straightforward. However, quantifying only the activity of pollinators at plants does not directly quantify their phenology, and methods to accurately assess their emergence at their nests are needed. Approaches for quantifying emergence and suitable habitat for ground nesting bees are less straightforward than observation at flowers. In their contribution,
