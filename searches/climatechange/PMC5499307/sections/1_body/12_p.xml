<p class="p">A comprehensive assessment of the impact of climate change on plant–pollinator interactions is difficult in part because of the temporal and spatial dimensions of the abiotic changes and biotic responses. This may necessitate multiple approaches ranging from use of herbarium specimens to experimental transplant studies. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Byers (2017)</xref> reviews the diversity of current approaches assessing phenological changes in particular species to plant–pollinator networks. In this broad review, she discusses the advantages and limitations of the available approaches, as well as research needs in some understudied areas.
