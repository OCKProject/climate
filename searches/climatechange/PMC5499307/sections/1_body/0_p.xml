<p class="p">Plant–pollinator interactions are not only essential for successful reproduction of many native plant species (
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vanbergen and Insect Pollinators Initiative, 2013</xref>), they are also fundamental to the resilience of many ecosystems in which plant communities are connected by their pollinators (
