<p class="p">Climate change is likely to have significant and unpredictable impacts on the dynamics of most natural systems, which will translate into unique challenges for assessment and predictions of future interactions in an altered environment (

There are several reasons why it is particularly complex to assess the effects of climate change on plantâ€“pollinator interactions. First, changes in abiotic factors caused by climate change may not affect both plants and pollinators. For example, increased carbon dioxide, one of the main causes for climate change, can delay flowering (
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ward et al., 2012</xref>), but does not, to our knowledge, directly impact phenology of pollinators. In alpine habitats, flowering phenology is associated with snowmelt, while bee emergence is associated with temperature (

Second, even when both plants and pollinators do respond to the same type of environmental cues, how the plant and pollinator assess the cue may differ. For example, plants typically respond to a longer mean seasonal temperature as a cue for flowering, while pollinators use a shorter interval of temperature for emerging (
