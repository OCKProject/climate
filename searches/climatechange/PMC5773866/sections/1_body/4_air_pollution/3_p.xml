<p id="Par14" class="p">Social deprivation and age pre-dispose people for cardiovascular illnesses, which in turn compounds the effects of elevated O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM concentrations on their health. In 2008, the most deprived quintile in the UK experienced 50% higher cardiovascular disease mortality than the least deprived quintile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Women in routine jobs experience five times higher cardiovascular disease mortality than women in managerial and professional jobs. These differences in cardiovascular mortality risk and sensitivity to O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and PM pollution emerge from differences in the levels of deprivation, lifestyles, health literacy, access to health services, and environmental exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Social deprivation and ethnicity can also constrain adaptive capacity by limiting ability to relocate and to take other measures to avoid exposure or to reduce sensitivity.
