<p id="Par10" class="p">Fuel poverty and poor housing elevate exposure to cold-related deaths [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Older people often suffer from both and can thus be more exposed than other groups. Fuel poverty has also a gender dimension: women form over two thirds of pensioner population and of economically inactive single person households that are particularly likely to suffer from fuel poverty [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Those living in council housing may be less exposed than those living in their own property or renting privately, as income limitations may prevent older people from improving thermal comfort of their home. They are also more sensitive to cold because they cannot thermo-regulate their bodies as well as other age groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Sensitivity to cold is increased by pre-existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, which are more prevalent in older age groups. Limited economic and informational resources in turn may weaken the adaptive capacity of older people.
