<p id="Par25" class="p">The risk of flooding and its adverse health impacts are unevenly distributed in several ways. Those living in affordable housing and socio-economically disadvantaged households are over-represented in areas at risk from coastal flooding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. While these households are also exposed to riverine flooding, affluent households are particularly exposed to riverine flooding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Second, people with disabilities, chronic illness, young children or dependent on public transport can be more sensitive to flood risk. There is also evidence of gender differences in health outcomes related to exposure to flooding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Finally, the capacity of some groups to adapt or recover can be lower because of low incomes, lack of insurance or other reasons: uninsured losses to assets cannot be recovered and repeated exposure to flooding can deplete vulnerable households’ assets, adversely affect their health and make them more vulnerable in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. People’s tenure status and type of dwelling may also influence the outcomes they experience.
