 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Figures for the number of people exposed to flooding in the UK range from 1.5 million to 5 million [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Damage caused by flooding to buildings and contents of residential and non-residential properties amounts to about £1.3 billion per annum on average and in years of severe flooding such as 2007 losses can double. The above figures exclude loss of income due to disturbance caused by flooding and additional expenses to make alternative arrangements for leisure, work or business. These indirect losses can add 25–50% to direct losses to buildings and contents [
