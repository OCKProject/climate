<p id="Par4" class="p">While health and social inequalities have often been examined in the literature on health care and medicine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>], and social justice analysis has formed an established strand of climate change adaptation literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>], the intersection between these two areas of research has received less attention to date (but see [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]). It does merit further attention, however, because the incidence of the impacts of climate change on health is not equal, and because pre-existing social and health inequalities shape the outcomes that people will experience in changing climate. This article contributes to addressing this gap in the literature.
