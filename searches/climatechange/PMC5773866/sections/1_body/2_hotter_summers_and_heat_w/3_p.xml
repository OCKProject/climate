<p id="Par8" class="p">Older people are more sensitive to heat because of their weaker ability to thermo-regulate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>], and because they have other medical conditions. They are also more likely to have prescribed medication, some of which is associated with increased risk for heat related death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Their adaptive capacity may be limited by isolation or lack of information, mobility or autonomy. Lack of autonomy, and lack of care staff awareness and preparedness, may for example prevent or obstruct behavioural and other adaptations in residential or nursing homes [
