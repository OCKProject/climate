<p id="Par6" class="p">Climate change is expected to increase annual mean temperature by 2–5°C and increase the frequency and intensity of heat waves in the UK by 2100. Research has established a link between increased mortality and increased temperature and heat waves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Heat related excess deaths occur primarily as a result of respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. In England and Wales, mortality increases 2.1% for each 1°C increase in temperature above the 93rd percentile of average yearly temperature. The excess deaths caused by increased temperature can include substantial mortality displacement or “harvesting”, while it plays smaller role in mortality due to heat waves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Heat related mortality is projected to increase in the UK by 45% by 2020s and by 167% by 2050s when accounting for projected population growth and demographic change [
