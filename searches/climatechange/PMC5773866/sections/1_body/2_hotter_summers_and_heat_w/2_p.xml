<p id="Par7" class="p">Exposure to heat is greater in the South and East of the country, and people living in urban settlements are more exposed than those living in rural areas due to the urban heat island (UHI) effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Densely built neighbourhoods with limited open space and green areas increase people’s exposure to heat, but the geometry of the buildings and how they are built also influence exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Top floor flats experience greater thermal stress than ground floor flats. Ventilation has substantial influence on heat exposure – it may be constrained by physical building design or by considerations for crime, safety, noise and air pollution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Many of these factors leading to greater exposure come together in deprived urban neighbourhoods.
