<p id="Par19" class="p">Climate change will affect future health outcomes directly through extreme weather events such as heat waves, cold spells, and flooding impacting on the built infrastructure and social and institutional systems of health care provision, and indirectly due to induced changes in the volume and structure of demand for health care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Heat waves and cold spells can put systems of health care under pressure because of the mortality and morbidity increase for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and associated increases in hospitalisations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. Floods in turn result in increased accidents and emergency visits. Climatic extremes can increase ambulance call out rates by 25â€“35%, which is comparable to increases related to major flu epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. They also increase mental health problems and demand for services addressing them, and influence the length of time that support addressing them is needed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Direct impacts of extreme weather on health care systems include heat stress on inpatients and adverse health outcomes associated with heat stress discussed above, potential care and service disruptions because of power outages, delays in emergency responses and reduced access to health care because of the impacts of flooding and extreme weather on transport infrastructure and services, and reduced staffing and capacity for the same reasons in health care provision [
