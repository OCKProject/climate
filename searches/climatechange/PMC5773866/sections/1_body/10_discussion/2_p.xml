The number of people who are over 60 years old will increase by 50% by 2035 compared to 2010 [

At the same time, the systems of health care depend on critical infrastructure for the supply of electricity and water and for communication – this critical infrastructure is exposed and sensitive to the impacts of climate change, which can undermine care [
