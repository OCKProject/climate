 </sup> in this journal raises a number of observations about the politics of global health and how priorities and needs are framed. Here I expand upon two points from his article, and raise questions for the community of academics, policy-makers, practitioners and technocrats who work in the loosely defined sector of ‘global health.’ The first point relates to the question of whether we should be satisfied with global poverty reduction trends; the second to the threats posed by global warming and ecological degradation.
