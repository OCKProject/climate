<p class="p"> Finally, a more critical global health community would recognise the need to achieve global outcomes through local action. New economic models and re-democratisation, for example, are vital ingredients to the systemic change that is required â€“ but these ingredients will only be provided in sufficient quantity if communities, municipalities and other local groupings are actively engaged in their generation. Adequate systemic change, enabled by policy and legislation, will only occur if shaped and driven by demands from the ground. At the same time, systemic change can be catalysed by smaller-scale changes and developments involving communities at the local level. The large number of health professionals and workers who operate at the local level should be central to these endeavours, and those of us working in global health should look to enable our local health counterparts to create progressive change from the bottom up. </p>
