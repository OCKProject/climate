<p class="p"> There may be several reasons for this apparent paradox between what we know and what we do. It may be that the scale of danger posed by climate change is under-appreciated, enabled in part by vast amounts of manufactured disinformation that has been generated by the fossil fuel industry and climate denialists. Similarly, it may represent a cognitive-behavioural dissonance that results from an effective and ubiquitous advertising industry that drives a demand for unsustainable material consumption. It may also be that we feel a degree of entitlement from our work to improve the health of the global poor that excuses us from changing our lifestyles. Or we may hope that technological solutions will save us from having to change the way we live. Or we may simply lack hope in the ability of humanity to avoid self-destruction. </p>
