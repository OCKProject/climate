<p class="p">The growth-climate responses obtained for the full 1935â€“2011 period highlight the diversity in climate sensitivity of junipers across different elevations and regions (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0153888.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). Only junipers in southwest KG showed a distinct precipitation response at lower elevations (Khaidarkan and Krygyz Ata until ~2500 m asl; Karakuldja until ~2000 m asl) and a temperature response at higher altitudes towards the end of the growing season (
