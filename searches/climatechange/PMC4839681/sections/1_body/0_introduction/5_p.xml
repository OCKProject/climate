<p class="p">This study aimed to evaluate the climatic signal of juniper along altitudinal gradients in and across eight regions from eastern UZ to eastern KG. We investigated spatial trends and patterns in recent juniper growth using a new and extensive tree-ring width (TRW) network of 33 sites from the northern Pamir-Alay and Tien Shan mountain ranges in UZ and KG. We compared averages of climate, annual TRW increments, and tree growth-climate responses, as a function of elevation, between 1935–1964 and 1982–2011, and mapped differences across the entire study region. Results were discussed in the light of observed changes in climate, tree growth and climate sensitivity in Central Asia and similar regions.</p>
