<p class="p">Although changes in climate during the past eight decades were remarkable and comparatively rapid, trends in juniper growth are less obvious and uniform. Combining the obtained results, we can summarize that juniper trees at the sites in Karakol, KG, with humid growing season climate (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0153888.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) seem to have benefited from drier summers and consequently, showed increasing growth rates. Conversely, the drier and warmer sites in our study region (i.e. Zaamin, UZ, or Naryn, KG) showed no increases, or slight declines, in annual increments over the analyzed period. Our results, although not being very distinct, are in agreement with general trends observed for semi-arid environments in Asia and Europe. Liu

 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>], reviewing 66 dendrochronological studies including different broadleaf and coniferous species from more than 640 sites, detected an overall tendency of positive (negative) growth trends at temperate (xeric) sites across the Mediterranean Basin since the 1970’s. Differences in juniper growth at different sites can be linked to different physiological responses regarding gas exchange and water use. Increasing atmospheric CO

Moreover, changes in climate responses during winter and spring may additionally modify annual growth as has previously been reported for spruce at tree-line sites in Alaska, where warmer July temperatures lead to a decline in growth and warmer springs enhanced growth [
