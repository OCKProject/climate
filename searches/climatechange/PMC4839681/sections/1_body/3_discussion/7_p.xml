<p class="p">Over the full 1935–2011 period, the growth-climate relationships of the juniper sites generally showed benefiting effects on tree growth from warm temperatures at high altitudes and abundant moisture supply at low elevation sites (

The most likely cause for the relatively low number of statistically significant correlations between juniper growth (i.e. TRW) from high elevations and temperature are temporal instabilities in the climate signal, as indicated by our results. We found distinct response shifts where junipers from high elevation sites were becoming increasingly drought stressed during the past 30 years (
