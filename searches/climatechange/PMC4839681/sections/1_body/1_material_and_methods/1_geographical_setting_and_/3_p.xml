 <italic class="italic">Juniperus</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>.; locally called ‘Archa’) is the dominant taxa at mid- to high altitudes (1200–3500 m asl). Following altitudinal zones from low to high, three main subspecies,

 <italic class="italic">seravschanica</italic> Kom. (JUSE),

 <italic class="italic">semiglobosa</italic> Regel (JUSM), and 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">turkistanica</italic> Kom. (JUTU), form open forests with trees up to 8–10 meters in height on shallow soils, i.e. lithic leptosols (FAO classification; [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]). While juniper forests are highly abundant in eastern UZ and western KG, they are successively replaced by spruce (
 <italic class="italic">Picea</italic> sp.) in central KG and eastwards. At its eastern distribution limit in KG, only fragmented patches of juniper occur, where the trees often develop prostate stem forms.
