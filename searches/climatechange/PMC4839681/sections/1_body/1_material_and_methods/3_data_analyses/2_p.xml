<p class="p">To examine spatial and temporal changes in winter and summer climate, annual tree growth, and climate-growth responses to summer temperature and precipitation, the period differences were entered as point data in ArcMAP 10.1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Areas with no data coverage were estimated by an inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation technique [
 <xref rid="pone.0153888.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. This method fills missing cell values using a distance-weighted average of neighboring points. The power parameter 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> defines the influence of the weights. We used twelve neighboring points and 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 2, to give higher weights to closer points and progressively decreasing weights to distant points.
