<p class="p">We find widespread reductions in attainable yields of major cereals across a large fraction of current cropland by ca. 2050, but find that the total global land area climatically suitable for these crops remains largely unchanged, suggesting that in the absence of substantial advances in technology, it will be necessary to rethink crop choice and land-use patterns to achieve substantial production growth rates in the future. Our results not only improve confidence in the projections of vulnerability of the yields of cereal crops to climate change, but also point towards needs for knowledge on new technologies, and changes in management and genotypes.</p>
