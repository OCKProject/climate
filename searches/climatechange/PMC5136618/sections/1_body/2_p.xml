<p class="p">This uncertainty impedes understanding the scope of the societal challenge of climate change impacts on agriculture, particularly in developing countries where agriculture has larger shares in gross domestic product. Furthermore, large uncertainties in yield projections hinder our ability to assess the potential of various climate-change adaptation versus mitigation options; future changes in the productivity of different cropland areas will affect future land use, including societal decision-making on whether to, for example, reforest or intensify an area of cropland, or to extend cropland coverage
