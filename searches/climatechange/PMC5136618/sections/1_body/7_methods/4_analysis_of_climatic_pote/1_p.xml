<p class="p">In considering areas of potential cropland expansion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 2</xref>), areas with soil fundamentally unsuitable for cropping were masked out based on the GAEZ v3.0 database
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>: we combined soil suitability indices at a resolution of 10 arc minutes for excess salts, oxygen availability, rooting conditions, toxicities and workability, and excluded any areas that were not marked as minimal or moderate constraints in any of the five indices. Conditions relating to nutrients were neglected, as it is considered that fertilization would be required to achieve attainable yields in any case. To mask out areas with very low rainfall drawing analogues with regions with substantial fossil groundwater or non-local irrigation water sources (that is, water sources independent of grid-cell annual mean precipitation), we calculated the 5th percentile of the distribution of reference period annual mean precipitation across the current rainfed area of each crop
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. We then excluded from the cropland expansion analysis all grid-cells with annual mean precipitation below this level.
