<p class="p">Present-day maximum-attainable yields used in this analysis are obtained from the data set created by Mueller

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. Mueller 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. divided harvested area of each crop into 100 equal-area bins based on GDD and annual precipitation. They then calculated the attainable yield as the 95th percentile of yields within each climate bin, after exclusion of outliers. As such, attainable yields represent a maximum level consistently achievable in a climatic zone, given current technology, and not physiological potential yields.
