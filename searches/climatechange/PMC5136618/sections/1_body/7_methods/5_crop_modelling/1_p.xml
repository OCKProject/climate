<p class="p">Comparisons against Global Gridded Crop Models (GGCMs) used data from 6 GGCMs (LPJ-GUESS, LPJmL, pDSSAT, PEGASUS, EPIC, GEPIC)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. These GGCMs were run with the same climate data used for the 
 <italic class="italic">SED</italic> calculations herein for the period 1971–2099, and simulated maize, wheat and rice at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution for all land grid-cells (no rice simulations from PEGASUS). GGCM set-ups were not harmonized except for climate and [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>]. Simulations were made both with transient [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>], and with [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] fixed to 369 ppmv from year 2000 onwards. Here we compare our climate-analogue-derived attainable yields with modelled yields under full irrigation.
