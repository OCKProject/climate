<p class="p">Assessments of future food production under climate change have to-date relied on synthesis of crop-climate assessments at field and/or regional scales using models which vary from highly process-based to relatively empirical in formulation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. Both approaches can give important insights, but suffer also from significant limitations. Empirical models implicitly capture the effects of all relevant processes over the period and location for which they were parameterized, but they are often poorly tested for the conditions likely to become the future norm under climate change

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, and are typically limited in their spatial coverage. Process-based models account explicitly for physiological mechanisms, and can thus capture emergent behaviour under novel conditions, but generally suffer from missing processes, such as heat stress and the coupling of transpiration to leaf temperature

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Many research groups now develop and operate global-scale crop-climate models, but the necessary data for model development, parameterization and evaluation is often not available at this scale
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, and in most cases, global-scale assessments fail to account for farmer adaptation to climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. As a result, these models vary strongly in both the magnitude and overall direction of their yield projections, an effect which is especially pronounced across the tropics and arid regions
