<p class="p">A feature of the analogue method is that it identifies present day regions whose agricultural practices and crop varieties may hold lessons for other regions in the future, and thus where efforts should be made to maximize technology and knowledge transfer, that is, transferring existing crop varieties from the analogue to the target location, although we do not imply that the analogue approach can be used to derive explicit technology transfer pathways. It is not feasible to catalogue all potentially important analogue locations in a global analysis. However, we show some examples in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 14</xref>, and summarize the general situation using the mean latitudinal distance from which analogues are drawn (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 4</xref>). Mid-century analogues for cropland poleward of the 30th parallels are drawn, in the mean, from regions 18°, 13° and 22° latitude closer to the equator for maize, wheat and rice, respectively, and change relatively little between mid- and end-of-century, as analogues have already largely reached the extent of current harvested area of the crop in question by mid-century.
