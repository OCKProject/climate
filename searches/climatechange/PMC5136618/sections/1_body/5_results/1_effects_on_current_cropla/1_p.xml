<p class="p">By mid-century, following a strong climate change scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP, 8.5; Methods section) we find that most current wheat, maize and rice areas are within climatic conditions under which these crops are also cultivated today (

Analogues in the tropics, however, deteriorate greatly by end-of-century, especially for rice, as climates begin to emerge which are inconsistent with present-day cultivation of these crops. The results are qualitatively similar to results for previous assessments in which climate analogues were applied to investigate changes in biodiversity and natural vegetation, and which also showed poor present-day analogues for end-of-century climates in the tropics with strong climate change
