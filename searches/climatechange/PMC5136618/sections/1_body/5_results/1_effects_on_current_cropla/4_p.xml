<p class="p">The effect of these changes in attainable yield on efforts to intensify cereal production will be particularly marked; there will be a greatly reduced capacity to intensify crop production beyond current levels through efforts to close the yield gap on existing croplands. It has been estimated that closing yield gaps in current climates could increase global production of maize, wheat and rice by 67, 100 and 52%, respectively, on their current harvested areas
