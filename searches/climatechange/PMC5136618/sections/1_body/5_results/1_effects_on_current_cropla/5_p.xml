<p class="p">Although climate change stands to reduce production potential in many parts of the world, it nevertheless brings new opportunities in some regions. We identify large areas of current croplands where attainable yields increase substantially under climate change, with enhancements often exceeding 50% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). These areas are most prominent for wheat in the northern mid-latitudes, and include the large concentration of cropland in the central Canadian wheat belt, as well as western and central Russia. Assuming yield depressions from mismanagement, pests, diseases and other stresses are no higher in the target region than in the analogue region, this implies substantial increases in actual yields across these regions as a result of climate change.
