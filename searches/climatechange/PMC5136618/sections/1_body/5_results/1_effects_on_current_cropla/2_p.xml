<p class="p">We find that large areas of current cropland are projected to experience strong reductions in attainable yields of major cereal crops over the next century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>), indicating persistent vulnerability to climate change in the absence of significant advances in agricultural technology beyond that currently available. Our results are robust to the choice of GCM used to simulate climate, with agreement on the sign of yield change for at least four out of five GCM climates for the dominant spatial features in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 2â€“7</xref>). Reductions are particularly seen in the number of grid-cells within the current harvested area that are projected to have a high attainable yield for maize and wheat (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c,f</xref>). Vulnerable areas, which we define here as those showing a reduction in attainable yield &gt;10% relative to the present-day reference data set
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> and those which have no present-day analogue, vary by crop, but include some of the major regions of global food production (see below). Based only on areas where our results agree for at least four out of five GCM climates, our results indicate that already by mid-century 43, 28 and 40% of current global harvested area
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref> for wheat, maize and rice, respectively, is located in regions in which yields are vulnerable to climate change. In these regions, attainable yields are projected to either decline in the new climate, or no present-day analogue for the expected future climate can be found (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Vulnerable areas are not just located in low-producing regions; crops grown on areas designated as vulnerable by mid-century correspond to 43, 33 and 37% of the current global production of maize, wheat and rice respectively, increasing to ca. 74, 56 and 65% by end-of-century. If we consider all vulnerable areas indicated by at least one GCM climate, the vast majority of wheat, maize and rice production would be located in vulnerable areas by mid-century (
