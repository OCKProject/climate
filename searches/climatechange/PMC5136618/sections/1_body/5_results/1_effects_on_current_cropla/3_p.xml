<p class="p">The spatial consequences of these changes in attainable yield for agricultural production can be appreciated by considering the effect on yields of the dominant crop at each location. Reductions in attainable yield of the dominant crop (by area) of &gt;10% are projected across much of the eastern United States, Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa and temperate South America, and much of Eastern-Asia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). With the exception of regions with very strong management limitations, reductions in attainable yields are expected to generally imply reduction in actual yields unless measures can be taken to compensate by closing yield gaps (defined here as the difference between actual and maximum-attainable yields, given current technology). Highly developed countries, where yield gaps are already very small
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>, may thus face difficulties in sustaining current production without new technological interventions to increase attainable yield (for example, breeding novel crop cultivars). Such interventions could prove particularly challenging for maize and rice for which there has been little or no change in the genetic yield potential over recent decades
