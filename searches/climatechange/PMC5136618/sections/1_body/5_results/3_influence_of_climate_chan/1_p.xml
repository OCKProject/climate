<p class="p">Although we base our results on a strong climate-warming scenario (RCP 8.5), large changes in attainable yield are apparent already by mid-century, when warming projections between RCPs have not yet strongly diverged

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 11</xref>). In fact, estimated mid-century impacts on attainable yield, both positive and negative, are much stronger than most of the projections of actual yield synthesized in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. This reflects the fact that when climate is the main limiting factor for yields, then changes in climate will have a greater effect, and implies that greater intensification likely brings greater vulnerability of yields to climate change. This is in line with previous findings that weather variability often is the main driver of yield variability in highly productive areas, but not necessarily in areas of low productivity
