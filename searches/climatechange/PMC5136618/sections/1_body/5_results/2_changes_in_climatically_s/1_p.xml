<p class="p">Climate change can also increase the production potential of crops to levels of economic significance in regions which have hitherto been essentially uncropped. By expanding our analysis beyond the current harvested area of crops, we show that a large belt of land at high northern latitudes develops climates which are suitable for the production of wheat or maize with attainable yields by mid-century that are at least equivalent to the median attainable yield for that crop across current harvested area (

 <sup class="sup">9</sup> to 1.7 × 10
 <sup class="sup">9</sup> ha for wheat (

Notably, the area of land climatically suitable for rice expands strongly to mid-century in the extratropics, but decreases in the tropics. Under RCP 8.5, the size of climatically high-yielding areas in the tropics collapses by end-of-century for all three crops, highlighting the importance of avoiding such a strong climate-change scenario. The nature of these results is qualitatively consistent with simple suitability indices based upon GDD alone, and with results from global crop models (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref> (Methods section), we caution that because of its global scale it does not take account of local variations in soils or terrain properties which might adversely affect yields (although it is worth noting that poor soils can be remediated
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>). It also says nothing of whether it is economically viable to put in place the measures to achieve such yields in these locations. Ultimately, climatic suitability must be qualified by considering local-scale drivers.
