 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref> are very similar to those reported for actual yields in previous assessments
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>, with the exception of the positive changes in West Africa and India at mid-century, which we discuss further below. We further compare the changes in attainable yield produced by our data-driven method, with those of an ensemble of gridded global crop models recently used to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields as part of the ISI-MIP project

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figs 12 and 13</xref>). The simulations we compare against here are conceptually similar to the climate analogue approach in that they use fixed atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> mixing ratios [CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>] from 2000 onwards, however they differ in the fact that most models use fixed present-day fertiliser levels rather than unlimited nutrients, and in that the simulations allow unlimited irrigation, which may not be possible in some low-rainfall areas. Although the model-based climate-impact ensemble projections have a broad spread, the qualitative pattern of yield changes is very similar to the analogue method, with yield losses generally in the tropics and arid areas and increases in high latitudes. Notable differences between the model ensemble and climate analogue method arise for maize and rice in India and tropical West Africa. Here the models tend to show yield decreases, whilst the analogue approach suggests increases, however, we have lower confidence in yield projections in these locations as they show sensitivity to the analogue variable choice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Note 2</xref>). The models are also much more pessimistic regarding changes in wheat yields in the mid-latitudes, and especially across central-Asia. These more pessimistic projections from the models may result from limited or absent consideration of climate adaptation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. In reality, farmers will change their preferred cultivars, growing seasons and other management actions, as climate evolves. The analogue method implicitly accounts for cultivar adaptation within the bounds of the pool of globally-used cultivars, and for changes in growing seasons and other managements, possibly leading to positive changes in attainable yield in some regions where strongly negative effects have previously been expected. As there are many differences in methodology between the crop models and our analogue method, it is not possible to definitively attribute these different regional responses to adaptation. However, the comparison nonetheless demonstrates that inclusion of adaptation within the bounds of current technology does not fundamentally alter the global picture of yield change over the 21st century.
