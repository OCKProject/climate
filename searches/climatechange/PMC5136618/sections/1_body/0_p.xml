<p class="p">Between 1960 and 2000, global cereal production doubled, primarily through intensification of agriculture on current croplands and by the breeding of more productive crop varieties
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. It is projected that global food production needs to increase by another 60â€“110% by 2050, to keep up with anticipated increases in human population and changes in diet
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. Increases of this magnitude are possible through aggressive intensification in areas that are currently far below their potential
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. However, several challenges exist relating to our ability to overcome economic, societal and environmental impediments to intensification
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. To address these challenges effectively, and with a long-term outlook, it is necessary to understand how climate change is likely to impact the agricultural sector. Current expectations are that changes in climate over the next century will tend to decrease yields at lower latitudes and increase yields at northern latitudes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>, but no consensus exists on the magnitude, timing and exact location of these changes.
