<p class="p">We contend that early investment in regions that are likely to be climate analogues in the future could serve a dual benefit, both helping to alleviate any deficiencies in food production in these regions today, whilst also serving to inform, and thereby speed-up, climate adaptation in other locations in the future. This is particularly important when complications to the simple â€˜transfer' perspective arise where for instance tropical analogues are found for temperate grid-cells, and differences in, for example, day-length requirements may require identification and transferal of adapted germplasm, a process with potentially long lead-times

However, while the climate analogue approach could be a (biophysically based) tool to assess technology transfer, the specific boundaries of such an analogue framework would need to be evaluated with observations of cross-location performance of crop and soil management technologies before it could be operationally applied in this context.
