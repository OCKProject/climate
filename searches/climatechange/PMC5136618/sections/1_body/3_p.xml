 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>, to assess the vulnerability of yields of the three major global cereal crops, wheat, maize and rice to climate change. Using future climate projections from five General Circulation Models (GCMs) that contributed to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) as part of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, we identify present-day analogues of future climatic conditions, across the current global cropland area, with medium- (time window of 2041–2059, henceforth mid-century) and long-term (2081–2099, henceforth end-of-century) perspectives. Analogue climates are defined based on the accumulated annual sums of growing-degree-days (GDD) and precipitation, although we also test other variable combinations and seasonal averaging periods (Methods section). We make the assumptions that, given no changes in the global cultivar pool, the attainable yields of crops are purely a function of climate, and that the most effective yield-enhancing managements available are either spatially and temporally invariant, or also a function of climate; for instance, irrigation is unlikely to be widely available in very dry climates (neglecting possible finite fossil groundwater supplies or large rivers). Based on these premises, a yield which can be attained in the present day under a given climate can also be attained in the future, under an analogous climate, but at a different location. Areas with fundamentally unsuitable soils are avoided either by restricting projection of our results to current cropland area, or by masking with soil suitability information (Methods section). Our approach is thus independent of crop modelling methodologies typically used to project future yields, although, as for crop models, the results remain subject to uncertainties in terrain and soil type, particularly at the sub-grid scale. Further, it has important added value as, in addition to considering climatic effects on crop yields, it implicitly considers adaptation of management and crop type in line with current technology available for a given climatic environment. The technique allows us to (i) assess the change in attainable crop yield across the current global cropland area for each of maize, wheat and rice, (ii) identify areas where current dominant crops are likely to no longer be suitable in future, and (iii) to explore potential new growth locations for these crops.
