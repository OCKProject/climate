  <p class="p">Maps show percentage changes in attainable yield for for maize (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>), wheat (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) and rice (
   <bold class="bold">g</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">h</bold>). Areas where yields change by 10% or less are marked in magenta. Areas with no present-day climate analogue are marked in grey (very few grid-cells). Yield changes are only shown for grid-cells which have a present-day climate analogue within the current harvested area of each crop, and where the current area devoted to that crop within the grid-cell exceeds 1,000 ha (ref. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>). Panels 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">f</bold> and 
   <bold class="bold">i</bold> show how the distribution of attainable yields at the grid-cell level is projected to evolve between the reference period (magenta line) and end-of-century (red line). Loss of area under the probability density curves is equivalent to the number of grid-cells for which no valid climate analogue can be found. Present-day attainable yields are obtained from ref.
