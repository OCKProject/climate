  <title class="title">Yield vulnerability of dominant crop.</title>
  <p class="p">Maps show grid-cells where the dominant crop by area is projected to undergo reductions in attainable yield of at least 10% by 2041–2059 (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) and 2081–2099 (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) relative to the reference period. The dominant crop is indicated by colour, with darker shades indicating that the attainable yield is maintained or increased, and lighter shades indicating areas in which it undergoes a decrease &gt;10%. Only grid-cells where the sum of cropped area of wheat, maize and rice exceed 1,000 ha are shown
