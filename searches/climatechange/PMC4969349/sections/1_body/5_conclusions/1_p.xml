<p class="p">Overall, this study showed that, despite current governmental regulations for agricultural matters, climate change will affect traditional landscapes significantly. Wherever possible, farmers will intensify cropping, which will ultimately affect ecosystem services, tourism, and biodiversity. Increasing funding and premiums will only guide future developments of the farming sector if farmers value them as financially adequate (i.e., if they are very high). Current premiums, particularly the environmental premium (Ã–PUL), are too low to attract the majority of farmers, and will become even less attractive if climate change permits further yield increases. If premiums are to be adjusted in the future, it is necessary to consider the different decision strategies applied by the various farm segments and operational (farming) types. Without a regionally adapted strategy, the agricultural landscapes are likely to lose their attractive, diverse structure and their suitability for recreation and tourism. These trends may also affect biodiversity and may provoke a discussion about other conservation matters.</p>
