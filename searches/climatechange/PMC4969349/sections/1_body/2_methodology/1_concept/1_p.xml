<p class="p">As elaborated above and illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the study first analyzed possible effects of climate change in the selected test site. The second step of the analysis focused on possible agro-economic land use models and possible changes in the contribution margin for both new and traditional land use options. Based on these climate change scenarios and a literature review, various new farming opportunities, such as short-rotation forests, were identified as feasible alternatives. Several stakeholder meetings were arranged to obtain qualitative evaluations from farmers about farming opportunities under a new climate regime, and to test their reaction to environmental premiums or AES, both based on the current programs at the time and the budget plans for the EU funding period of 2014–2020. A typical AES requires farmers to modify farming practices in exchange for a per-hectare payment. The AES are perceived as suitable instruments for steering land use and safeguarding various societal interests. During the last EU funding period, around 6.8 billion € of the EU’s budget were needed to fund these schemes. This research was undertaken during the controversial discussions about new AES concepts for the period 2014–20, and therefore discusses different policy options for steering the overall development in the study region. The steps in light gray in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> served as the basis for the farmer questionnaire.
