<p class="p">The operationalization of the CE required a statistical design plan to create the hypothetical alternatives and their organization into choice sets. The study applies an orthogonal fractional factorial design plan of Resolution III (Raghavarao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2011</xref>) in a labeled CE (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This approach ensured that the main effect of each attribute was entirely uncorrelated with all other attributes within the same alternative and every attribute of the other two competing alternatives. The CE required the farmers to choose between three labeled alternatives: cash crop, short-rotation, and grassland cultivation. Each alternative was specified with five attributes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The entire design plan contained 48 choice sets, and one respondent evaluated six of these choice sets, which were randomly chosen. For the next respondent, another six randomly selected choice sets without replacement were drawn, until the pool of 48 sets was exhausted; thereafter, another round of choice set application started. Linear by linear interactions were estimable within each alternative separately and integrated in the analyses to explain additional coherences.
