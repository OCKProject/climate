<p class="p">As floods are possible in this area and as they are likely to increase further under conditions of climate change, a complete crop failure must be taken into consideration. Possible impacts by pondage water differ between the three cultivation alternatives. If the pondage exceeds a few days, short-rotation forests are hardly affected, while cash crop will be significantly damaged. Therefore, the likelihood of complete crop failure for cash crop was selected to occur every “2 years” or “3 years.” In short-rotation forests, a complete crop failure is likely to only occur every 10–25 years, and in areas with grassland every 5, 10 or 15 years.</p>
