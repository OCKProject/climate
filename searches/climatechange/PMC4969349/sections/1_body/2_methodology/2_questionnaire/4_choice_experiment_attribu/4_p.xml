<p class="p">Environmental premiums per ha per year (AES) differ between the three alternatives. Based on the funding schemes at the time, we increased the available funding and invented a nonexisting climate premium. The premium for cash crop cultivation is mainly paid for catch crops and reflects payments at the time. Currently, Austria does not offer a premium for short-rotation forests. Since wood chips have become increasingly popular as a heating system in many Austrian households in the countryside, a nonexisting climate premium was included to support heating based on renewable energy for this alternative. For grassland, typical payments, which are in most cases around 300 or 600 € per ha and year, were used. Two nonexisting payment levels (900 and 1200 €) were chosen to study opportunities and limits of AES against other land use options.</p>
