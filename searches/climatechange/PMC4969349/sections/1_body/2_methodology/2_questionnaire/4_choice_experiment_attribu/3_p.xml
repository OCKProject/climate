<p class="p">The gross margin per ha per year for cash crop cultivation was operationalized based on typical ranges in this area (300, 450, 750, and 1200 €) and an estimation of a potential increase under conditions of climate change, significantly higher than the current gross margins (1650 €). The range of levels for short-rotation forest was determined based on a market research on wood chips revenues across Austria. For grassland, the levels reflect the current range of gross margins in the region, also adjusted to possible effects of climate change.</p>
