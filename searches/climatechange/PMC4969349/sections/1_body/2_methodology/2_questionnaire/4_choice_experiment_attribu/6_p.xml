<p class="p">The influence of potential price fluctuations was intensively discussed with stakeholders, since international market prices are of increasing importance in this region. As crop-growing decisions are generally made during the spring, only general trends can be considered during this decision-making. Therefore, the alternative-specific levels only include broader statements of expected trends. The price fluctuations are highly significant for cash crop cultivation, relevant for short-rotation forests, and of little importance for grassland. Hence, levels vary between “low” for grassland and “very high” for cash crop cultivation (Table
