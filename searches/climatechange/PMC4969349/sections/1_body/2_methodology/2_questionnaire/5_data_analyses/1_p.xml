<p class="p">Data analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics Version 21 and Microsoft Excel 2011; the choice experiment was analyzed through Latent Gold 5.0. Investigation of the choice model for the whole sample produced reliable results, while a latent class analysis did not yield very insightful outcomes, as class formation generated highly unequally distributed classes with minor significant differences. However, an a priori segmentation by farm type did explain heterogeneity (performed as a ‘known class analysis’ in Latent Gold). The a priori segmentation was based on a principal component analysis with Varimax rotation and a hierarchical cluster analysis applying a Ward’s method clustering of farmers’ perceived future farm development, resulting in three distinct clusters. The computed conditional logit models produced separate, comparable models, in which estimates were compared across classes through Wald(=) statistics. Some estimates, for which the Wald(=) estimates were insignificant, were collapsed across the three segments. The results of the logit regression were then used to design a decision support tool (DST), a predictive tool in Excel. The interface of the DST was designed after the choice experiment, in which all levels of all attributes could be selected individually. The upper section of DST (Table

 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>) shows the land use management options, while the lower section gives an insight into the preferences of all farmers (“All farms”) and the three clusters (“Traditional farm,” “Dynamic large farm,” and “Farmer with perspective”). The next section describes all results in detail.
