<p class="p">In order to investigate perception of farmers and operations, we developed an online questionnaire. This questionnaire was designed as an online questionnaire, but programed to run on laptop computers without requiring access to the Internet. Stakeholders and other nonspecialists pretested the questionnaire to guarantee comprehensibility and ease of operation. Interviews were coordinated in cooperation with the chamber of agriculture and conducted in the March–Thaya floodplains between January and September 2012. The local chamber of farmers, a subassembly of the chamber of agriculture, an institution with mandatory membership for every farmer in Austria, recommended participation in the survey and organized six meetings in the study area where all local farmers were able to fill in the questionnaire. To avoid any sampling bias, farmers who did not participate in the organized meetings were visited on their farms and were asked to complete the survey at home. The cooperation with the chamber increased the response rate significantly. Participating farmers owned approximately 34 % of the entire study area.</p>
