<p class="p">This research focuses on these diverse grassland ecosystems with a high relevance for ecosystem services in the region (e.g., biodiversity, soil protection, water retention, recreation) and a well-adapted, extensive land use, significantly supported by AES. Under conditions of climate change, these wetlands will allow farmers to successfully apply alternative land use options and are likely to be changed over time.</p>
