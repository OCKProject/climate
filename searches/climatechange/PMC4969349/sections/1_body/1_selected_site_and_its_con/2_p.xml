<p class="p">Current meteorological research shows that the global near-surface temperature in Central Europe is expected to follow the past trends of warming. This general warming can be observed by comparing the average near-surface temperature of 1961–1990 with the prognosis for the period of 2021–2050. The overall annual mean temperature in Europe will rise by up to approximately 2 °C by 2050 and 3.5 °C (more than 4.5 °C in the northern regions) by 2100. A temperature increase of up to 4 °C is likely to be expected during the summer months in Southern Europe, as well as the southern parts of Austria by the end of the century (van der Linden and Mitchell

By the end of the century, annual precipitation in Southern Europe and the Iberian Peninsula will gradually decrease. At the same time, precipitation in the northern parts, particularly in Scandinavia and Russia, will significantly increase (van der Linden and Mitchell
