<p class="p">The test site covers 45,200 ha and 13 small municipalities. About 75 % of the area is intensively used as agricultural land. Here, crop rotation is dominated by winter wheat, spring barley, and sugar beets. Furthermore, the production of corn has increased significantly in recent years. The remaining 25 % of the area is of high nature conservation value (designated as Ramsar and Natura 2000 sites under the EU Habitats and Birds directives), containing cultivated and noncultivated zones. Typical for this part of Austria are relatively large farms with an average size of 60 ha (up to 500 ha). The majority of farms only have a small portion of their land located within the Ramsar area, which has been mainly used as permanent grassland in the past.</p>
