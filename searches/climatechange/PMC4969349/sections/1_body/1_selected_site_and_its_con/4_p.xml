<p class="p">The temperature increase of 2 °C by 2050 will most likely lead to significant changes of land use in the March–Thaya floodplains. Temperature-induced yield reductions will probably be compensated by the CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">2010</xref>). Summer drought will reduce yield stability, especially in the nonirrigated regions of the test site (Eitzinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2009</xref>). The length of the growing season will clearly increase by 12 days (2025 low climate sensitivity scenario) to 32 days (2050 high climate sensitivity scenario) (Eitzinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). By 2050, the growing season for permanent crops will, on average, start 14 days earlier. Yield of winter grain will benefit from this development while summer grain yields will decrease. Also, higher spatial differences in yield will occur in association with site-specific soils’ water storage capacity (Gerersdorfer and Eitzinger 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>; Eitzinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2008</xref>). Overall, yield will in fact increase, yet volatility of these yields will also increase due to more extreme weather conditions. Generally, climate change may not necessarily have a negative impact on agricultural production within the study region (Formayer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2007</xref>; Gandorfer and Kersebaum 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2009</xref>). It is projected that a change of the underlying conditions can easily be compensated through an adjustment of plant cultivation and management strategies, and the already existing or expanded irrigation technology (Wirth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2013</xref>).
