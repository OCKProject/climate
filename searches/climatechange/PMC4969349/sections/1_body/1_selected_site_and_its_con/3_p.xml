<p class="p">The climate in the test site is continental with hot, dry summers and cold winters with little snow. During the summer months, low humidity and minor dew formation are typical. The annual mean temperature for the period of 1971–2000 was 9.5 °C (ZAMG

In comparison to the period of 1971–2005, the annual temperature sum will increase from 2383 to 2582 °C in 2050. Moreover, the growing season is likely to be extended from 228 to 245 days, and the dormant season will therefore decrease from 137 to 120 days for the same period. The overall sum of temperatures is likely to increase by about 8 % over the next two decades (Eitzinger et al.
