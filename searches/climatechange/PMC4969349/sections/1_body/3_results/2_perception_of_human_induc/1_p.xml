<p class="p">Farmers were confronted with the following four statements regarding the occurrence of climate change and were asked to select the one statement closest to their own perception of climate change. Overall, the majority of farmers (64.2 %) already “recognize the first effects of human induced climate change,” while 7.5 % expect to see “significant effects in the near future.” Another 25 % are “undecided if climate change will occur,” and 2 % “do not believe in climate change.” These farmers who do not believe in climate change evaluate the climate change debate as scaremongering and point out that climatic changes go beyond the anthropological records. Nevertheless, when asked about the impact of climate change on agriculture in an open-ended question, 74.3 % of farmers expect effects on agriculture in the province of Lower Austria in the form of “weather extremes,” “more frequent flooding,” “increase of temperatures leading to hotter summers and winters,” “severe droughts,” “increasing fluctuations of temperatures,” “heat waves,” “a decrease in precipitation so that irrigation systems will be necessary,” “uneven distribution of precipitation,” “longer drought periods,” “more and new pests,” “changes in crop rotation,” “altered cultivation potentials,” and “changes in harvest times.”</p>
