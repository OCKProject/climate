<p class="p">The results of the conditional logit model for the entire sample (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>) show linear estimates for each attribute (separated by cultivation type). All estimates are based on linear coding (nominal coding by level revealed clear linear trends for each attribute). Interactions between the type of cultivation and environmental premium have also been included in the model. The intercepts for the model reveal that, under average baseline conditions, short rotation is much less preferred compared to the two other cultivation methods. The estimates of gross margins and environmental premiums (AES) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>) show clear trends and their acceptance increases with higher revenues and support. The preference for AES for grassland cultivation increases further if the premium increases above the current environmental premiums of about 300–600 €. As expected, if the rotation period for short-rotation forest increases to more than 15 years, it is perceived negatively. Possible price fluctuations influence the decision-making in favor of crash crops; much more so than the two other land use options. The likelihood of complete crop failure turned out to be highly significant for cash crop but much less so for short-rotation forests and grassland cultivation. Once the likelihood of a complete crop failure is reduced to every 10 years or more, concerns about failure diminished to an insignificant level.
