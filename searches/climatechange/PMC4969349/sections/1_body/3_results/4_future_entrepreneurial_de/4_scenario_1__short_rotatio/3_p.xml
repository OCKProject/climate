<p class="p">When introducing higher price fluctuations for cash crop, the attractiveness of short-rotation forest would increase further and the share of traditional farmers would increase to 82 % (56.42 % of all farms). If the environmental premium for grassland were to increase to 900 €, the likelihood of growing short-rotation forests would remain high, even though short-rotation forests do not fetch any premiums at the moment. The trends toward heating houses with renewable energy (i.e., wood chips) in rural areas and an already very intensive agricultural land use, could lead to such a premium for short-rotation forests. The sample reacted significantly to this (invented) new premium, especially the “dynamic, large farms” and the “farms with perspective.” The likelihood of a complete cash crop failure every 2 years was another argument in favor of this new land use option. A further effect of climate change can be shown if we assume faster growth of short-rotation forests and a decreased harvest period of 15 years. These changes increase the attractiveness of short-rotation cultivation by another 5–10 %, depending on the segment.</p>
