<p class="p">One new land use option, which will become more attractive under conditions of climate change, is the short-rotation forest, which currently requires a rotation period of 20–25 years, even in the excellent growing conditions of these flood plains. The agro-economic analyses showed that both increasing mechanization for this new land use and an increasing price for wood chips might make this form of land use more attractive in the future, especially if the rotation period shortens to 15 years.</p>
