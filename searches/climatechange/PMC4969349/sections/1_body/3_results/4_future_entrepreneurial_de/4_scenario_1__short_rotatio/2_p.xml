<p class="p">Scenario 1 in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> describes the conditions under which most respondents decided in favor of short-rotation forests. We assume a consistent contribution margin for cash crop and short-rotation forestry (around 750 €), while grassland enjoys an environmental premium that is as attractive as the other two options. In that scenario, farmers will take the flood risk of cash crop into account and, therefore, the majority would prefer short-rotation forests. The existing grassland, which is characterized by the same likelihood of complete crop failure (every 10 years) as short-rotation forests, will become significantly less attractive. Especially the traditional farmers will be very attracted to the short-rotation forests (78.62 %) (Table
