<p class="p">These results provide the background for a predictive model or decision support tool (DST), which shows the likely choices by the entire sample and its respective clusters for possible scenarios. Below, we will use the DST to investigate the likely choices of the respective segments with regard to the main research questions on possible new types of agricultural use under conditions of climate change, and the impact of incentives and possible structural policies (AES):
