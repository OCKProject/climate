 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> shows that, if all cultivation options provided high contribution margins and a very high AES was implemented to maintain the meadows, 42.96 % of farms would choose this option. A closer look at the three different segments reveals that it is more than half of the “dynamic large farms” (58.49 %) and the “farms with perspective” (51.93 %) that are interested in maintaining the meadows. In other words, even under the condition of extreme incentives, the main goal—to protect these meadows with a very high premium—would not be fully achievable. The traditional farmers were least interested, as only 13 % would continue grassland cultivation in the future. Modifying the risk of potential price fluctuations for cash crop changed the decision slightly in favor of grassland (by about 5 %) for the “dynamic large farm” and “farm with perspective,” but not for the “traditional farm.” Neither did the gross margin of grassland cultivation influence this decision. Only given a low contribution margin for short-rotation cultivation would grassland cultivation become more attractive. If its margin were only around 150 € per ha and year, 75 % of the dynamic large farms and 67 % of the farms with perspective would decide in favor of grassland cultivation. For the traditional farms, this option would remain less attractive (33 %), as the majority would still prefer cash crop cultivation (59 %).
