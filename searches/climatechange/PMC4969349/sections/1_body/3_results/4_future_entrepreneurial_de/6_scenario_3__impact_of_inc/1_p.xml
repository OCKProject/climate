<p class="p">Since the test site belongs to the European network of protected areas NATURA 2000, EU regulations intend that valuable wet meadows should not be deteriorated. A common mechanism toward this goal is the introduction of contractual measures. In Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref>, we simulated this conservation strategy by offering a very high environmental premium to maintain the extensive use of grassland on the flood plains. To do so, the simulation included an environmental premium of 1200 €, which effectively doubles the current premiums of 300–600 €; the exact amount depends on the specific character of the meadow and the management efforts required. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab7" ref-type="table" class="xref">7</xref> shows the farmers’ likely reactions to this high AES for grassland cultivation under the assumption that alternatives do not receive any incentives, that the likelihood of complete crop failure for cash crop is rather high (every 2 years), and that gross margins are high. For short-rotation cultivation in this scenario, we assume a high gross margin under average conditions (duration 20 years, failure every 10 years).
