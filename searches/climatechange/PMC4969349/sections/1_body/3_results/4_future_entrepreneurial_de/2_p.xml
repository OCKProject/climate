<p class="p">Despite clear trends in the overall model, the three farmer clusters defined above (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) showed very different preferences and intended behavior for the respective farming alternatives under various climatic conditions and incentive regimes. The three segments differed significantly in their preferences for the land use alternatives: Traditional farmers strongly prefer cash crops, and have a serious dislike for grasslands; dynamic large farms prefer grassland; farmers with perspective dislike short-rotation energy crops the most. The alternative-specific model, that also includes interactions, reveals many differences between segments (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>), which will become apparent more clearly in the scenarios presented below.
