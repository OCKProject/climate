 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref> describes the effects of a significant increase in the contribution margin of cash crop cultivation, which most agro-economic experts expect to occur due to climate change. To model this scenario, we assume excellent conditions for short-rotation and grassland cultivation, low price fluctuations, the current level of funding, and a moderate likelihood of complete crop failure. Now, the majority of all farmers would shift to cash crop cultivation. Such a shift implies, that even the small, ecologically valuable strips of meadows close to the floodplain would disappear in no time. The typical environmental premium, which is currently about 300 € per ha per year, will not be sufficient to stop this probable trend. Even the small amount of land considered in these CEs (we looked at 3 ha of land per farmer) would be changed under these conditions. Short-rotation cultivation would be chosen by about 22 % of the farmers, grassland cultivation by only about 12 %. Overall, traditional farmers showed the highest likelihood to shift from current grassland cultivation to cash crop.
