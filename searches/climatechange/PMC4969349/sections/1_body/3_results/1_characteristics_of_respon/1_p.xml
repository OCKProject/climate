<p class="p">The 148 surveyed famers cultivated a total of 11,227 ha of land with an average acreage of 76.3 ha. The majority of the respondents were between 36 and 55 years of age. Almost two-thirds of all participants over the age of 50 had already chosen a successor for their operation. The majority (81 %) farmed full-time, while 19 % were part-time farmers. Most farms were managed conventionally, but 13 % were organically certified. Over 95 % of farmers cultivated cash crops (full-time famers: 76.4 ha average size and 199 ha the largest operation; part-time farmers: 55.9 ha average size and 165 ha the largest operation). Other frequently cultivated crops included wine (29.1 %, average size 6.21 ha), hay meadow (single reaping; 23.0 %, average size 4.7 ha), and ley farming (11.5 %, average size 7.8 ha). Hay meadows with a triple reaping were the least common cultivation method. A comparison with the agro-economic analyses of the region showed that the respondents formed a representative sample for the selected test site (Statistik Austria
