<p class="p">From the principal component analysis, two components emerged with an Eigenvalue greater than one (Kaiser criterion) and factor loadings at an acceptable level above 0.56: the first component combined variables supporting a farm expansion (expansion, intensification, specialization, change to organic), while the other component included indicators of a declining farm operation (termination, reduction, change to conventional). The two components combined explained 65.6 % of variance of the entire sample. A hierarchical cluster analysis applying a Ward’s method to the components resulted in three distinct clusters: Cluster 1—Traditional farms (
