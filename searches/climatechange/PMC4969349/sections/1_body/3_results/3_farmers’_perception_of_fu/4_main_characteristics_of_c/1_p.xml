<p class="p">The small group “traditional farmers” is the most skeptical regarding climate change. This cluster is significantly older, less educated, and only includes one organically certified operation. Despite being the oldest group, only 40 % have a confirmed successor. The farmers “with perspective” own and operate about the same amount of land, but are significantly younger, better educated, and more interested in organic farming. Almost three quarters already stated a confirmed successor, although the percentage of part-time farmers is significantly higher than in the other two clusters. Farmers in this group are thought of as having perspective, as the majority is highly interested in expanding their operation through purchase or lease of land. A number of these farmers may be in transition to the “dynamic large farm” characterized by significantly larger land holdings. Farmers in the “dynamic large farm” cluster are the most educated, all of them have a confirmed successor, and they state the highest percentage of farms with organic cultivation. All “dynamic farmers” and “farmers with perspective” recognize climate change as a new challenge and already take its influence into consideration.</p>
