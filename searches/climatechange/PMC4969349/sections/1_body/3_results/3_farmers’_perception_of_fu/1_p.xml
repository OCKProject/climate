<p class="p">Farmers were asked how they perceived the likely development of their farm in the upcoming 5–10 years on a scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely), (Fig.

The majority of respondents planned to expand their farm, intensify farming or specialize in a particular crop; on the other hand, reducing the amount of acreage, changing to a different management model (i.e., conventional vs. organic farming), or terminating the business were the least likely options envisaged. No statistically significant differences emerged between full- and part-time farmers for this question.
