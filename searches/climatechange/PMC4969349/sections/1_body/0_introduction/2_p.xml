<p class="p">As we know from many studies, climate change will likely alter agro-economic use patterns, explicitly in Central Europe (Rogers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>; de Wit 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2006</xref>, Kromp-Kolb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2007</xref>), which challenges the current standard predictions for future agricultural land use. Two aspects need to be considered: Firstly, agricultural crop production is already changing because the underlying biophysical conditions of the agro-ecosystem resources and functions have already shifted during the past decades due to climate change (Assad et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2004</xref>; Perarnaud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">2005</xref>). Secondly, land use has been adapted in order to mitigate climate change, e.g., by the introduction of short-rotation forests (Paulrud and Laitila 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010</xref>; Shoyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2013</xref>).
