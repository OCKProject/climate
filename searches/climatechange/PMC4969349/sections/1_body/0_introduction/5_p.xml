<p class="p">Farmers need to be recognized as crucial decision makers when it comes to the implementation of agricultural climate change policies. Therefore, their decisions may not be in line with expert’s predictions and modeling of adaptation processes in land use, as multiple internal factors may play a major role. This study improves the understanding of farmers’ choices under the consideration of climate change, varying economic conditions, and different policy regimes. In order to discuss the likelihood of land use changes, we selected a study area in Austria mainly characterized by marginal land of high biodiversity and beauty, so changing climatic conditions will allow new land use options for these sites and may require the application of new policy instruments to maintain the current cultural landscape.</p>
