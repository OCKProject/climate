<p class="p">In recent years, several attempts have been made to assess the risk that future climate change effects pose for crop production and to search for suitable adaptation measures for agricultural systems in Central Europe (Eitzinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2009</xref>; Marracchi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2005</xref>). The climate change predictions in these models usually assumed future constraints on agricultural production triggered by a limited availability of water and/or increased temperature, while the potential for new types of agricultural production has received less attention (Soja and Pascual-Rodriguez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2010</xref>). Furthermore, at least in Austria, predictions on the potential influence of climate change are usually based on qualitative expert opinion only (Eitzinger et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2002</xref>), assuming that their perception of climate change and experience in decision-making are sufficient to represent the complex business decisions that farmers face. In contrast, Grothmann and Patt (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2005</xref>) note that research on climate change and land use often ignored farmers’ personal perception of adaptation opportunities and necessity (Grothmann and Patt 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2005</xref>: 44f). Recent agro-economic research has shown that, in addition to economic indicators (profitability, liquidity, and stability), noneconomic factors such as tradition, education, and social context matter significantly, as documented for AES (Morris

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2004</xref>; Ruto and Garrod 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2009</xref>), genetically modified crops (Breustedt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2008</xref>), biodiversity conservation (Pagiola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2004</xref>; Pröbstl and Zimmermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">2010</xref>), and climate change adaptation (Paulrud and Laitila 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2010</xref>). All of these studies identified significant heterogeneity among farmers. Further research, which investigated links between farmer adaptation to climate change and various elements of social, human, natural, physical, and financial capital, reported a strong influence of education level, experience of past conditions, strong community leadership, social norms regarding environmental action, economic viability of farm businesses, and farm size (de Wit

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2008</xref>; Milne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2008</xref>). In addition, Rogers et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>) highlight the complex nature of rural landholders’ decision-making in the context of climate change. Farmers are the crucial decision makers, who ultimately determine the production systems implemented and the visual appearance of these landscapes and do not necessarily strive to maximize income or economic return when faced with changing baseline conditions. Their decision may not be in line with scientific modeling of climate change and scientific predictions of adaptation processes in land use.
