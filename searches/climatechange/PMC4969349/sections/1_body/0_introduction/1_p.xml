<p class="p">Austria is characterized by a great diversity of cultural landscapes, which add value to the economy of many regions. These landscapes usually have multiple functions: in addition to agricultural production, they also offer a range of ecosystem services and provide the setting for recreational and touristic landscape experiences. Cultural landscapes and the many factors that influence their quality [e.g., location and policy, such as Agri-environmental schemes (AES)] have already been researched extensively (Primdahl et al.
