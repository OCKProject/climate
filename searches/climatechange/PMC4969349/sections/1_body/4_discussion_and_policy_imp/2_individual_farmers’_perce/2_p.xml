<p class="p">The only exception to farmers’ high awareness of climate change effects in Austria relates to risk behavior. Under conditions of climate change within the immediate range of the March–Thaya floodplains, the flood hazard is likely to increase. Therefore, climate change will lead to new land use options but also to new risks in this area. Farmers’ risk behavior in the choice experiment shows that more risk is taken if the expected contribution margin is very high (for example, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>.). Furthermore, participants with larger farms show a higher risk avoidance behavior than the smaller enterprises and traditional farms. Finally, the overall reaction to economic risks, such as changes of global market prices, is stronger than reactions to climate change phenomena, such as flooding.
