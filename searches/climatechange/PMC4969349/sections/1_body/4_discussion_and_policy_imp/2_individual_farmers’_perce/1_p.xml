<p class="p">The perception of human-induced climate change among farmers in this European region differs greatly from surveys in the US, where farmers frequently denied and disregarded climate change as an important driver of future conditions (Leigh et al.

In Austria, descriptions of experts and reported experiences of farmers are rather similar. A large majority of farmers believe in the currently proposed scenarios. They are fully aware of the situation and already invest in irrigation measures to compensate possible impacts. However, compared to respondents in the winter tourism and outdoor recreation industry in Austria (Landauer et al.
