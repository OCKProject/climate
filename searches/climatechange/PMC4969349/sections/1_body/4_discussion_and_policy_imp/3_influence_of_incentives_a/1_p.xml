<p class="p">The choice experiment clearly showed that the decisions by the majority of farmers in the March–Thaya floodplains are driven primarily by the opportunities to earn a higher contribution margin for cash crops. Traditional grassland and short-rotation cultivation, which would constitute a new and attractive land use option due to the extended growing season induced by climatic changes, will therefore continue to represent only a small proportion of overall land use in the future. Even an unrealistic increase of the environmental premium to 1200 € (ÖPUL WF premium) would sway less than half of all farmers to abandon intensive cropping. Interestingly, it was the category of the largest and most modern farms that considered environmental premiums more than the others. On the other hand, risks of the world market and high price fluctuations play a greater role in the decision-making of all farmers than the environmental premium.</p>
