<p class="p">Certainly, both approaches are helpful and necessary. However, why one should attempt to involve farmers directly, instead of modeling the likely future developments only, remains a crucial question in climate change research. When Sohl and Claggett (

However, decision makers and public policies focus on practical, transparent, and realistic information. This information should be provided in a flexible and realistic manner, adaptable to specific questions.
