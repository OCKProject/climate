<p class="p">Comparing expert-based (Kromp-Kolb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2007</xref>) models of climate change impacts on the land use in the test site with the findings of this study, similar overall trends are revealed: a high likelihood of increasing crop margins in the floodplains. The expert model includes specific adaptation measures, such as the potential influence of technical soil management on water consumption, while the possible role of short-rotation forestry is mentioned but not specified. The most crucial aspects, the likelihood of significant land use changes and the loss of remaining grassland, are not covered by the expert-based model at all.
