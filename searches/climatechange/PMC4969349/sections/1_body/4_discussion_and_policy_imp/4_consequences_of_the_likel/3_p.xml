<p class="p">The likely development described in the scenarios is that conditions will deteriorate for wild birds, which are already under pressure in the open landscape due to increased fertilization, use of biocides, and increasingly early reaping times (Stübing

The loss of a more diverse landscape and the bird watching opportunities in the March–Thaya floodplains will also affect the cultural services and related regional development options based on tourism. The results show that, based on a behavioral model of famers as decision makers, with the current and even significantly increased environmental premiums, the negative effects on different ecosystem services cannot be mitigated sufficiently to prevent major biodiversity losses.
