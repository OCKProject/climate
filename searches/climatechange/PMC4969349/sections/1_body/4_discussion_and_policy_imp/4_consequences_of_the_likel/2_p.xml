<p class="p">Climate change is perceived as a major threat to biodiversity in Central Europe. Current research describes an increasing loss of optimal habitats, significant impacts of fragmentation on habitats and the food web, and an increasing relevance of invasive species (Doyle and Ristow

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">2013</xref>). A further aggravation is also very likely to impact related ecosystem services. In the case of this study region, a significant loss of meadows must be expected, with significant effects on wild birds (Kelemen-Finan et al.
