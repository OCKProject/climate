<p class="p">This study aimed to contribute to a broader understanding of the effects of climate change on multifunctional cultural landscapes, which are currently promoted by European and national agricultural policies. A helpful tool in the discussion of multifunctionality is the concept of ecosystem services; consisting of provisioning, regulating, cultural, and supporting services, the tool has been introduced to identify synergies for biodiversity conservation and other aspects of human welfare improvements (Tallis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2008</xref>). In addition to the provisioning function, the study area of the March–Thaya floodplains is also a very important area for outdoor recreation and nature-based tourism (Pröbstl-Haider et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2014</xref>), and its regulating function, in the context of flood prevention, may become even more relevant in the future.
