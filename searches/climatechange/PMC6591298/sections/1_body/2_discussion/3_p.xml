<p id="Par22" class="p">Despite regional variation in outcomes, we find a pervasive increase in the demand for electricity to satisfy increased cooling needs in multiple sectors. For Europe, a north–south gradient of impacts of opposing sign generates a median 2% net reduction in the total final energy, on par with the findings of fuel-specific studies
