  <p class="p">Species tested (a, b), experimental timeline (c, d), and experimental setting (e) of the two complementary experiments performed in 2012 and 2017. The control and the four treatment sets where the colonies were placed were composed of three replicates plus one large buffer tank, which was supplied with filtered seawater. These buffer tanks pumped seawater continuously to the experimental tanks and were used to control their temperature. (*)In the first experiment (2012), the treatments lasted 21, 21, 10 and 8 days respectively. In the second experiment (2017), the latter two treatments (28 and 29°C) were extended to 21 days to ensure the same exposure time to thermal stress across treatments while increasing the amount of information obtained from the experiment as much as possible.
