  <p class="p">Species‐specific Kaplan–Meier estimated survival curves (referred to as the probability of remaining necrosis‐free through time) for each species (a–k) exposed to the different experimental conditions. For 
   <italic class="italic">C. dellechiajei</italic>, only the 18, 26, and 27°C treatments are represented. Furthermore, regarding the species tested in 2012 at 28 and 29°C (whose treatments only lasted 10 and 8 days, respectively; c, g, h, i, j), only these two periods were considered for statistical comparisons at these temperatures. The significance levels of the differences between the control (18°C) and each of the treatments (26, 27, 28 and 29°C) are represented for each species, as follows: ***
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value &lt;0.001, **
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value &lt;0.01, *
   <italic class="italic">p</italic>‐value &lt;0.05 and ns: not significant. Finally, the species have been classified in different groups of resistance according to their upper 
   <italic class="italic">T</italic> (thermal) limit (considered here as the first temperature at which a given species presents a lower probability of remaining healthy throughout the experiment compared to the control conditions)
