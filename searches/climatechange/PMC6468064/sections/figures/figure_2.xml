  <p class="p">Period (in days) until the first signs of necrosis (a) and until 50% of the specimens showed signs of necrosis (b) for every species and every temperature tested (26, 27, 28 and 29°C). The species have been ordered from least to most resistant, with red colored cells representing those with a higher sensitivity to warming and green colored cells representing those with a higher resistance. The species scientific names appear in blue, black or pink if they are cnidarians, poriferans or tunicates, respectively, and are followed by a letter code that indicates their typical growth form (C = cup; E = encrusting; M = massive and T = tree).
