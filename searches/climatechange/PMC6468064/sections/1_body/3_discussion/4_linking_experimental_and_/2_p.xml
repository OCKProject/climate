<p class="p">The high variability of thermal responses observed in our study contributes to explaining why some coralligenous species were more affected than others in previous MMEs linked to warming (Cerrano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Garrabou et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Linares et al.,

 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). Moreover, the high (or low) resistance shown by the species in our thermal experiments was, in most cases, concomitant with the high (or low) vulnerability shown by these species in the past during these warming events (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35045-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). For instance, species such as 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella damicornis</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Leptopsammia pruvoti</italic> that were highly resistant in our aquaria have never been reported as affected during previous warming‐induced MMEs that occurred in the NW Mediterranean Sea. In contrast, other species, such as 
 <italic class="italic">Petrosia ficiformis, Crambe crambe, Alcyonium acaule</italic>or 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae,</italic>which have been greatly impacted during previous warming events (Cerrano et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Cerrano, Magnino, Sarà, Bavestrello, &amp; Gaino, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Cerrano, Totti, Sponga, &amp; Bavestrello, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Garrabou et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Linares et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Parravicini et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Perez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), showed a higher vulnerability to thermal stress in our experiments. Thus, as we hypothesized, species‐specific thermal tolerances seem to play an important role in shaping divergent vulnerabilities in coralligenous species exposed to marine heat waves. Nonetheless, the unexpected differences in the responses among the aquaria thermotolerance experiments and observations in the field are also notable in some cases. In our experiment, 
 <italic class="italic">Agelas oroides</italic> presented the highest resistance to thermal stress (&gt; 21 days at 29°C) despite having sporadically been impacted during previous warming‐induced MMEs that were triggered at lower temperatures (Garrabou et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Conversely, 
 <italic class="italic">Dysidea avara</italic>was one of the most sensitive species in our experiment, while to our knowledge, no records of mass mortality linked to marine heat waves exist for this species in the NW Mediterranean. Such paradoxes have been noted in previous studies on mass mortality and bleaching events both in tropical and temperate species and have been attributed to the multifactorial nature of these events. A clear example of this is the Mediterranean coral 
 <italic class="italic">Cladocora caespitosa</italic>(Ehrenberg, 1834), which, despite suffering recurrent warming‐induced mass mortalities in the field, showed resistance in single factor (temperature) experiments performed in aquaria while being impacted when exposed to additional factors such as the presence of invasive species (Kersting et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Other factors that have been highlighted include food availability, pathogens, genetic differences or different physiologic processes (Arizmendi‐Mejía et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Cebrian et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Crisci et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Linares et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pivotto et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Therefore, bearing in mind the complex network of interacting factors that may ultimately determine vulnerability to warming in the field, determining the absolute thermal limits before which mortality of a given species should not be expected remains challenging. Our goal was, instead, to provide a ranking of thermal sensitivities among key components of coralligenous assemblages that could serve as a valuable baseline for better understanding the capacity of response and the trajectories of these species over broad temporal and spatial scales.
