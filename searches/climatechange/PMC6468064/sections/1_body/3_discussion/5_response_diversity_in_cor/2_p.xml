<p class="p">According to the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity (Gonzalez &amp; Loreau, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Yachi &amp; Loreau, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>), a high “response diversity” among functionally redundant organisms is essential for buffering the effects of environmental changes and ensuring the ecosystem functionality that prevents regime shifts (Mori et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In the highly diverse coralligenous outcrops, the diversity of responses shown by the different studied species (including different phyla and different structural roles) suggests that rather than suffering dramatic shifts in response to climate change, many of these assemblages could be susceptible of changing their configuration in the future to less diverse but functionally similar systems, where thermally sensitive species might be replaced by more resistant species. However, the final outcomes will not depend only on species‐specific thermal tolerances. The “winners” and “losers” will also depend on the great variety of specific life histories and functional traits they present, and how these traits favor, or impair their success in a changing sea (Darling, Alvarez‐Filip, Oliver, McClanahan, &amp; Côté, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hughes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Madin et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Van Woesik, Sakai, Ganase, &amp; Loya, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). For instance, populations of species that present faster growth and dispersal or higher reproduction may recover faster after disturbances and/or adapt more easily to rapid environmental changes over generations than populations of species with traits related to a close adaptation to their current environment, extremely slow dynamics or a low dispersal capacity (McKinney &amp; Lockwood, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Likewise, changes in ecological interactions may also determine the final result, as species might be ultimately favored or disfavored by the tolerant or sensitive response of others with which they are ecologically connected (Walther, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). For instance, the loss of key habitat‐forming species (such as some sensitive gorgonians) could potentially trigger cascading effects on the community that could result in an overall reduction in structural complexity and resilience (Ponti et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Similarly, a decline in some massive slow‐growing sponges, such 
 <italic class="italic">Petrosia ficiformis</italic>, could exert a major influence on the overall ecosystem functioning and stability (Bell, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Therefore, whether the eventual “winners” will be able to replace the “losers” in such a way that the complexity and functioning of the coralligenous assemblages are maintained in the future warmed Mediterranean Sea remains to be seen. The contrasting responses to warming among the different components of these assemblages unravelled in this study indicate some promising capacity to buffer future warming effects. However, steering coralligenous outcrops in a way that their functionality is safeguarded in the face of climate change will be challenging and will necessarily depend upon an extensive understanding of the interplay between the functional and life history traits of coralligenous key species, their ecological interactions and their species‐specific vulnerabilities to climatic disturbances.
