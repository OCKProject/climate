<p class="p">Forecasting temperature effects on ecological communities require a deep understanding of how temperature may influence the physiology of their different members. Thus, as oceans keep warming, community‐wide thermal sensitivity studies are becoming a powerful tool for reducing the uncertainty about the future composition, structure and functionality of marine communities facing climate change (Beveridge, Petchey, &amp; Humphries,

In this study, we explored the ranges of thermal sensitivity among structurally, functionally and taxonomically different components of Mediterranean coralligenous assemblages, showing contrasting responses to warming and suggesting the presence of potential “winners” and “losers” in the face of climate change.
