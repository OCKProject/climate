<p class="p">In our study, the experimental responses to thermal stress ranged from completely resistant species that did not suffer necrosis in any of the treatments (&gt;21 days at 29°C) to sensitive species, which suffered necrosis after short‐term exposure (5–9 days) to the lowest‐temperature treatment of 26°C. In between these extremes, different levels of tolerance were found, including highly resistant species, for which 28°C represented the upper thermal limit that significantly reduced their probability of not suffering mortality, and intermediately tolerant species, which despite being affected at 26°C, did not suffer generalized necrosis until 1 week of exposure to 27°C. Bearing in mind that summer heat waves capable of sustaining temperatures between 26°C and 29°C for several days might become increasingly frequent during the next decades in diverse NW Mediterranean locations (Galli et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), our results suggest potential differences in climate change vulnerability among co‐occurring species dwelling in coralligenous assemblages. Indeed, differences between the members of the community were observed in our experiments to the extent that even the two morphotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae</italic>presented contrasting thermal responses. Regardless of the possible mechanisms behind these differences, which in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae</italic>could include the presence of highly bioactive secondary metabolites only in the “slender” morphotype as chemical defences induced for coping with environmental changes (Cachet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Reverter et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), our results represent a good example of the diversity of responses to warming found among structurally, functionally and taxonomically related organisms dwelling in coralligenous outcrops. Previous studies dealing with habitat‐forming emblematic species from these assemblages, such as the red gorgonian 
 <italic class="italic">Paramuricea clavata</italic> (Risso, 1826), the white gorgonian 
 <italic class="italic">Eunicella singularis</italic> (Esper, 1791), the red coral 
 <italic class="italic">Corallium rubrum</italic> (Linnaeus, 1758) or the bryozoans 
 <italic class="italic">Myriapora truncata</italic>(Pallas, 1766) and 
 <italic class="italic">Pentapora fascialis</italic>(Pallas, 1766), have already pointed to such diversity (Crisci et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Linares et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pagès‐Escolà et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>; Torrents et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). However, the low number of studied species impeded the assessment of whether the response diversity was limited or widespread at the community level. Our results reinforce the latter possibility and suggest that regardless of their phyla and/or structural role, some species from these habitats could be living closer to their thermal limits than others and therefore might be more vulnerable under future warming scenarios.
