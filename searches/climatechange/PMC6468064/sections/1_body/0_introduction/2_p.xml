<p class="p">From polar oceans to tropical seas, climate change dramatically affects marine ecosystems by influencing processes at all levels of biological organization (Doney et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Poloczanska et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Scheffers et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Moreover, this anthropogenic pressure will continue to cause unprecedented impacts in the oceans during the next decades as global sea surface temperatures continue to rise and marine heat waves become more frequent and intense (Bellard, Bertelsmeier, Leadley, Thuiller, &amp; Courchamp, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Oliver et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). However, climate change effects have contrasting impacts on biotas (McKinney &amp; Lockwood, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Therefore, understanding how different species, populations and communities will respond to warming is key to developing specific conservation and management strategies aimed at enhancing the resilience of vulnerable marine ecosystems.
