<p class="p">In this study, we experimentally assessed the thermal response of 10 abundant, representative and widely distributed species from these communities that belong to different phyla and encompass contrasting growth forms. The main aim was to explore whether co‚Äêoccurring species of these highly diverse habitats differ in their thermal sensitivities, as field observations suggest, in view to discuss the implications of climate change on the composition and functioning of these key Mediterranean habitats. Our results contribute to filling the gap of thermotolerance data for coralligenous assemblages and suggest the presence of potential winners and losers in the face of ocean warming.</p>
