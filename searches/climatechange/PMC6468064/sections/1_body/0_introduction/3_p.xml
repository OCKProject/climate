<p class="p">Coastal benthic communities such as tropical and temperate reefs are among the most biologically diverse and socioeconomically valuable systems on the planet (Ballesteros,

 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Spalding, Ravilious, &amp; Green, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Nonetheless, when facing global warming, they are especially under threat. As migrating toward more thermally suitable conditions is not an option for most sessile species, most organisms from these communities will be compelled to rely on effective acclimatization (an adjustment of physiology via phenotypic plasticity) or adaptation (an increased abundance of tolerant genotypes over generations) processes to prevail. Although these two mechanisms that evolved for coping with environmental change will likely allow diverse species and/or populations to persist (Palumbi, Barshis, Traylor‐Knowles, &amp; Bay, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), increasing evidence indicates that the unusually high rates of warming and the increasing frequency of extreme events may prevent many others from effectively doing so (Heron et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Hoegh‐Guldberg, Poloczanska, Skirving, &amp; Dove,

 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). In this situation, it is likely that as temperatures continue to rise species with lower thermal thresholds will more frequently be exposed to temperatures beyond their tolerance limits (especially during marine heat waves), potentially hindering adaption/acclimatization processes and favoring responses that range from sublethal effects to death and local extinction (Somero, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The likely loss of such sensitive species would not only change the composition of benthic communities but also diminish the functions and services that they provide. However, if there is response diversity among functionally redundant organisms, the insurance hypothesis of biodiversity suggests that the overall ecosystem functionality may be stabilized through compensatory dynamics among species (Gonzalez &amp; Loreau, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Mori, Furukawa, &amp; Sasaki, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Yachi &amp; Loreau, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0068" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Exploring species‐specific thermal sensitivities among different components of benthic communities is, therefore, a key step toward forecasting the future composition and functionality of these communities in the face of climate change. However, while important efforts in this direction have been taken in shallow tropical reefs, thermotolerance analyses in temperate benthic communities largely lag behind (Kersting et al.,
