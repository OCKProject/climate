<p class="p">Despite the great differences observed between the species, we did not observe clear patterns indicating a higher thermotolerance of poriferans versus cnidarians or vice versa. In fact, the probability of displaying necrotic specimens for these two phyla only differed at 26°C (

Most importantly, when considering the percentage of affected specimens or the trends in mean percentage of tissue necrosis over time in every treatment, most of the differences were found within each group, with both poriferans and cnidarians showing resistant and sensitive species (Figures

 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Eventually, although statistical analyses could not be performed regarding the growth form given the low number of species in each group, the different upper thermal limits shown by the species with an equivalent morphology suggests that contrasting responses to warming also occur between species with similar structural roles (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
