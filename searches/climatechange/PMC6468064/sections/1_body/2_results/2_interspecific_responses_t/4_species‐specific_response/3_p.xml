<p class="p">Among the cnidarians, the most resistant species was 
 <italic class="italic">Leptopsammia pruvoti,</italic>which, similar to the sponge 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella damicornis,</italic>presented 28°C as its upper thermal limit (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). Moreover, even after 8 days of exposure to the highest temperature treatment of 29°C, the mean percentage of tissue necrosis remained relatively low (29.7% ± 10.80; mean ± 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>d). With a lower degree of resistance, the “slender morphotype” of 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Alcyonium acaule</italic>presented an intermediate tolerance (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>e, g). Although these two species withstood 21 days at 26°C with very few specimens affected, both showed large percentages of affected specimens and mean tissue necrosis at any higher temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a–d and 5a–d). In fact, 
 <italic class="italic">Alcyonium acaule</italic> followed a similar pattern to the sensitive stocky morphotype of 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae</italic>at 27, 28 and 29°C
 <italic class="italic">,</italic>suffering substantial injury (&gt;80% of tissue death) in most of its colonies relatively quickly after the first signs of necrosis appeared (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b–d).
