<p class="p">Among the poriferans, 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella damicornis</italic> and especially 
 <italic class="italic">Agelas oroides</italic> were highly resistant (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, d). The former was not affected when exposed to 26°C (21 days) and needed two weeks to show the first signs of necrosis at 27°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Moreover, at the end of this treatment, it displayed low mean levels of necrosis (13.3% ± 9.1; mean ± 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>f). However, in contrast to 
 <italic class="italic">Agelas oroides,</italic> many of the 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella damicornis</italic> specimens were affected at 28 and 29°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>g, h). With a lower degree of resistance, the sponge 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella polypoides</italic>presented an intermediate response, mostly resisting 21 days at 26°C but showing notable percentages of affected specimens and mean tissue necrosis at any higher temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>f and 4e‐h). Eventually, the sponges 
 <italic class="italic">Crambe crambe, Dysidea avara,</italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">Petrosia ficiformis</italic>displayed a sensitive response to thermal stress (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>h–j). These three sponges showed signs of necrosis from 7 to 9 days at 26 and 27°C and from 1 to 2 days at any higher temperature (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Most importantly, even in the lowest‐temperature treatment, every 
 <italic class="italic">Dysidea avara</italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">Petrosia ficiformis</italic> specimen suffered necrosis (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e). On its part, although the percentage of affected specimens at 26°C was lower in 
 <italic class="italic">Crambe crambe</italic> (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>e)
 <italic class="italic">,</italic> this sponge was the one with the highest mean percentage of necrotic tissue at this temperature (43.2% ± 11.1; mean ± 
 <italic class="italic">SE</italic>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>e).
