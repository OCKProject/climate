<p class="p">The most resistant species to warming was the sponge 
 <italic class="italic">Agelas oroides</italic>, which did not show any kind of necrotic tissue throughout any of the treatments (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Conversely, the most sensitive species was the stocky morphotype of the cnidarian 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae,</italic>which showed the first signs of necrosis after only 5 days at 26°C and after only 1–2 days at any of the higher temperatures (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Between these extremes, a whole range of different responses to thermal stress was found, including highly resistant species (upper thermal limit ≥28°C), species with an intermediate response (upper thermal limit = 27°C) and sensitive species (upper thermal limit = 26°C) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
