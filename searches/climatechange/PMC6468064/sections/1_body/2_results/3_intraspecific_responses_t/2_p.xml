While the “slender” morphotype was barely affected when placed at 26°C (first signs after 18 days) and did not show any signs of necrosis until 8 days at 27°C (26% mean necrosis at the end of the experiment), the “stocky” morphotype was the most sensitive species of all, showing signs of necrosis after only 5 days at 26°C and after 1–2 days at a higher temperature, which was followed by a rapid increase in the tissue necrosis in many of its individuals (up to 100%; Figures
