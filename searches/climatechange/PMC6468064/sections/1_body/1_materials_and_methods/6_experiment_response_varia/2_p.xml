<p class="p">As the response variable, we measured the percentage of necrotic tissue in each specimen, which was visually monitored on a daily basis. This variable has been widely used for coralligenous assemblages both in field mortality assessments and laboratory experiments as a proxy of partial and/or total mortality following disturbance (Cebrian, Uriz, Garrabou, &amp; Ballesteros,

 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Following these similar previous studies, we considered necrotic tissue to be all areas with evident signs of irreversible damage, which may include the following: the loss of tissue, denudation/exposure of the skeleton, the loss of coloration derived from the total or partial loss of living tissue and/or the colonization by saprophytic microorganisms (see Supporting information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). The samples displaying no signs of damage were scored as 0% necrotic, while those exhibiting total tissue necroses were scored as 100%. From these data, we obtained the following indicators for each species: the percentage of affected specimens (those presenting a tissue necrosis percentage &gt;0%) per day, the mean percentage of tissue necrosis per day (calculated as the average percentage of tissue necrosis of all the specimens from the same species pooled together in a given day), the period (in days) until the first signs of necrosis were detected, and finally, the period (in days) until 50% of the specimens showed necrosis. We used these different metrics because they describe both the timing and magnitude of the necrosis of species exposed to thermal stress. Eventually, for the ascidian 
 <italic class="italic">Cystodytes dellechiajei,</italic>the level of tissue necrosis at 28 and 29°C could not be accurately assessed due to the incipient process of fission that some colonies suffered throughout these two treatments, which usually started with tissue loss in the part where the colony would end up fragmenting (Supporting information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>j). Previous studies have shown that in the field, fissions of 
 <italic class="italic">Cystodytes dellechiajei</italic>colonies are not rare and do not seem to occur following any clear temporal pattern throughout the year. However, they usually precede the death of colonies (López‐Legentil, Ruchty, Domenech, &amp; Turon, 
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). In our experiments, fissions were only observed at 28 and 29°C, indicating that they might have been triggered by thermal stress. However, as this was not explicitly tested and the observed loss of tissue seemed to be related in many colonies to these fissions instead of to a direct lethal effect of warming, the onset of the necrosis was unclear, and this species was excluded from the analysis at these two temperatures.
