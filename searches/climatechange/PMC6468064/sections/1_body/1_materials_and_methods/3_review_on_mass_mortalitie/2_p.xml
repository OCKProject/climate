<p class="p">We reviewed all information available in the scientific literature regarding warming‐ induced MMEs reported on any of the 10 selected species that occurred in the North‐Western (NW) Mediterranean from 1983 to 2017. In particular, we followed the same methodology described by Rivetti, Fraschetti, Lionello, Zambianchi, and Boero (
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and Marbà et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35045-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and expanded the search to 2017. From this combined search, we only selected articles that reported the mass mortality of any of the 10 selected species, referred to the NW Mediterranean and in which the mortality was directly attributed to warming. The resulting information regarding dates, locations, depths, species affected, identified cause, and references can be found in Supporting information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35045-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>. This information allowed us to investigate whether experimental species‐specific thermal sensitivities were concomitant to the level of vulnerability shown in the field by the different selected species during previous MMEs.
