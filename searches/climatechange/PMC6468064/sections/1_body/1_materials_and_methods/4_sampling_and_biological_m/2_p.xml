<p class="p">Two complementary experiments were conducted in June‐July 2012 and 2017 with specimens from two different sets of species collected at depth of 15–20 m in Medes Islands MPA (Spain, NW Mediterranean; see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In the first experiment, conducted in 2012, individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">Leptopsammia pruvoti,</italic>the apical tips (3–5 cm) of 
 <italic class="italic">Alcyonium acaule</italic>colonies and fragments of 
 <italic class="italic">Petrosia ficiformis, Dysidea avara</italic>and 
 <italic class="italic">Crambe crambe</italic>were sampled. In the second experiment, conducted in 2017, the sampling included medium‐sized colonies containing 10 to 15 polyps from the “stocky” and “slender” morphotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae,</italic>7 cm apical fragments from 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella polypoides,</italic>specimens of 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella damicornis,</italic>fragments of 
 <italic class="italic">Agelas oroides</italic>and medium‐sized colonies ~3–5 cm in diameter from 
 <italic class="italic">Cystodytes dellechiajei</italic>. Overall, five species were tested in 2012 and six in 2017, with sampling effort limited as much as possible to reduce disturbance to the populations while maintaining the robustness of the experimental design. In total, samples from 45–75 healthy adult specimens from each species were collected. Moreover, all samples were chosen to have a similar size between 3 and 7 cm (depending on the species) to be easy to manipulate, comparable and suitable for aquaria experiments.
