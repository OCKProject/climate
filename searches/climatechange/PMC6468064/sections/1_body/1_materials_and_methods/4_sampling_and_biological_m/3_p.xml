<p class="p">After collection, the specimens were immediately transported in coolers to the Aquarium Experimental Zone of the Institute of Marine Sciences in Barcelona (ICM‐CSIC) where they were placed into the aquaria and acclimated for one week in an open system with 50 μm sand‐filtered running seawater at a natural temperature (17–18°C). The 
 <italic class="italic">Leptopsammia pruvoti, Alcyonium acaule, Crambe crambe, Petrosia ficiformis, Dysidea avara and Agelas oroides</italic>samples were fixed to a plastic net as a surface by thin rubber bands. The 
 <italic class="italic">Parazoanthus axinellae, Axinella damicornis and Cystodytes dellechiajei</italic>specimens were fixed to glass plates using coral putty (Coralfix Superfast, Grotech). Finally, the 
 <italic class="italic">Axinella polypoides</italic>tips were fixed to experimental plates using stainless steel needles of 0.30 mm in diameter to keep them in a vertical position similar to what they present in the field.
