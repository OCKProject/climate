<p class="p">To assess the response of the selected species to thermal stress, four temperature treatments were established at 26, 27, 28 and 29°C for periods that ranged from 8 to 21 days. In the experiment conducted in 2012, the treatments lasted 21, 21, 10 and 8 days, respectively. In 2017, the latter two treatments (28 and 29°C) were extended to 21 days to have the same exposure time to thermal stress across treatments while increasing the amount of information obtained from the experiment as much as possible (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b, d). These temperature treatments were selected with the specific goal of determining and comparing the thermotolerance responses and thresholds of the species and after no signs of necrosis were observed in previous trials performed in both years at a lower temperature of 25°C (21 days). Moreover, the chosen treatments represent extreme conditions that have sporadically been observed in the Mediterranean Sea during MMEs and are expected to occur more frequently in the future: short periods (&lt;10 days) with a high mean temperature reaching more than 27°C, and long periods (approximately three weeks) at a warm temperature (≥ 25°C; Bensoussan, Romano, Harmelin, &amp; Garrabou,
