<p class="p">The thermotolerance experiments encompassed one acclimatization week at 17–18°C for all the aquaria. After this period, the temperature of the control set remained constant (17–18°C), while it was increased in the treatment sets for one week at daily acclimation rates of 1.14, 1.29, 1.43 and 1.57°C (at a common rate of 0.5°C per hour in every treatment within the same day) until reaching 26, 27, 28 or 29°C, respectively. Then, the temperatures were kept constant for a maximum of 21 days (Figure

We decided to acclimate the species exposed to different temperature treatments during the same period of one week rather than at the same rate to keep them exposed to experimental conditions the exact same number of days throughout the experiments and given that previous studies dealing with other related co‐occurring species from coralligenous assemblages showed no effect of different acclimation rates in the resulting upper thermal limits of the studied species (Crisci et al.,
