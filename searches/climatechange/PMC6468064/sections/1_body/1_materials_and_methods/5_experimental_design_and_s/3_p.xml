<p class="p">The thermotolerance experiments involved five aquarium sets that corresponded to one control and four treatment tanks. Each aquarium set was composed of three replicates (3 tanks of 70 L each) where 5–6 species and 3–5 individuals per species were placed, plus one buffer tank (70 L) that was used to control the temperature of the water. The buffer tank was supplied with 50‐μm sand‐filtered Mediterranean seawater (pumped from 15 m depth), and from there, the water was carried directly into the experimental tanks, functioning as an open system (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35045-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>e). In addition, every tank was equipped with submersible pumps to facilitate water circulation as well as individual heaters, temperature controllers and HOBO temperature data loggers (registering temperatures every 10 min) to monitor the temperatures throughout the experiment. During the entire duration of the experiment, the specimens were fed three times per week by combining 3ml of a liquid mixture of particles between 10 to 450 μM in size (Bentos Nutrition Marine Active Suplement, Maim, Vic, Spain) in each tank on days 2 and 6 and a tablet of frozen cyclops (Ocean nutrition, Antwerp, Belgium) on day 4.
