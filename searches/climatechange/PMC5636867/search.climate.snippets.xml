  <result pre="and finally, I assume that many actions that result in" exact="climate" post="harms are performed from a state of ignorance about"/>

  <result pre="three different ways in which agents might become ignorant of" exact="climate" post="change. In all three cases the agents fail to"/>

  <result pre="Tex’s strong disposition to be skeptical toward the findings of" exact="climate" post="scientists, all of whom he takes to be brainwashed"/>
  <result pre="Despite all of this, Tex could come to know that" exact="climate" post="change is real and that he should opt for"/>

  <result pre="on the other hand, her failure to look into whether" exact="climate" post="change is real and worrisome was also performed in"/>
  <result pre="to look into things (and for the subsequent ignorance about" exact="climate" post="change) by tracing the agent’s ignorance about her obligation"/>
  <result pre="believing that one ought to look into the issue of" exact="climate" post="change. Perhaps one ought to look into engaging in"/>
  <result pre="one ought to investigate the reality and seriousness of global" exact="climate" post="change, which is the procedural epistemic obligation of which"/>

  <result pre="this meta-inquiry (i.e. to investigate whether she should investigate whether" exact="climate" post="change is real) must rest on some still prior"/>
  <result pre="investigate whether one should investigate whether one should investigate whether" exact="climate" post="change is real. The only way to halt this"/>
  <result pre="with Norm. Recall that Norm could come to know that" exact="climate" post="change is real and that he should opt for"/>
  <result pre="his mind that he should examine the question of whether" exact="climate" post="change is occurring, then he does not knowingly or"/>
  <result pre="of any procedural epistemic obligation to investigate the reality of" exact="climate" post="change. Note that it does not follow from the"/>
  <result pre="believing that he ought to examine the question of whether" exact="climate" post="change is occurring, given that he already believes explicitly,"/>
  <result pre="At no point does he knowingly fail to investigate the" exact="climate" post="change issue. And, given his history, it is not"/>
  <result pre="it is not that he comes to his skepticism about" exact="climate" post="change, which is fueled by a slate of regularly"/>
  <result pre="volitionists would hold that Tex is also non-culpably ignorant about" exact="climate" post="change. Before moving on to discuss Strat’s strategic ignorance,"/>
  <result pre="take stock what volitionism entails generally for culpable ignorance about" exact="climate" post="change. I chose these cases because they plausibly typify"/>
  <result pre="which many people come to have their false beliefs about" exact="climate" post="change. Norm is like anyone else affected by incuriosity"/>
  <result pre="insensitivity to their role in realizing harms brought about by" exact="climate" post="change may suffer a deficit of intellectual virtue, and"/>
  <result pre="occur somewhere in the etiology of the false belief that" exact="climate" post="change is not occurring, the agent in question would"/>
  <result pre="may be just as common. Unfortunately, the public discussion about" exact="climate" post="science in these regions is dominated by well-funded, badly"/>
  <result pre="is the environment within which Tex formed his beliefs about" exact="climate" post="change, then it should not be surprising that he"/>
  <result pre="ilk would not be blameworthy for any failures to mitigate" exact="climate" post="harms that are predicated on that ignorance. Strat’s case"/>
  <result pre="not clear whether Strat believes that he should investigate whether" exact="climate" post="change is real. It could be that he indeed"/>
  <result pre="is blameworthy for his ignorant failure to take steps toward" exact="climate" post="change mitigation. However, Strat’s hesitation about asking his neighbor"/>
  <result pre="change mitigation. However, Strat’s hesitation about asking his neighbor about" exact="climate" post="science might stem from his own belief that it"/>
  <result pre="would be good or perhaps prudent to investigate whether antrhopogenic" exact="climate" post="change is occurring. One may take oneself to have"/>
  <result pre="that few agents would be culpable for their ignorance about" exact="climate" post="change. This result stems from the relative scarcity of"/>
  <result pre="the relative scarcity of witting belief-mismanagement in the context of" exact="climate" post="change. It’s plausible to suppose that, like Norm, Tex,"/>
  <result pre="view has for the question of individual moral responsibility for" exact="climate" post="change associated harms is significant. It shows that even"/>
  <result pre="issues of establishing a causal link between individual action and" exact="climate" post="harms are solved, it may still be the case"/>
  <result pre="would fail to be morally responsible for failing to mitigate" exact="climate" post="change, given that they act from ignorance that is"/>
  <result pre="are relatively straightforward in non-ignorance cases. Suppose I know that" exact="climate" post="change is a serious moral issue and that I"/>
  <result pre="are relevantly similar to Arpaly’s Solomon. Is their ignorance that" exact="climate" post="change is a serious threat the manifestation of a"/>

  <result pre="way that would make them culpable for their ignorance about" exact="climate" post="change? Before bringing the quality of will view to"/>

  <result pre="Let’s start again with Norm. Does his failure to investigate" exact="climate" post="change express or manifest a lack of good will?"/>
  <result pre="never crosses Norm’s mind to look into the seriousness of" exact="climate" post="change indicate a failure to respond to the moral"/>
  <result pre="alia the various threats to human well being posed by" exact="climate" post="change. There are various explanations for why Norm might"/>

  <result pre="to find any reason to read about or otherwise investigate" exact="climate" post="change less salient. Call this version of the case"/>
  <result pre="in his failure to believe that he should look into" exact="climate" post="change. For him the thought of delving into the"/>
  <result pre="this Dense-Norm. Though both Norms fail even to consider whether" exact="climate" post="change is really a threat, the verdict that the"/>
  <result pre="quality of will? Norm’s ignorance about his obligation to investigate" exact="climate" post="change is predicated on the belief that he can"/>
  <result pre="on the belief that he can do nothing to combat" exact="climate" post="change. The question for the quality of will theorist"/>
  <result pre="Norm’s forming this belief and his subsequent failure to investigate" exact="climate" post="change express a lack of good will. There are"/>
  <result pre="some individuals really may simply never stop to think about" exact="climate" post="change. Dense-Norm may never consume media in which it"/>
  <result pre="may fail to investigate and thus fail to know about" exact="climate" post="change. On the quality of will view, this version"/>
  <result pre="should Dense-Norm’s ignorance persist after repeated exposure to evidence that" exact="climate" post="change is an issue of significant moral importance, then"/>
  <result pre="incuriosity with respect to the science and moral significance of" exact="climate" post="change is an aspect of a general self-centeredness that"/>
  <result pre="become aware of a possible link between his actions and" exact="climate" post="change. His self-centeredness would wall off any avenues of"/>
  <result pre="question of whether Dense-Norm’s failure even to consider issues about" exact="climate" post="change and the potential contribution of his actions to"/>

  <result pre="discuss what it entails about agents who are ignorant about" exact="climate" post="change. My more modest goal was to enrich previous"/>
  <result pre="the woefully large set of agents who are ignorant about" exact="climate" post="change, there are different verdicts that one can come"/>
  <result pre="important conclusion one may draw is that culpable ignorance about" exact="climate" post="change may be widespread enough that we are often"/>

  <result pre="Getting clarity on these issues also has broader implications for" exact="climate" post="ethics for at least two reasons. First, the issue"/>

  <result pre="relevant to the project of putting the theories developed by" exact="climate" post="ethicists into practice. The various innovative theories discussed in"/>
