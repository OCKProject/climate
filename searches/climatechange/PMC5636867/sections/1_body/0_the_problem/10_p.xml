<p id="Par24" class="p">The plan for the rest of the paper is as follows. In “Some Stories of Ignorance” section, I introduce three different ways in which agents might become ignorant of climate change. In all three cases the agents fail to perform the same obligatory emissions-curbing action due to their ignorance. After discussing some shortcomings in present attempts to categorize ignorance in these cases as culpable or not, I move on in “Two Theories of Moral Responsibility for Ignorant Actions and Verdicts” section to examine two recent theories of culpable ignorance, and I show what these theories would entail regarding the culpability of the three ignorance types. “Upshots” section summarizes several theoretical and practical upshots. To foreshadow: the answer to the question posed in the title is “it depends…perhaps less often than you think”.</p>
