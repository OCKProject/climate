<p id="Par58" class="p">Quality of will theories can yield clear verdicts in cases of ignorant actions as well, though it can be trickier. For example, Arpaly discusses the case of Solomon, a sexist whose false beliefs about how women deserve to be treated are perpetuated by his ignorance about certain facts about women. She imagines that Solomon was raised in a milieu that stunted his moral development by sheltering him from certain facts that would make it more difficult for his sexist beliefs to persist (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2002</xref>, 103–4). On her analysis, if this sexist escaped this environment and was confronted daily with evidence that women have all the morally relevant qualities that men have, we would expect him to change his tune. If his belief that say, ‘women are less intellectually capable than men’ were to survive even in the face of many obvious counterexamples, then Arpaly suggests that this manifests a lack of good will. This agent’s ignorance about these factual matters is often classified as ‘motivated ignorance’ (Moody-Adams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">1994</xref>) and it is based on an agent’s failure to be sufficiently concerned to form accurate beliefs about the issue.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18" class="xref">18</xref> Though the details of various quality of will views matter, it suffices for my purposes to adopt Arpaly’s version and see how it applies to the cases. The central question about the cases is whether Norm, Strat, and Tex are relevantly similar to Arpaly’s Solomon. Is their ignorance that climate change is a serious threat the manifestation of a failure to respond to relevant moral reasons? In other words, are they insufficiently concerned with the issue of climate change in a way that would make them culpable for their ignorance about climate change?
