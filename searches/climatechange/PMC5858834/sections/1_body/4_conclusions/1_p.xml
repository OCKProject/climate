<p class="p">Our models, with strong support in niche theory and ecological stability, have shown a significant sensitivity and may be useful in several practical applications within the science of conservation, including in assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems to climate change. We found some worrying evidence that South American forest ecosystems are intrinsically more vulnerable to climate change than other ecosystems. Ongoing climate change can accelerate the loss of ecosystem resilience by promoting erosion of forest biodiversity and leading to another stable state with a lower density of vegetation cover.</p>
