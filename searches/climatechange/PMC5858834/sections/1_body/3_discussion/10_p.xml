 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref087" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>], our results suggest that, due to the close adaptive relationship of ecophysiological and evolutionary patterns between terrestrial ecosystems and climate, the high values of resiliency to changing climatic conditions can only be maintained at the conditions of the optimum climatic niche occupied by the ecosystem. This dependence would thus be reflected in ecosystem responses following a disturbance event [
