<p class="p">The response curve for the stable state of forests also indicates that an incremental change in the climatic stress gradient could trigger large-scale transformations, particularly if a rupture threshold is reached [

This factor may be critical in the short term, with the accelerated levels of transformation currently being experienced, so it is critical to the identify thresholds for rapid forest decline. Even so, it may take decades for forests to restore the services they provide [

In contrast, a larger amount of climate stress would be required for savannas or grasslands to become more susceptible to large-scale transformations. It is possible to explain their higher tolerance to climatic stress due to better adaptation to water deficit and the fire effect on biota [
