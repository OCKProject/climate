<p class="p">In the context of robust transformations induced by climate change, the resilience estimated from the climatic niche emerges as an alternative to the traditional metrics of biological diversity (such as richness or species composition). This new metric can be interpreted as a measure of ecosystem health [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>], and may be useful in the design and implementation of conservation strategies at different spatial scales. For example, ecosystem resilience could be monitored in real time to predict catastrophic transitional events between stable states as a function of observed or simulated climate changes [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. This method is already available, since remote sensing data are widely available at high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions [
