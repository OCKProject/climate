<p class="p">On the other hand, these new climatic conditions are likely to favor other ecosystem types that display increasing resilience. In this way, the dynamics of resilience within an ecological system with multistability are closely related to transition events between stable states and depend directly on the orientation of change, thus favoring a particular stable state. For example, at the end of the Upper Miocene, there was a reduction in global temperature, and grassland ecosystems dominated most of South America [
