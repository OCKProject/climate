<p class="p">Our results indicate that the terrestrial ecosystems of South America are sensitive to the expected gradual increases in climatic stress, since the relative frequency of ecosystems decrease as conditions become marginal for the climate niche of the ecosystem in question. However, there are differences in the form of responses between different vegetation classes. When the exponential model parameters were compared between ecosystems, forests presented the least resistance to climate stress, indicating a higher sensitivity intrinsic to changes in climate. These results suggest that forests are more sensitive to climate variability [
