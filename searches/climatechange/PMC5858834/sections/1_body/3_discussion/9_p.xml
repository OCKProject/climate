<p class="p">Our results indicate that, in this sense, savannas demonstrate an advantage over forests. Savannas are successful in a wide range of moisture and temperature availability and tolerate strong seasonal variations. Savannas can, therefore, maintain a steady tree cover state despite climatic variation, which confers a tremendous adaptive potential to the ecosystem if it is exposed to non-analogous climatic conditions.</p>
