 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>], evidence of their higher vulnerability to climate change, representing a low adaptive capacity compared to other ecosystems that can maintain high resilience values under a wide range of climatic conditions. Moreover, in theory, for an adaptation event to occur, the adaptive strategy should be within the limits of the diversity of responses, i.e., phenotypic plasticity, displayed in the current climate. Outside the boundaries of the climatic niche, there would be slow adaptation, and the ecosystem would succumb to a loss of structure and function until it reached a point of rupture or another stable state.
