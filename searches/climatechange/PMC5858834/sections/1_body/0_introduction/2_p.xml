<p class="p">Maintaining the structure and functioning of ecosystems over a broad-scale climate gradient range [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>] suggests that each stable state of the ecosystem must be strictly adapted and evolved under a specific subset of abiotic conditions, enclosed in the multidimensional space of its climatic niche. Thus, under such a combination of conditions, the ecosystem is expected to have a higher capacity to absorb disturbances and recover the condition closer to the original state in the shortest time after a disturbance. Also, it is important to note that there is a strong correlation between ecosystem resilience and ecosystem structure.
