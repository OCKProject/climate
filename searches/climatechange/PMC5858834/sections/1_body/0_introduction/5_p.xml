<p class="p">Overall, there are still many uncertainties about what effects climate change will have on the resilience and response of terrestrial ecosystems in structural and functional terms [

 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In this sense, it is fundamental to evaluate the intrinsic vulnerability of terrestrial ecosystems through a decomposition into three different axes: sensitivity, exposure, and adaptive capacity of the ecosystem [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Here, we propose to objectively estimate the comparative sensitivities of terrestrial ecosystems in South America from an analysis of ecosystem resistance to a gradual increase in climatic stress. Also, we will briefly assess the likelihood of exposure to unfavorable climatic conditions by identifying the propensity of each stable climate state to cope with non-analogous climate changes within or outside its optimal climatic niche, taking into account observed and simulated climate trends. Finally, to infer the adaptive capacity of ecosystems to changes in climate, we will assess the amount of climate variability that the ecosystem can tolerate without losing its structure and function.
