 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In particular, projections for South America indicate that by the end of this century the continent is likely to be subjected to non-analogous climatic conditions, having little overlap with the current climate [

This represents a high risk to the extraordinary biodiversity on the continent due to the high climatic sensitivity of its ecosystems, which could lead to the compromise of a vast set of goods and services provided to humans [
