<p class="p">Despite recent theoretical and methodological advances, resilience is a concept that remains qualitative [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and quantification at large scales can be challenging [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. To overcome this limitation, we propose the methodological coupling of two significant bodies of theoretical knowledge in ecology: ecological stability theory [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and ecological niche theory [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Some previous studies have already proposed measuring ecosystem resilience at large scales by calculating the likelihood of finding an ecosystem at a given level of precipitation [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. However, none of the authors considered the robust theoretical framework and the recent methodological advances of ecological niche modeling [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. With this approach, it is possible to construct spatially explicit models that measure the resilience of ecosystems through a metric of climate suitability, based on the multidimensional niche preferably occupied by them.
