<p class="p">To describe energy availability across the continent, we used the WorldClim temperature database [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], which consists of a climatological average between the years 1960 and 1990, with data from stations around the globe. The spatial resolution of the dataset is 0.041° (~ 5 km) and was copied from '
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldclim.org/version1" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.worldclim.org/version1</ext-link>' in ‘tiff’ format. Although it has the same limitation of a low density of meteorological stations for the Neotropical region, the variable in question does not present significant variability near the equator, so that the quality of the observed data is not compromised. Finally, we selected four bioclimatic predictors related to energy availability and moisture, which originate from the ecophysiological point of view of ecosystems: (1) annual cumulative precipitation (ACP), (2) precipitation seasonality coefficient (PSC), (3) average annual temperature (AAT), and (4) annual range of temperature (ART).
