<p class="p">To describe the pattern of moisture availability, we used current precipitation data for South America from the climatic dataset CHPclim (v.1.0), produced by the Climate Hazards Group’s Precipitation Climatology. It is a combination of satellite data, physiographic indicators, and standard in situ climatological data, with data available from 1980 to 2009. The final product is a monthly global climatic precipitation measure with a spatial resolution of 0.05° (~6 km) [

CHPclim has a critical comparative advantage over other precipitation climatic bases available for South America (e.g., WorldClim): It has a better fit for regions with low densities of meteorological stations and high variability of precipitation, such as the Amazon, and responds satisfactorily to complex terrain, such as in the Andes Mountain Range [
