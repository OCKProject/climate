<p class="p">The high variability can partially explain this diversity of ecosystems in latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, which directly influence the patterns of moisture and energy availability throughout the continent. Based on the climatic dataset of this study, we observed that average annual temperatures could vary between negative values at high altitudes (e.g., the Andes Mountain Range) to 30 °C in the low-altitude equatorial tropical zone. The annual range of temperature varies mainly as a function of latitude, being low near the equator, and can reach 18 °C in high latitudes. In some regions of the tropical zone, it can rain more than 6000 mm·year
