<p class="p">After correction of land use classification inaccuracies, the raster database was converted to a presence-absence binary, where each map pixel was converted to a point in vector format. In total, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 37763 samples were generated for South America, of which 53% were classified as savanna; 38% as forest; and 9% as grassland. These ecosystems are mutually exclusive and geographic substitutes, so when a particular type of ecosystem was recorded as present (1) for a given area, the others were automatically recorded as absent (0) in that same area. These presence-absence data were used as an input in the ecological niche modeling procedure described below. Each point was assigned a geo-referenced signature with longitude and latitude information.
