 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The various modeling methods quantify the relationships between occurrences (presence/absence) and environmental predictors to delimit and adjust the multidimensional environmental niche. The result is the quantification and spatialization of the suitability of the environment for the modeled ecosystem.
