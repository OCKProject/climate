<p class="p">For each method, ten replicates with 75% and 25% partitions were run for training and testing, respectively. Quality of the models produced by the different methods was evaluated using True Skill Statistics (TSS) and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) metrics (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194654.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). We calculated the contribution of each bioclimatic predictor to build and explain the patterns of response variable which varies between zero (lower importance) to 1 (higher importance) (

For the threshold effect, only the models with TSS values equal to or greater than 0.7 were considered for inclusion in the ensemble. The consensus distribution model was then obtained as the arithmetic average taken for the selected models [
