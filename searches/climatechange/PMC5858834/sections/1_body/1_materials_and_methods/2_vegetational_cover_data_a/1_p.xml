<p class="p">To define the terrestrial ecosystems of South America as stable states, we used the variable called tree cover for the year 2001, from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor. This variable describes the percentage of vegetation cover varying between zero and 100% [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] and can be interpreted as the density or abundance of trees. The transition limits between ecosystemâ€™s stable states were inferred from the frequency distribution of the tree cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], which presented a trimodal distribution. Each distribution mode comprises a stable state of a terrestrial ecological system. The grasslands had zero to 5% tree cover; savannas had 5 to 60%, and forests had values above 60%. The original dataset, spanning all of South America, was resampled from a 500-m to a 6-km spatial resolution.
