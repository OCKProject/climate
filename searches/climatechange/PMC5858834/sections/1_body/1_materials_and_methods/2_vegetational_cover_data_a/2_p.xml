<p class="p">Due to the effects of historical changes in land use, mistaken pixel classifications occurred among the three ecosystem classes. Notably, the forest ecosystem (with tree cover between 60 and 100%) was the most sensitive to spectral and radiometric changes following the intrusion of alternative land uses (e.g., selective logging, monocultures, or pastures). To minimize such classification bias, and thus to match the original distribution of the forest ecosystem as closely as possible, we evaluated the classification accuracy by comparing the tree cover with a census database of high-resolution land cover [
 <xref rid="pone.0194654.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Whenever a pixel was classified with a tree cover percentage of less than 60% but classified as forest based on the consensus dataset, the pixel was reclassified to forest.
