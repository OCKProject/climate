<p class="p">Here we present an alternative interpretation for the climate suitability map produced from ecological niche modeling. For the first time, a methodological convergence between predictions of ecological stability and ecological niche theory is explicitly suggested. The phenotypic adaptation of an ecosystem to a given set of climatic conditions has a direct and robust relationship with the resilience of the ecosystem itself. In this sense, the ecosystem is expected to lose resilience as it moves away from the optimal climatic conditions of its niche. Therefore, the product of niche modeling can be interpreted as a continuous and objective measure of resilience, ranging from zero (minimum resilience) to 1000 (maximum resilience) for terrestrial ecosystems in South America.</p>
