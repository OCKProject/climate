<p class="p">We assume that climate stress increases in ecosystems as they move away from their optimal niche. Since the climate suitability gradient, predicted by niche modeling, can be interpreted as an approximation of the fundamental ecosystem niche, we estimate climate stress from a simple inversion of the gradient as predicted by the models. Thus, a band with low climatic suitability is assigned a high level of climatic stress and vice versa.</p>
