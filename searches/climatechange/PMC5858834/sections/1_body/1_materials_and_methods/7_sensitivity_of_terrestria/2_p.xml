<p class="p">Using this climate stress vector (x) as the predictor of the relative frequency of observations for each ecosystem (y), we fit an exponential model according to the equation below:

 </disp-formula> where a and b are the estimated coefficients of the exponential model. The objective was to use the coefficient b, which defines the curve fit of the exponential model to the observed data, as an indicator of the ecosystem resistance to climatic stress. In other words, if a small increment of climatic stress significant changes the ecosystem, we can assume that the ecosystem has low resistance to climatic stress, and consequently a higher value of the coefficient b. Conversely, resistant ecosystems will have a lower value of the coefficient b.
