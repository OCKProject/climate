<p class="p">In a two-dimensional climatic space representing the availability of moisture and energy present in South America, we evaluated the propensity of ecosystems for exposure to non-analogous climatic conditions and their respective adaptive capacities based on the climate space occupied by each ecosystem and its respective observed resilience gradient. We have taken as a reference the observed current climate trends [

In general, both observed and simulated data point to an increase in climatic seasonality associated with increased aridity and temperatures for South America. We, therefore, delimited a polygon for the bidimensional climate space to indicate the likely orientation climate changes on a continental scale. Observed ecosystem resilience data was then compared with the polygon to determine which ecosystems would be most abruptly exposed to unfavorable climatic conditions. In the same sense, it was also possible to observe the response width of ecosystem resilience and, in this way, infer the capacity to adapt to a new climatic reality.
