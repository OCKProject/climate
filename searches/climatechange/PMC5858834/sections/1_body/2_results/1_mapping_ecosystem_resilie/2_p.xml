<p class="p">There is a spatially structured pattern of loss of resilience toward the transition zones between the three ecosystems. Models based on the climatic niche of ecosystems were highly sensitive in detecting that ecotone zones tend to have a lower resilience value than do areas in an optimal climate niche. This pattern reinforces the idea of geographic ecosystem replacement caused by transitional events through the loss of resilience through geographic space and climatic gradient.</p>
