<p class="p">Here we present a continuous metric of spatially explicit ecosystem resilience, based on the climatic niche to which each ecosystem is adapted (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194654.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Grasslands have high resilience at high altitudes and arid environments, such as in the Andes, the Atacama Desert, and Patagonia. Savannas are widely distributed throughout the continent and exhibit high resilience along the continental diagonal polygon as well as to the north of South America. Forests have good resilience near the equator, covering almost entirely the Amazon basin to the foothills of the Andes. Forests also occupy a narrow strip following the Atlantic coast (Atlantic Forest) and the eastern region lying near latitude 50Â° (Araucaria forest). All of these areas show a lower level of resilience than do the forests of the Amazon basin. In the southwestern portion of the continent, the model predicted the presence of a vertical band of temperate forest (Valdivia).
