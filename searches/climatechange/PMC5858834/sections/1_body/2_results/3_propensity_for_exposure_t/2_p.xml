<p class="p">For the energy availability gradient, forests are adapted at high levels of resilience to a narrow range of high average annual temperatures (between 20–28 °C), but tolerate only low variability throughout the year (between 0–5 °C·year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). Outside of this range, there was a drastic loss in ecosystem resilience. On the other hand, savannas have high resilience at average annual temperatures above 10 °C, also supporting temperatures above 25 °C, while their resilience tends to decrease at temperatures below 10 °C. Savannas also persist in places with considerable variation in temperature throughout the year, with ranges up to 20 °C. Grasslands are adapted for temperatures in a wide range, from negative to 20 °C average annual temperatures, and with a large annual thermal amplitude (5 to 20 °C·year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The observed and simulated average temperature trends indicate abrupt increases, as delimited by the gray polygon, which would favor forest ecosystems, provided there is no increase in the annual temperature range. If there is an increase in annual temperature variability, the scenario would be more favorable to savannas at the expense of forests, which would probably lose resilience.
