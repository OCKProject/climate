<p class="p">The moisture availability gradient showed a strong interaction with climate resilience. Forests present high resilience to rainfall above 2000 mm·year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> with a relatively low seasonality (&lt;100%) during the year (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194654.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Savannas are adapted to a precipitation range between 500 and 1800 mm·year
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, so that resilience tends to decrease with increasing seasonality of precipitation and annual rainfall volumes. In contrast, grasslands show high resilience in the gradient range where a more arid climate prevails, with low rainfall volumes and high rainfall seasonality throughout the year. In this sense, if the observed trends are assessed alongside the simulated future climate scenarios, both savannas and grasslands would be favored, while forests would inevitably lose resilience due to moisture reduction.
