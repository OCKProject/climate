<p class="p">Forests and savannas have strong niche-specific adaptive responses to moisture availability persisting over a specific range of the moisture gradient (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194654.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). This suggests a low adaptive capacity to new conditions outside the optimum climatic niche for forest and savanna ecosystems. On the other hand, grasslands show high levels of resilience to a wide range of moisture availability. The pattern is further enhanced by the seasonal axis of precipitation, with grasslands maintaining high levels of resilience for a wide range of moisture availability. The most significant adaptive constraint regarding grassland resilience is regions with rainfall volumes over 2000 mmÂ·year
