<p class="p">Savannas and grasslands would have higher adaptive capacities to changing temperature gradients because they show high resilience at a wide range of temperature combinations. The forest ecosystem, however, has a relatively narrow climatic niche and demonstrates high resilience only for high temperatures with low annual variability. This suggests that savannas and grasslands have a higher adaptive capacity to changes in the energy availability than do forests, which have a narrow climatic niche.</p>
