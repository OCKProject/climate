<p class="p">In general, the three ecosystems presented similar statistical behaviors, with a decrease in their relative frequencies accompanying a gradual increase in climatic stress (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194654.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). However, there are significant differences concerning the forms of the response curves observed for the three ecosystems. For savannas and grasslands, the distribution of observations was more uniform, while forests account for almost 80% of the observations in the range of the lowest climatic stress (close to the climatic optimum). Because of this, savannas and grasslands have a smoother response curve as climate stress increases than do forests. This pattern was also reflected in the value of the exponential model parameter, with forests (b = -0.024) having a value almost double those for grasslands (b = -0.010) and savannas (b = -0.007), indicating that savannas and grasslands have better resistance to climatic stress than do forests.
