<p id="Par24" class="p">Following this scoping phase, we estimated the present and future burden of disease associated with these health outcomes. We followed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention technical guidance for health departments for projecting climate-related disease burden [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>] by, 1) developing a causal pathway linking exposures/environmental hazards to health outcomes, 2) using ensemble projections from global climate models (GCMs) to identify how the exposures/environmental hazards may change in intensity and duration in the future, 3) establishing the historical disease burdens of the health outcomes in our populations, 4) assessing the historical exposure-outcome associations, 5) estimating the health burdens historically and in the projected climate, and then 6) evaluating the uncertainty inherent in the derivation of these different estimates.. The results will help prioritize county level measures to better protect public health in a changing climate. We also present our methods as a model to other states and municipalities, including methods for deriving baseline health data and exposure-response estimates when these are lacking.
