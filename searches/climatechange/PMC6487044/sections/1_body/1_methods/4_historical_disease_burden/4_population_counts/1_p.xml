 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>] were available in BenMAP. We used 2050 population projections from EPA’s Integrated Climate and Land-Use Scenarios (ICLUS) project for the A2 scenario. ICLUS population projections are based on the 2000–2005 U.S. Census population, fertility, and mortality rates by age, sex, and race to project county-specific populations out to 2100 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. For the A2 scenario, the resulting ICLUS population includes an assumption of higher fertility rates. As a sensitivity analysis, we used BenMAP’s pre-loaded Woods &amp; Poole 2050 projections.
