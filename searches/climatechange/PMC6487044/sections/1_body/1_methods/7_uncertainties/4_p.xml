<p id="Par43" class="p">We also evaluated uncertainty in the exposure-response association and the baseline estimates of the health effects themselves, considering differences between studies of similar outcomes and changes in the health effect rates over time. To evaluate the uncertainties in the cost estimate of mortality, we used the estimated 1st and 99th percentiles of the dollar-per-QALY estimate [
