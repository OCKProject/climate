<p id="Par40" class="p">Rather than attempt to assign precise quantitative ranges to the burden-of-disease inputs, we took a qualitative approach. To each source of uncertainty, we assigned values of “low,” “moderate,” or “high,” defined as approximate ranges around the point estimates of ±49% for low, − 99% to − 50% or + 50% to + 199% for moderate, and − 100% or ≥ + 200% for high. This simple scale represents the idea that ranges of effects within half-as-much above or below the point estimate reflect low uncertainty, ranges that include null or protective effects (more than 100% below) or effects more than three times as high reflect high uncertainty, and other ranges reflect moderate uncertainty. We drew on quantitative information when assigning these values, but we discuss additional uncertainties where present.</p>
