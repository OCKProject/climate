<p id="Par42" class="p">In generating the EH and EP day projections, Hayhoe et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] did a bias analysis of each of the GCMs used to generate the “ensemble” mean projection for the US. In short, this analysis was accomplished by comparing the EH or EP days for the period 1960–1999 predicted by the models to those that actually occurred in that period. We reviewed the bias analyses relevant to the GCMs used to generate our historical and projected number of EH and EP days. We regard these as rough estimates of the bias in generating the A2 projection.
