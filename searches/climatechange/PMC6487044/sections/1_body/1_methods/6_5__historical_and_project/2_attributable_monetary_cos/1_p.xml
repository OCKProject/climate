<p id="Par39" class="p">To estimate the monetary statewide costs of the attributable burdens of each disease, we multiplied the period-specific statewide BOD estimates by the per-incident cost of death, renal hospitalization among whites and non-whites, non-accidental ED visit, or GI illness ED visit. The mortality incident cost was the dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) estimated in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio analysis of current dialysis practices relative to less-costly alternatives [

To estimate the cost of heat-associated hospitalization associated with EH, we used a cost of $5400, with additional costs of $1500 for individuals 65–77 and $1600 for individuals 78 and older from a study of hospitalization costs due to heat-related illness [
