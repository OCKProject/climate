Based on the previous analysis suggesting a great reduction or absence of an EH-mortality association beyond 3 days after the EH exposure in this region, we restricted the analysis to the day of through 3 days following the EH exposure. We updated the analysis to use an EH definition that precisely matched that in the available climate projections and to include all ages. Attributable fractions (AFs), or the fraction of deaths attributable to 1 day of EH, were calculated for each ZIP code

Race was not found to be a significant modifier of the EH-mortality association when land cover and socioeconomic characteristics were accounted for. Although green space was found to significantly modify the EH-mortality association, it was not included in the AF estimate due to the fact that green space was a variable used in estimating the number of historical and projected EH days.
