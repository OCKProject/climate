<p id="Par36" class="p">Exposure-response functions were derived from a study examining the effects of heat on morbidity and mortality by Kingsley et al. in Rhode Island [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>], a state with a climate similar to that of Michigan’s, i.e., cold and lacking a dry season and hot summers (Dfa, Dfb) in the Köppen climate classification system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. AFs for all-natural-cause ED visits for EH at 32.2 °C and 35 °C were estimated for the 0–18 age group and the 65 and older age group based on effect estimates of same-day maximum temperature and all-natural cause visits. In contrast to the mortality and hospitalization studies, Kingsley et al. did not estimate effects of temperature on ED visits on days following the EH exposure °s. The association between same-day maximum temperature and all-natural-cause ED visits was not significant in the 18–64 age group. However, associations between 
 <italic class="italic">heat-related</italic> ED visits and warm temperatures were strong in this age group; so heat-related AFs for 32.2 °C and 35 °C were estimated for 18–64 year-olds.
