Renal effects for 2-, 3-, and 4-day long EH events were similar to same-day EH effects, and Ogbomo et al. only estimated effects by age group for same-day EH events. For individuals 65 years of age and older, we used the air conditioning prevalence region 2 (which included Michigan) ZIP-code specific AFs for six-day cumulative effects of EH at 32.2 °C from the U.S. study of effect modification of renal, respiratory and heat-related hospitalizations by Gronlund et al.
