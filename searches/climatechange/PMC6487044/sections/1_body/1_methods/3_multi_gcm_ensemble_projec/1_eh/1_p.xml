<p id="Par27" class="p">The mean annual number of days with maximum temperatures above 32.2 °C and above 35 °C, or EH days, were obtained for two time periods: 1971–2000 (historical) and 2041–2070 (projected) from the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences + Assessments Center [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. These were derived under the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A2 scenario, which is one of the more dire scenarios and assumes greenhouse gas concentrations will continue to increase throughout the twenty-first century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. The historical EH data are the Maurer 1/8-degree gridded daily maximum temperature observations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. The projections were statistically-downscaled data sets from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>] derived from Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 GCMs. Estimates of EH days were provided at a 1/8° grid resolution and were aggregated to match the spatial resolution of the health data (see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Appendix 2 for aggregation details).
