<p id="Par28" class="p">No universal definition of EH exists, and the thresholds of 32.2 °C and 35 °C were chosen for two reasons. Firstly, these correspond to round Fahrenheit temperatures of 90 °F and 95 °F, and extreme caution is advised by the local Detroit National Weather Service office at temperatures over 90 °F [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>]. Although these were well above the minimum-mortality-temperature thresholds of 21–24 °C identified in Gasparrini et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] for cities in Michigan, the 32.2 °C threshold corresponds roughly to a Detroit heat-mortality threshold in Gronlund et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], which used more recent, albeit more spatially constrained, mortality time series. Secondly, time series and case-crossover study designs, on which our estimates are based, can account for mortality displacements of 1–3 weeks, thereby subtracting out the mortality attributable to heat that was among very frail individuals who would have died within 1–3 weeks anyway. Beyond 3 weeks, we are not aware of research quantifying mortality displacement specific to cities in Michigan, although the extent of mortality displacement varies widely between countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. The literature is inconclusive, but there is some suspicion that this mortality displacement is reduced at very high temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Therefore, in using high EH thresholds, we have greater confidence in assigning years, rather than weeks, of life lost to EH.
