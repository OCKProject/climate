<p id="Par67" class="p">Multiplying our estimates of the AF, EP days, GI-illness ED visit incidence rate, and population, we estimated a historical burden-of-disease rate of ED visits for GI illness attributable to EP as 170 ED visits annually, or a rate of 1.7 visits per 100,000 Michigan residents. Assuming an increase of approximately 1 day of EP in the future period, we estimated a future burden of waterborne disease attributable to EP as 220 ED visits annually, or 1.9 visits per 100,000 Michigan residents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Considering that the number of days by which EP events will increase is projected to range spatially between 0.5 days to 2.0 days, depending on the region in Michigan, the EP-associated ED visit rate increase may range spatially from 1.0 to 3.82 visits per 100,000 Michigan residents.
