<p id="Par66" class="p">EH-associated ED visit rates were substantially higher than EH-associated hospitalization rates, with rates of 12 per 100,000 persons (1218 visits statewide) in the historical period and 68 per 100,000 persons (7845 visits statewide) in the projected period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). Given that ED visit rates were much higher than hospitalization rates for EH, we focused the subsequent analyses and discussion of EH-associated morbidity on EH-associated ED visits. Significant heterogeneity between counties was seen, with a 16-fold variation in ED rate between counties at historical and a 6-fold variation in ED rate between counties in the projected period (Fig.
