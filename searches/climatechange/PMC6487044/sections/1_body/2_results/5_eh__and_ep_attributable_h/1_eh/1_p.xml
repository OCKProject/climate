<p id="Par63" class="p">We estimated the rate of all non-accidental mortality associated with EH days to increase sixfold from 0.46 per 100,000 adults aged 20 years and older in the historical period (33 deaths annually statewide, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) to 2.9 per 100,000 adults (240 deaths annually statewide, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>) in the projected period. There was significant heterogeneity between counties, with a 19-fold variation in mortality rate between counties in the historical period and a nine-fold variation between counties in the projected period (Fig.
