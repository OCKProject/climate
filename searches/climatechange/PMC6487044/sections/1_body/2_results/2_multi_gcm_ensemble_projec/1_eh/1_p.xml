<p id="Par53" class="p">By ZIP code, average annual EH days ranged widely, from 0 to 16 days historically and 0–46 days in the projected period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). By both ZIP code and county, the median projected average annual count of EH days was approximately 5 times higher than the historical count. The historical and projected counts of EH days were highly correlated (Spearman r = 0.99), and the six counties (St. Joseph, Wayne, Berrien, Cass, Kalamazoo, and Monroe Counties) with the highest number of EH days were the same in both the historical and projected periods (Additional file
