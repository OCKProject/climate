<p id="Par56" class="p">Across 83 counties, the daily baseline mortality rate for non-accidental deaths ranged from 1.8 to 5.3 deaths per 100,000 persons, with a median of 3.2 deaths per 100,000 persons in the historical period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The median mortality rate in the projected period was slightly higher (3.3 deaths per 100,000 persons). We did not age-standardize these mortality rates, so the wide range of mortality rates partially reflects differing age distributions between counties. For renal hospitalizations, we estimated a statewide daily rate among non-whites in the warm season of 0.24 hospitalizations per 100,000 persons for both periods among individuals under 65 years of age. For older individuals, daily ED visits for non-accidental causes ranged from 34 to 56 visits per 100,000 persons in the historical period, and because of an increased percentage of older adults over time, the median in the projected period was again higher than in the historical period (53 vs. 44 visits per 100,000 persons).
