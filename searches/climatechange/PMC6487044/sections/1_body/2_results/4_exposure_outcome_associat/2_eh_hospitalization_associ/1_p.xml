<p id="Par60" class="p">Based on a statewide, all-ages RR of 1.31 for the risk of renal hospitalizations during EH days ≥32.2 °C vs. non-EH days among non-whites, we estimated an AF of 0.24 among non-whites less than 65 years of age. Among individuals 65 years and older, we estimated ZIP-code-specific AFs EH days ≥32.2 °C ranging as high as 0.63, among blacks 78 and older. Thirty-one percent of the 52 ZIP codes with AFs greater than 0.3 in any age-race group were in Wayne County, MI.</p>
