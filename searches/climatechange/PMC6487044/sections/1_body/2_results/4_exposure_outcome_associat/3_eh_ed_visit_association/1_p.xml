<p id="Par61" class="p">Based on the RRs presented in Kingsley et al. for non-accidental ED visits, we estimated AFs for EH days 32.2–34.9 °C of 0.042 and 0.071 for the 0–18 and 65 and older age groups, respectively. For EH days ≥35 °C, we estimated slightly higher AFs of 0.052 and 0.088 for the two respective age groups. For heat-related visits in the 18–64 age group, the AFs were much higher: 0.61 and 0.69 for EH days 32.2–34.9 °C and EH days ≥35 °C, respectively.</p>
