<p id="Par58" class="p">We did not see a significant association between either EH threshold (32.2–34.9, ≥35
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> C) and mortality in the 0–4 or 5–19 age groups (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Appendix 4, Table A2). Among men ages 20–54, we found a risk of mortality 1.12 (1.01–1.25) times that of women during ≥35
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> C EH days, and we found an added risk of mortality among individuals without a high school degree in this age group, as well. Among individuals 55–64, we found a 1.07 (1.00–1.14) risk of mortality during ≥35
 <sup class="sup">o</sup> C EH vs. non-EH (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Appendix 4, Table A2), but we did not find significant effect modification by any of the individual or area-level characteristics tested. Among individuals ages 65 and older, we found similar risks within 10-year age groups, so these were combined as in Gronlund et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. In this age group, we found added risks among non-married individuals, and increased risk with increasing non-green space and increasing poverty at the ZIP-code level. We did not vary our AFs by marital status given that this characteristic varied little by ZIP code. Furthermore, we did not vary our AFs by non-green space given that similar land cover characteristics are used in deriving the historical and projected area-specific EH days. The increased vulnerability among residents of ZIP codes with high poverty rates was a different finding from Gronlund et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], perhaps because our EH definition was more extreme than that used in Gronlund et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>].
