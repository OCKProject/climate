<p id="Par72" class="p">Estimated mortality and morbidity impacts varied by population projection. The statewide EH-associated mortality rate estimated using the 2050 ICLUS A2 population estimates was 3% below that using the Woods &amp; Poole central-case scenario while the EH-associated ED visit and hospitalization rates were 50% and 44% higher, respectively, than those using the Woods &amp; Poole scenario. This suggests our estimates of future EH-attributable mortality are only mildly sensitive to assumptions about population growth and migration, but our morbidity estimates are moderately sensitive to population change assumptions.</p>
