<p id="Par79" class="p">Our uncertainty in the costs associated with the historical and projected outcomes was moderate to high. For the costs associated with EH-attributable mortality, we were limited in our lack of estimates of years-of-life-lost. The time series and case-crossover study designs, on which our estimates were based, cannot estimate by how many months or years the deaths were advanced. Our approach of using the reduced life expectancies among individuals who die of cardiovascular or respiratory diseases attempts to account for this, but uncertainty in the degree of mortality displacement remains high. Uncertainty in the cost of a life-year is also high, with a reported range of $65,000 to $490,000 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>], but we are uncertain as to how well the estimates reflected the cost of an EH-associated visit that was not necessarily coded as heat-related. Specifically, we used heat-related hospitalization costs to estimate EH-associated renal and respiratory hospitalizations, and we used non-accidental ED visit costs to estimate ED visits that were presumably triggered by EH.
