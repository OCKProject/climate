<p id="Par77" class="p">For EP, several studies of the association between precipitation and gastrointestinal illness did not find evidence of an association [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Jagai et al. may have been able to detect this association because they stratified their analysis by CSO exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. Additionally, in estimating the burden of disease, we applied RRs derived from a study defining EP at the 99th percentile of daily precipitation to exposure estimates of EP defined at the 98th percentile of daily precipitation, which might slightly overestimate the burden.
