<p id="Par75" class="p">Several recent studies have found a substantial decrease in the association between EH and mortality over time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>], suggesting strong technological and/or behavioral adaptation to EH. Nordio et al. found a decrease in the RR for mortality at 27 °C vs. 16 °C for the climate region containing Michigan, from 1.25 in the 1962–1966 time period to 1.08 in the 2000–2006 time period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. Likewise, Bobb et al. found that excess deaths per 1000 deaths attributable to each 5.6 °C increase in summer temperature declined from 50 per 1000 in 1987 to 11 per 1000 in 2005 in the Industrial Midwest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. In New York City, in a climate similar to that of Michigan’s, Petkova et al. found a decline in RR for mortality at 29 °C vs. 22 °C over 11 decades, from 1.43 in the 1900s to 1.09 in the 2000s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>]. Although all of these studies show a leveling off of this decline in recent years, changes in the RRs or attributable deaths over time of 60–80% for the mortality outcomes suggest that change over time for all of the exposure-response associations remains a source of moderate uncertainty.
