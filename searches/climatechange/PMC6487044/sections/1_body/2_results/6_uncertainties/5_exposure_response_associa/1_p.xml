<p id="Par74" class="p">Another large source of uncertainty is in our estimate of the RRs. For the EH-hospitalization estimate among individuals under 65 years of age, the 95% confidence intervals ranged from ±80% around the point estimate. Among individuals 65 and older, the 95% confidence interval for the median RR estimate (1.13) of hospitalization ranged from ±40% around the point estimate. For the EH-mortality estimates, for which we had a large Michigan-specific data set, the 95% confidence intervals around the RRs corresponded to increases of more than 100% or decreases of close to 100% in the AFs. For the EH-ED associations, the 95% confidence intervals ranged as high as 52% above the point estimate. Additionally, the cumulative effects in the days following the exposure, i.e., the lagged effects, were not estimated in the EH-ED source study, further contributing to uncertainty in the net effect of EH on ED visits.</p>
