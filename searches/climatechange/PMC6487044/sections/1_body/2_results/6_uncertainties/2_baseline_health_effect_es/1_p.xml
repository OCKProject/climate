<p id="Par70" class="p">For the historical estimates, our uncertainty in the baseline mortality estimates is low given that over 99% of deaths in the U.S. are thought to be registered [

Despite not having county-specific historical hospitalization data for our study, our estimate of uncertainty in hospitalization rates by race and age is also low, given that over 50% of the stateâ€™s black population lives in the counties for which we had detailed warm-season hospitalization rates by race and cause. Furthermore, the all-cause renal hospitalization rate in the 3 counties of 12.2% in 2014 is very close to the statewide rate of 12.5% [

In comparing statewide rates among the Midwest states for which data were available, we found a maximum absolute percent difference around the Midwest estimate for the heat-related ED visits of 57%, giving us moderate uncertainty in our baseline ED-visit-rate estimates (Additional file
