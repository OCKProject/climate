<p id="Par73" class="p">A large source of uncertainty is that in the climate projections. The bias in number of days with maximum temperature &gt; 32.2 °C for the A2 scenario from the six GCMs that were used to generate the Michigan-specific projections range ranged from − 50% to + 20% in Michigan. For EP, bias in wet days with &gt; 3 in. of precipitation, the A2 scenario-specific biases range from − 90% to 100% in Michigan, depending on the GCM and the region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. Therefore, projections of increases could reasonably range from almost no increase in EP days to twice as many days as projected by the ensemble climate projection. Global and downscaled climate projections may contain additional biases not quantified above, especially near the Great Lakes region. The spatial resolution of GCMs does not allow for accurate representation of the lakes’ influence on local and regional climate; at best, GCMs may capture the large-scale regional effects of the lakes [

With regards to historical EP exposure estimates, those used in deriving the precipitation exposure-response association were from single monitors rather than modeled data with high spatial resolution. Given the spatially heterogeneous nature of precipitation, this may result in bias of the effect estimates towards the null, as was demonstrated in a recent simulation study of precipitation health effects [
