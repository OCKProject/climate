<p id="Par52" class="p">People may be exposed to pathogens in contaminated surface water by ingestion, inhalation or dermal contact. These exposures may be due to 1) inadequate treatment at the water treatment plant, 2) contamination of drinking water in the treated water delivery system or 3) direct contact with contaminated surface water. Flooding, in particular, may contribute to human exposure of contaminated surface water via pathways (2) and (3) [
