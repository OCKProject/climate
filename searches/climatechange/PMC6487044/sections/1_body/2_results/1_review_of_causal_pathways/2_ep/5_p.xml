 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>]. Almost 100,000 Michigan residents use public water systems with intakes in Lake Erie. The potential health effects of HABs in these cities are of concern given that current water treatment methods do not remove all of the toxins produced by the cyanobacteria. Emergency response plans addressing a HAB, including bottled water distribution, have been put in place [
