 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>]. EP events can increase the turbidity in surface water. However, all drinking water treatment plants in Michigan actively reduce levels of turbidity when processing raw water into finished drinking water. Studies of associations between gastrointestinal illness and turbidity, at levels as low as those measured in U.S. drinking water systems, have shown mixed results. Studies in Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Atlanta, New York City, Vancouver, and Quebec each found associations between turbidity, as measured at the treatment plant, and GI illness in subsets of age groups, subsets of seasons and/or subsets of days following the elevated turbidity, [
