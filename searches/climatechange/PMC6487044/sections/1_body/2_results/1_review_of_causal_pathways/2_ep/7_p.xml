 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>] investigated the risk of GI illness among participants of a pre-existing drinking water intervention study. The incidence rate ratio for GI symptoms during the flood vs. prior to the flood was 1.29 (95% CI: 1.06–1.58), with an increased effect among individuals with increased sensitivity to GI illness. GI symptoms were also associated with floodwater contact, particularly in children. In a case-crossover study of 129 floods in Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007, Wade et al. [
