<p id="Par45" class="p">Multiple pathways between EP and health may exist, although we did not find sufficient quantitative estimates of EP and health for the majority of these pathways to sufficiently characterize the health effects in our quantitative burden of disease estimates. Therefore, we describe these pathways in detail below. EP leads to contamination of surface water by increasing turbidity, by increasing the chances of harmful algal blooms, which are fed by agricultural run-off, and by prompting combined sewer overflows (CSOs). EP may also contaminate surface water when EP leads to flooding and flood waters wash contaminants into the surface water body.</p>
