<p id="Par44" class="p">As part of the Climate and Health Profile Report, several direct and indirect health impacts related to EH and EP were identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>]. Pathways by which EH affects health are direct and have been reviewed elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Briefly, mortality due to non-accidental causes was chosen as an indicator of disease burden for this analysis due to its known direct and immediate association with EH events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Non-accidental-cause ED visits and renal, respiratory and heat-related hospitalizations were chosen to best reflect the impact of EH on a wide variety of chronic diseases. Previous studies have shown associations between EH events and non-accidental-cause ED visits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>] and between EH and renal, respiratory and heat hospitalizations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Therefore, we included non-accidental cause mortality; renal, respiratory, and heat-related hospitalizations; and non-accidental ED visits in our EH burden of disease estimates, using studies that included Michigan and provided region-specific results, where possible, and from similar climates otherwise.
