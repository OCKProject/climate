<p id="Par82" class="p">These estimates represent the total non-accidental effects of EH as identified in the Michigan-specific causal pathway, including effects which may be mediated by ozone. It is not likely that ozone strongly mediates the EH-mortality or EH-hospitalization effects given that its inclusion in models of the association between EH and mortality and hospitalizations in Michigan did not affect the estimates of the EH effects by more than 10% [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. We did not have projected increases in ozone concentrations and could not estimate its projected direct effect, independent of EH. However, a projection of mortality in 2041–2050 due to ozone in 19 communities in the Southeastern U.S. found a small, 0.43 ppb increase in average ozone concentration due to climate change as compared to concentrations in 2000 and a concomitant 0.01% increase in the mortality rate attributable to climate-change related increases in ozone [
