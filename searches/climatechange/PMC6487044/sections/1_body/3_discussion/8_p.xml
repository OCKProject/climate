<p id="Par88" class="p">Several limitations to our estimates of the burden of future EH and EP exist, largely stemming from uncertainty surrounding various model inputs. The uncertainty analysis indicated that our mortality projections are only mildly sensitive to different population assumptions. Other inputs, including the exposure data and exposure-response function, carry greater uncertainty. A key limitation in our approach is the use of historical relationships for the estimation of future health effects without accounting for long-term adaptation to EH or EP. Physiological and behavioral adaptations have the potential to reduce the impact of extreme weather. Our results may therefore be regarded as a direr scenario where effective public health measures protecting individuals from extreme weather events have not been adopted.</p>
