<p id="Par86" class="p">We have only calculated the EP-attributable burden of GI illness related to ED visits. Most people experiencing GI illness do not seek treatment in EDs or medical care of any kind. Using a variety of surveillance systems, Mead et al. estimated that the average person experiences 1.05 episodes of GI illness annually characterized by diarrhea, vomiting or both [

Furthermore, our quantitative EP estimate may not have accounted for the effects of harmful algal blooms, which may affect Michigan and Massachusetts drinking water delivery systems differently.
