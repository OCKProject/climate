<p id="Par89" class="p">Additionally, our analysis does not fully account for uncertainty in climate models or future climate conditions. Our projections of EH days were derived using the high emissions A2 scenario, although the lower emissions scenarios are becoming statistically improbable given recent historic emissions trends [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">101</xref>]. Incorporating exposure projections derived from alternate, low emissions scenarios would likely result in lower mortality estimates. On the other hand, evidence from other studies suggests that mortality and morbidity increase at less extreme temperatures in temperate climates such as Michigan [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. This would imply that our results underestimate the total number of deaths and ED visits associated with this climate scenario.
