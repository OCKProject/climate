<p id="Par81" class="p">The health burden due to EH and EP may significantly rise for all Michigan counties by midcentury, with the greatest mortality and ED-burden in the southeast. To provide a sense of the public health significance of our projections, the projected combined EH- and EP-attributable ED burden in Southeast Michigan, as high as 0.97/1000 persons, is not as high as the 2012â€“2013 national motor-vehicle accident ED visit rate of 10/1000 persons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">72</xref>], but it is comparable to the 2014 national ED-visit rate for miscarriages of 1.2/1000 persons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>]. Adaptation measures against extreme temperatures are needed to protect health, such as targeted public health monitoring, expanded access to air conditioning, and reductions in the urban heat island effect. Health protection of older adults should be prioritized in public health planning given the large burden among those aged 65 and older.
