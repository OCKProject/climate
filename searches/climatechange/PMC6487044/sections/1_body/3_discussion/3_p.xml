<p id="Par83" class="p">In addition to potential increases in ozone, some of the historical and projected ED visits which we attributed to EH may be among individuals experiencing asthma exacerbations. Several studies have found associations between temperature and asthma symptoms or ED visits. Winquist et al. found a 6% increase in the risk of ED visits for asthma among children in Atlanta at the 75th vs. 25th percentile of daily maximum temperature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>], and pediatric ED visits for chronic lower respiratory diseases increased in association with high temperatures in a separate study in Brisbane, Australia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">80</xref>]. We did not quantify the specific morbidity burden of asthma attributable to EH, but given the high prevalence of asthma in the State of Michigan [
