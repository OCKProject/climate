<p id="Par90" class="p">Under a dire climate change scenario, we estimated a Michigan-wide increase in EH-associated mortality from 0.46/100,000 persons historically to 2.9/100,000 in the projected period for $280 million in costs. We estimated a more substantial increase in EH-associated ED visits from 12/100,000 persons to 68/100,000 persons, for 7800 EH-attributable emergency department visits and $14 million in costs. EP-associated ED visits increased minimally from 1.7 to 1.9/100,000 persons, although this quantitative estimate did not include self-treated gastroenteritis or sufficiently represent the range of health problems from harmful algal blooms, flooding, and legionellosis. With the use of a high-emissions climate scenario and the exclusion of adaptation in the model we may over-estimate the future burden due to extreme temperatures in Michigan, but the exclusion of health effects from moderate heat, pollen, and precipitation-associated respiratory effects as well as any non-emergent health effects may result in substantial underestimation of both the present and future burden of climate in Michigan. Further research should investigate the association between moderate heat, precipitation, pollen, and health to gain a more complete picture of Michiganâ€™s climate-related disease burden. Our finding of a notable burden of mortality and morbidity attributable to EH, without assumptions about adaptation, stresses the importance of actions to protect health against the adverse health effects of EH. Additionally, although the uncertainty in the GI-illness projections is high, the health risks of poor public drinking water quality that can result from harmful algal blooms and storm-related emergencies are clear. In these emergencies, access to clean water for drinking and bathing can become challenges, and preparations for increases in EP events should focus on distribution of clean, potable water in emergencies to affected residents to avoid waterborne illnesses.</p>
