<p class="p">LHT represents an evolutionary framework for explaining the demographic and consumption patterns driving anthropogenic climate change. Patterns of global carbon emissions are the partial product of human life histories, themselves a response to local selection environments. LHT helps us to identify forces, both external (e.g. risk) and internal (e.g. psychology), that interact within local environments to shape reproduction strategies. Thus, LHT can provide an account of climate change grounded in human evolution. Our current results suggest that while both

 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-selected strategies can lead to higher carbon emissions, future orientation may mitigate expected carbon emissions through lowering fertility and interacting with parental investment, particularly in the context of higher education. Nevertheless, evidence for fertility rate increases in countries with the highest levels of development [
