Conversely, we expect that ‘future orientation’ is a phenotypic property of individuals in low mortality, low fertility, high parental investment environments, where planning and long-term goals influence differential fitness. Paradoxically, future orientation and associated LH regimes entail externalities, such as carbon emissions, that contribute to environmental uncertainty. Are there any conditions under which investment in embodied capital can proceed with fewer unintended costs? Using data from 67 000 women across 75 countries, we examine associations between future orientation and carbon emissions in different LH and development regimes (high income versus low income).
