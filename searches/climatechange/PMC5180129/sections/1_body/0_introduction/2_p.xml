<p class="p">Relationships between patterns of human fertility and anthropogenic climate change deserve more attention [

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Population growth in the next half-century could raise global carbon emissions by half, even with the unlikely assumption of no 
 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> increases in emissions [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Among mammals, 
 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> energy consumption is generally negatively associated with fertility [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. In humans, however, carbon emissions are positively associated with fertility rate increases 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> decreases depending on the development context [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. We suggest that parental investment and life-history theory (LHT) may be relevant for understanding fertility effects on anthropogenic climate change. Parental investment in embodied capital that theoretically targets ‘dynastic fitness’ in industrial labour markets [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] results in large 
 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> energy investments [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] with potentially large corresponding carbon emissions that reduce global carrying capacity and long-term sustainability and survival probabilities. Early LHT distinguished between 
 <italic class="italic">r-</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-strategies, relevant to density-dependent evolutionary dynamics (see [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]). 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> in our analysis refers to human ‘niche construction’ [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>] effects (e.g. unsustainable energy use) that reduce global carrying capacity as an externality associated with high investments in embodied capital [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Similarly, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> in our analysis characterizes nations with high fertility contributing to global population growth headed towards a shrinking 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. We wonder if human life history (LH) perception can be tuned to anticipate impending global density-dependent shocks [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>].
