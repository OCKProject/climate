Extrinsic risk refers to relatively less-predictable hazards (e.g. civil war, extreme weather, some epidemics), such that an organism is unable to alter survival probabilities through allocation of effort, both for themselves and their offspring. High extrinsic risk favours 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>-strategies to ‘beat the odds’ that a parent dies before reproduction or leaves relatively few offspring given high juvenile mortality. In low risk environments, differential reproductive success is more contingent upon somatic (embodied) investment, thereby favouring

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Evidence that extrinsic risk impacts fertility has been shown across a range of human societies (i.e. subsistence type, development stage) [

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], although it appears that the trend towards increasing
