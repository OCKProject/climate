<p class="p">Phenotypic effects of risk should be apparent in a suite of psychological and cultural traits that motivate behaviour towards investment in

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Time orientation reflects the degree to which focus on the past, present or future guides attitudes and behaviours [
 <xref rid="RSOS160470C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Present oriented individuals and cultures tend to focus on the current environment, seek out immediate pay-offs and are more likely to exhibit risky attitudes and behaviours [

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. Future orientation allows one to ‘transcend’ stimuli in the present and delay gratification, particularly towards fulfilment of future goals (e.g. education) [

 <xref rid="RSOS160470C49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Given these relationships, we predict present orientation will be associated with high extrinsic risk environments and investment in 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>-strategies while future orientation will be associated with low risk and investment in 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-strategies.
