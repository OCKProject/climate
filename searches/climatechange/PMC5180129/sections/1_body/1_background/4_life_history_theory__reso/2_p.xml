<p class="p">Parental investment considerations complicate solutions for anthropogenic climate change. Efforts to decrease extrinsic risk in low-income countries, while reducing demographic-linked emissions, would likely be offset by subsequent 
 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> parental investment increases with substantial carbon by-products. To reduce emissions, embodied and parental effort must be channelled towards more ‘carbon-friendly’ energy investment patterns. We question whether the more future-oriented psychologies emerging from low risk environments would allow for attention to long-term environmental catastrophe as a salient cue for parental investment. We view future orientation as an adaptive psychological response that emerges with a suite of 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-strategies associated with industrialization/development. We wish to examine the possibility that psychological processes can be co-opted to promote more efficient energy use, providing insight for carbon emissions. Future orientation, when paired with investment in higher education, might promote behaviours that attenuate the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">per capita</italic> somatic and parental investment and carbon emissions. Future orientation might be co-opted to encourage investment in education designed to tune perception to long-term environmental impacts.
