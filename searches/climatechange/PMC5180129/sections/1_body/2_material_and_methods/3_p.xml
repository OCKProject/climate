<p class="p">Country-level effects of FO were assessed through specifying an

 <italic class="italic">T</italic> is commonly represented by entering two variables into models, the percentage of GDP produced from the manufacturing sector and percentage of GDP produced from the service sector. Percentage enrolment in post-secondary education was used to represent investment in higher education. Variables were log-transformed prior to analysis, consistent with other
