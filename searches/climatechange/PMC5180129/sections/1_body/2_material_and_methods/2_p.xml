Extrinsic risk was represented by the average life expectancy at birth (LEB) in the 10 years after a person was born. While LEB is a national average, we include it as an individual attribute given we use a person's age to determine LEB. Education level (EDU) was coded none, primary, secondary and post-secondary. Future orientation was a country-level indicator and represented by Hoftstede's [
