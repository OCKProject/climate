<p class="p">TFR was 3.126 births when LEB and EDU were at their within-country mean and FO was at its between-country mean (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="RSOS160470TB1" class="xref">table 1</xref>). Controlling for the other predictors, a 1-year increase in LEB was associated with a 0.0075 birth decrease, and a one-unit increase in EDU (e.g. none to primary) was associated with a 0.637 birth decrease. A one-unit increase in future orientation was associated with a 0.032 birth decrease. Cross-level interactions between FO and EDU and FO and LEB were significant and are graphed in

 <sub class="sub">03</sub> = −0.249) meaning that in countries with higher TFRs (i.e. higher intercepts), the slope of the relationship between EDU and TFR is smaller and the relationship between EDU and TFR weaker.
