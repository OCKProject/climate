<p class="p">Emissions from high-income countries will continue to comprise the majority of global carbon output and so it is these countries who are, and will be, responsible for increases in global risk levels. Yet, it is low-income countries who are, and will be, most impacted by these risks (e.g. extreme weather, civil unrest) [

 <italic class="italic">r</italic>-strategies (including less future orientations) point to a catastrophic possibility—rapid population growth within those countries where growth has the largest impact on carbon emissions. To short-circuit feedback loops between population growth in low-income countries and unsustainable investment in high-income countries, future research should determine how future orientation and education can be leveraged to slow the global march towards earth's carrying capacity. Promising areas include studies providing evidence that future orientations can be ‘taught’ within the classroom [
