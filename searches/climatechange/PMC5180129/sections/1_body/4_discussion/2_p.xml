<p class="p">LHT provides insight into the demographic and consumption dynamics driving global carbon emissions. Life-history components of 
 <italic class="italic">K-</italic>strategies, including low mortality, high investment and future orientation, are negatively correlated with TFRs across 67 000 women and 75 countries. Furthermore, future orientation appears to significantly interact with risk and investment regimes. Differences in TFRs across education levels 
 <italic class="italic">diminished</italic> as countries became more future oriented, suggesting that education, at any level, was associated with longer delays in reproduction and higher embodied and parental investment within future-oriented countries (

 <italic class="italic">a</italic>). As future orientation increased, the greater rate of decline in predicted TFRs at high risk levels (

 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) resulted in a crossover interaction where high risk environments actually predicted lower fertility than low risk environments. This result, seemingly inconsistent with LHT, demonstrates the importance of including time orientation in investigations of how human LHs respond to local risk environments.
