<p id="Par5" class="p">ENM is based on the concept of the ecological niche, which associates a set of environmental variables to the ability of a species to persist in an environment, and is related to the fitness of a species

 </sup>. These environmental variables (e.g. climate, soil moisture and nutrients, etc.) constrain the distribution and abundance of a species
