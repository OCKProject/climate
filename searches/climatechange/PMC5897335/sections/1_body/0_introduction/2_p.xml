<p id="Par3" class="p">The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is the highest alpine ecosystem in the world, and perhaps one of the most sensitive to climate change. The temperature increase in the QTP has been faster than the mean temperature increases in the Northern Hemisphere as well as in other regions at the same latitude

 </sup>. Recent phylogeography studies of QTP plants reveal that Quaternary glaciations, especially the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 22,000 years before present (BP)), have profoundly influenced the distributions of these species
