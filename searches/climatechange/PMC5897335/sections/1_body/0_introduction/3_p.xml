 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> is a perennial herb genus comprising nearly 70 species, which are primarily distributed in the QTP and neighboring mountains

 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> originated in the QTP about 21.0 Mya and rapidly diversified beginning 12.1 Mya coincident with the uplift of the QTP

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>

 <italic class="italic">R. rosea</italic>) dispersing to other parts of the globe

 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species are adapted to low temperatures, making them an ideal model for investigating the response of montane herbaceous species to climate change. To date, the genealogical patterns of three

 <italic class="italic">R. alsia</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">R. dumulosa</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">R. kirilowii</italic>) of the QTP have been investigated

 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> distributions have been highly influenced by the LGM temperature where they expanded from refugia in the southeastern QTP and HM

 </sup>. A limitation of these studies is that they do not utilize ecological niche modelling (ENM) with their molecular data, and thus exhibit only a cursory understanding of how changing environments might have shaped contemporary distributions and phylogeographic patterns.
