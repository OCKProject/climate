<p id="Par34" class="p">We created a python script (see Supplementary Material2) to calculate the predicted suitable area, mean elevation, and mean center of the predicted distribution in ArcGIS for each model based on 25% habitat suitability. The predicted suitable area was calculated using rectangular projections. We calculated the mean elevation of each suitable area in meters, and found the mean center of the suitable area by calculating the mean longitude and latitude (for python script see Supplementary Material2).</p>
