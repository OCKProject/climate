<p id="Par32" class="p">For the MEAN ENSEMBLE and MMM ENSEMBLE approaches, we undertook a three-step process in the BiodiversityR package
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup> to prepare for consensus mapping for each species and species group. The first step involved calibration of niche modelling algorithms, applying the ‘ensemble.test.splits’ function where we calibrated 17 ENM sub-models and defined a 4-fold cross-validation using 75% of the data to evaluate the remaining 25% data. AUC values for sub-models were used to determine their weights for ensemble models (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. For the second step we applied the “ensemble.test” function with sub-model weights &gt;0.05 retained for ensemble modelling (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S16</xref>) – this used 10 internal test runs and 4-fold cross-validations predicting final weights for the sub-models. The last step was “ensemble.raster” function, which generated our consensus mapping. Upon completion of our MEAN ENSEMBLE models, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of all predictions.
