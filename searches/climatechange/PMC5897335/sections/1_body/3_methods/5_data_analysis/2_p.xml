 </sup>, with higher gain indicating a variable that contributes highly to the species’ spatial distribution. For a better understanding of the contributions of temperature and precipitation variables to the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species, we first performed separate Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on the four temperature variables and five precipitation variables using records for all species (WHOLE)

 </sup>. These ordinations produced two major temperature axes (Temp1 and Temp2) and two major precipitation axes (Prec1 and Prec2). To further reduce the dimensionality of the PCA data, we then used the scores of PC axes to do canonical discriminants analysis (CDA) (considering both temperature variables and precipitation variables) for G
