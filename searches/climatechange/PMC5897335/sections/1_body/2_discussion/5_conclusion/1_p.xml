<p id="Par26" class="p">Our study revealed that 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species were primarily confined to the HM during the LIG, and then expanded into the southeastern QTP during LGM. From the LGM to the present day our results thus indicate that most species expanded to inhabit much broader geographic ranges on the QTP and adjacent regions concomitant with climate warming. These results together imply that high elevation regions in the southeastern QTP and HM were the center of origin and radiation for 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic>, and the location of refugia. Our analyses suggested that many 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species will not show diminished range sizes under future climate warning as would be predicted by the “nowhere to go” scenario hypothesis. This in part could be because diminution of permafrost at higher altitudes could create large swaths of new, suitable habitat. However, distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species were projected to show both latitudinal and elevational shifts. Finally, our analyses indicated that species with similar ecological niche requirements will respond similarly to climate change.
