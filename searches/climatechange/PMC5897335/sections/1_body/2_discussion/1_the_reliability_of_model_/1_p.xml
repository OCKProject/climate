 </sup>, we used the multi-model mean of all the GCMs to do ENM (MMM ENSEMBLE), and also applied each GCM to do ENM (MEAN ENSEMBLE), and then calculated the mean and standard deviations for all predictions. The predictions of MEAN ENSEMBLE for the LGM and 2050 scenarios overlapped those of MMM ENSEMBLE, implying that modelling with the MMM of the GCMs was reasonable
