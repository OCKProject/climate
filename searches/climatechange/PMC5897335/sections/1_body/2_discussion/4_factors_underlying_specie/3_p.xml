<p id="Par24" class="p">Model performance was higher for groups than for the genus in its entirety (WHOLE) (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>), implying that classifications based on distribution patterns may yield more insights about habitat suitability and climate requirements. It was especially notable that the responses to climate change varied between lower versus higher elevation species. For instance, the suitable area available for low elevation 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species (G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub>) increased from the LIG to the LGM, and then decreased from the LGM to the current and future scenarios. This was in contrast to higher elevation taxa (e.g. G
 <sub class="sub">QTP</sub>) which were predicted to continue to increase from the LIG using Maxent (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). These findings together imply that even closely-related species might diverge in their responses to climate change because of niche differentiation
