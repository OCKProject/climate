<p id="Par23" class="p">Our ENM showed that, in comparison to precipitation, temperature-related variables are more important influencing factors to 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species distributions, implying that cold-adapted plants exhibit sensitivity to climate warming. Results from our PCA and CAD analyses suggested that divergence in ecological niches accounted for the different distribution patterns among 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Niche breadths of G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub> species were distinct from high elevation plants with the former showing broader distributions than the latter. Generally low elevation 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> taxa need relatively stable higher temperatures and more homogeneous precipitation throughout the year, whereas higher elevation species are adapted to relatively low temperature, larger diel and seasonal temperature differences and more heterogeneous, and sporadic precipitation. Among the high elevation taxa, the ranges of those within G
 <sub class="sub">HM</sub> had higher temperatures and summer precipitation levels than taxa within G
 <sub class="sub">QTP</sub> and G
 <sub class="sub">wide</sub>, with temperature appearing to be more important. The geographic ranges for species within our G
 <sub class="sub">wide</sub> group exhibited higher temperature stability than those in G
 <sub class="sub">QTP</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>).
