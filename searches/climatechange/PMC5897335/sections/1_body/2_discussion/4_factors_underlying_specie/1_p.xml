 </sup>. ENM is tacitly based on the assumption of niche conservation and is often used to estimate the influence of climate and other abiotic factors on species distributions; however, it can also be used to predict the effects of evolutionary history on species ranges (i.e. examining the evolutionary niche

 </sup>). Sister species and closely related species existing in sympatry should have distinct niches for them to coexist, and thus are expected to respond differently to climate change

 </sup>. In our study we did detect significantly different patterns of range shifting between sister species and related species within particular clades (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S13</xref>). This suggests that there is an effect of evolutionary history, consistent with the view that species diversity of
