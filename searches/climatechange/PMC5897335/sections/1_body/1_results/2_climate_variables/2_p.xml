<p id="Par9" class="p">The principal components analysis (PCA) of temperature variables generated two temperature axis (Temp1 and Temp2) that explained 55.6% and 32.1% (87.7% cumulatively) of the total variation in the temperature dataset. The PCA of precipitation variables produced two precipitation axis (Prec1 and Prec2) that explained 62.3% and 25.6% (87.8% cumulatively) of total variation in the precipitation dataset. BIO8 (Mean temperature of wettest quarter) and BIO9 (Mean temperature of the driest quarter) both had the largest loadings (contributions to the summed variance) for Temp 1 and were both positive. Mean Diurnal Range (BIO2) and Isothermality (BIO3) showed the highest loadings for Temp2 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Three precipitation variables, Precipitation of Driest Month (BIO14), Precipitation of Coldest Quarter (BIO19), and Precipitation Seasonality (BIO15) loaded highly on Prec1, with the former two loading positively and the last negatively, whereas both Precipitation of Wettest Month (BIO13) and Precipitation of Warmest Quarter (BIO18) had positive loadings on Prec2 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>).
