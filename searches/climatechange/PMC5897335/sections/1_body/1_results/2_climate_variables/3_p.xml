<p id="Par10" class="p">The canonical discriminant analysis (CDA) using Temp1, Temp2, Prec1 and Prec2 produced three discriminant functions, the first explained 76.9% among-group climatic variance, the second 20.1% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The third explained the remaining 3% of the total variance, suggesting that it could be neglected in subsequent analysis. Of the four variables, Temp2 contributed the most to the first discriminant function, while Temp1 contributed most to the second (Supplementary Table
