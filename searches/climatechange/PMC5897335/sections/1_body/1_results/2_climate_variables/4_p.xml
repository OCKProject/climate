<p id="Par11" class="p">The Wilks’ Lambda value for each CDA axis was significant at α = 0.05, suggesting that at least some of the 14 focal species occupied geographic ranges that were climatically distinguishable. The first discriminant function best separated G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub> and G
 <sub class="sub">QTP</sub> from other groups (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). Specifically, G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub> had the lowest first discriminant function corresponding to lower Mean Diurnal Range (BIO2) and Isothermality (BIO3), whereas G
 <sub class="sub">QTP</sub> had the highest first discriminant function relating to highest Mean Diurnal Range (BIO2) and Isothermality (BIO3). For G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub> and G
 <sub class="sub">HM</sub> the second discriminant function distinctly separated these groups from others. G
 <sub class="sub">HM</sub> individuals tended to score highest on the second discriminant axis, while G
 <sub class="sub">plain</sub> individuals tended to have intermediate scores, where these two groups had higher values for Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter (BIO8) and Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter (BIO9).
