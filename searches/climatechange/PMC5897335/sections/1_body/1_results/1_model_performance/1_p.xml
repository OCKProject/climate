<p id="Par7" class="p">We used three modelling approaches to predict the distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species: (1) MEAN ENSEMBLE: using each Global Climate Model (GCM, one GCM for LIG and current, 4 GCMs for LGM, and 17GCMs for 2050, respectively) to do ensemble ENM, and then calculated the mean and standard deviation of all predictions; (2) MMM ENSEMBLE: using the multi-model mean (MMM) of all the GCMs to do ensemble ENM; (3) The maximum entropy algorithm, Maxent: using the MMM of all the GCMs to do Maxent modelling. The Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC) of ensemble models (MEAN ENSEMBLE and MMM ENSEMBLE) ranged from 0.968 to 0.995 for individual species with our designated groups (clade, distribution and breeding system) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) showing high performance. Maxent also showed good performance in modelling the distributions of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species: the AUC values ranged from 0.925 to 0.993 and True Skill Statistic (TSS) values from 0.902 to 0.993, both statistics being significantly higher than would be expected at random (all p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Similarly, all training omission (OR) values in Maxent were significantly lower than random predictions (all p &lt; 0.0001, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Comparisons of model AUC values for the genus as a whole (WHOLE, 14 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species), for each species group, and for constituent species of each species group revealed no significant differences (for all, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05, Wilcoxon rank sum test), indicating that all three modelling approaches performed well irrespective of the grouping.
