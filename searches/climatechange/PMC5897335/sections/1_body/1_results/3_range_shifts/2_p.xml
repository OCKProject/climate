<p id="Par13" class="p">Between the LIG and LGM, the predictions of MEAN ENSEMBLE and MMM ENSEMBLE indicated no significant range shifts for any species or species group (the values of ΔS1 were near to zero), whereas the results from Maxent showed that most species would have expanded their respective ranges (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9</xref>), migrating to lower elevations (Table
