<p id="Par15" class="p">Extrapolating from our findings for the future climate warming scenario, the mean upward rate of elevational shifting for 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species would be ca. 0.273 (±0.217) m/year, 0.495 (±0.521) m/year and 7.07 (±5.42) m/year estimated using MEAN ENSEMBLE, MMM ENSEMBLE and Maxent, respectively. The three modelling approaches predicted that the mean northward rate of range movement should be ca. 0.288 (±0.288) km/year, 0.384 (±0.192) km/year and 1.24 (±1.19) km/year for (estimated by 1 degree equals 111 × cos30 km, at about 30° latitude). Maxent had relatively higher predictions than the other approaches. In contrast, some species displayed southward movement, including
