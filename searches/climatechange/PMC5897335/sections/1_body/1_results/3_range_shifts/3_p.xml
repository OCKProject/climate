 <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species are predicted to expand their ranges in MEAN ENSEMBLE, MMM ENSEMBLE, and Maxent, with the remaining species predicted to exhibit range contractions; this was especially evident for

In addition, we found that ranges were projected to shift more extensively (two or three orders of magnitude) between the current and future scenarios compared to between the LGM to current time points (Supplementary Tables
