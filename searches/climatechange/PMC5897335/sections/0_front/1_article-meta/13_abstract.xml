 <p id="Par1" class="p">Climate change profoundly influences species distributions. These effects are evident in poleward latitudinal range shifts for many taxa, and upward altitudinal range shifts for alpine species, that resulted from increased annual global temperatures since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ca. 22,000 BP). For the latter, the ultimate consequence of upward shifts may be extinction as species in the highest alpine ecosystems can migrate no further, a phenomenon often characterized as “nowhere to go”. To predict responses to climate change of the alpine plants on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP), we used ecological niche modelling (ENM) to estimate the range shifts of 14 
  <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species, beginning with the Last Interglacial (ca. 120,000–140,000 BP) through to 2050. Distributions of 
  <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species appear to be shaped by temperature-related variables. The southeastern QTP, and especially the Hengduan Mountains, were the origin and center of distribution for 
  <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic>, and also served as refugia during the LGM. Under future climate scenario in 2050, 
  <italic class="italic">Rhodiola</italic> species might have to migrate upward and northward, but many species would expand their ranges contra the prediction of the “nowhere to go” hypothesis, caused by the appearance of additional potential habitat concomitant with the reduction of permafrost with climate warming.
