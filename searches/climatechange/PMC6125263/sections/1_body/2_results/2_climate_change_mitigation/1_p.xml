<p id="Par17" class="p">Time series of the mitigation potential showed that ranking of the activities could change over time, and that substitution benefits had considerable impact on the 2050 ranking (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, see Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Figure S3 in Additional materials for 2030 rankings). For all scenarios involving changes in forest management activity, the emissions were reduced relative to the baseline because of reduced emissions from decay and slashburning (
 <italic class="italic">Higher Utilization, Residues for Bioenergy, No Slashburning</italic>) or enhanced removals and reduced emissions related to lower harvest levels (
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic>). Harvesting transfers C to HWP, which temporarily stores and then emits C at the end of the products’ lifetime through incineration and landfill decay. Higher HWP emissions were associated with scenarios that used more wood products (
 <italic class="italic">Higher Utilization</italic>), while reduced emissions were associated with the 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic> scenario (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Substitution benefits depend on the marginal change in avoided emissions, which is based on the change in the amount of wood commodities, and the displacement factors. In the 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic> scenario the reduction in commodities accrued fewer substitution benefits, relative to the baseline, more so when displacement factors were high, which offset the emissions reductions in the forest and HWP components.
