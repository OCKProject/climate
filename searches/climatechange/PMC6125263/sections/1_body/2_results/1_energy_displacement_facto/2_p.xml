<p id="Par16" class="p">The refined set of displacement factors considered the five communities within the Cranbrook FMU and their share of harvest residues based on cheapest transportation routes (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>). Energy demands were lower than the FMU average, and the average displacement factor was found to have a lower average value of 0.46 for the five communities, with a range of 0.23–0.66. For Dog River, transporting harvest residues to the nearby larger community of Thunder Bay (population 130 k) significantly increased the displacement factor from 0.38 to 1.0 because of the increased heat demand in that community and substitution of fuel oil. Average one-way transportation distances ranged from 31 to 65 km for the communities in the BC case study, and 76 km for Thunder Bay (Fig.
