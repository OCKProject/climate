<p id="Par15" class="p">Energy displacement factors were first estimated assuming provincial average fuel mix and energy consumption (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). The displacement factor for Cranbrook was relatively high (0.95) because of the population of 47 k people and their associated electricity and fossil-intensive heat demand. In contrast, the small population within the Dog River FMU had a low energy demand, and most of the harvest residues were converted to electricity that was used to displace low emissions grid electricity (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S3), resulting in a low displacement factor of 0.38.
