<p id="Par5" class="p">Climate change mitigation was defined as the potential for GHG emission reductions or removal increases relative to a baseline without mitigation actions. Our analysis included forest management scenarios that (i) maintained or increased stand-level C density through a reduction in harvest levels, and (ii) managed harvest residues to reduce slashburning, or used residues to create energy and solid wood products to displace the use of fossil-based energy sources or emissions-intensive products. The analysis also included a scenario that shifted the commodity mix of harvested wood products (HWP) towards longer-lived products.</p>
