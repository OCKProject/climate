 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], at the state level for Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>], at the provincial level for British Columbia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. However, in those spatially referenced analyses we were unable to identify community-level relevant options or estimate transportation distances associated with collection of harvest residue for bioenergy. In this analysis, the objective was to rank the impacts of climate change mitigation activities for two regions using spatially explicit forest inventories, harvest projections and road networks. We refined energy substitution impacts by using the cheapest transportation routes to determine harvest residue availability for each community and by using community-level baseline data on energy and the associated emissions profile. In GHG analyses such as this one, transportation distances are rarely included, or short haul transportation distances are assumed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. However, we include transportation distances because the location of the woody biomass feedstock relative to the nearest conversion facility plays a pivotal role in the economic feasibility of bioenergy production [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. The primary reason for the spatially explicit approach at the coarse resolution considered in these case studies was to better estimate the transportation distance, and other spatial aspects are not considered here.
