 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], and whether or not residues would have been slashburned or left to decay. In Dog River, which has less slashburning, the mitigation potential was driven more by the avoided fossil fuel emissions, particularly when residues were used in the nearby community of Thunder Bay. For the Cranbrook region, a greater enhancement was found in the forest component because of higher slashburning rates. The use of community-level data improved the quantification of substitution benefits by refining the displacement factors for specific timbershed regions. Future work could include the production of transportation biofuels for communities such as Fernie BC where stationary combustion had small substitution benefits. When the 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Residues for Bioenergy</italic> scenario was combined with the 
 <italic class="italic">Higher Utilization</italic> scenario, fewer residues were available for bioenergy because they were used for solid wood products. Using the residues for products instead of bioenergy in the combination strategy
