 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic> mitigation potential was limited because reduced emissions from harvesting less were offset over time by a lower C uptake rate due to less post-harvest regeneration and fewer substitution benefits. Therefore, this scenario highlighted the trade-off between maintaining or increasing C density and increasing the C uptake rate by fulfilling societal demand for biomass [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. We assumed that the small reduction in the production of pulp and paper would not have displacement impacts because consumers chose to use less of these products. We also assumed sawnwood and panels would be replaced by emissions-intensive products, rather than result in changes in harvesting and use of wood products from another region. Finally, we assumed that stands which were not harvested in this strategy would not be impacted by natural disturbances which could reverse the mitigation potential. Simulations with increased disturbance risk have found the increased burned area had negligible impacts on the mitigation potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] because harvest targets were applied to larger geographic regions where the model could shift harvest to other eligible stands and future harvests could be achieved regardless of increased future area burned. This conclusion is of course highly dependent on the fraction of Annual Allowable Cut that is actually harvested and the magnitude of increases in natural disturbances [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. Issues of leakage and risk of reversal of mitigation benefits (i.e. non-permanence) have been identified in earlier studies, but their impacts are difficult to project because these impacts are not usually included in mitigation analyses; in a review Buchholz et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>] found only 8 of 149 cases included leakage assessment, and non-permanence has more often been addressed in afforestation or reforestation projects [
