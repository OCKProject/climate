<p id="Par23" class="p">Comparing the two regions, there are differences in the mitigation potentials because harvest levels are different for the two regions, and the baseline parameters, scenario and scenario implementation levels also vary by region. For the 
 <italic class="italic">LLP</italic> scenario, the mitigation potential was higher in Cranbrook because this region had much higher harvest levels and produced more structural wood products. Similarly, the 
 <italic class="italic">Higher Utilization</italic> was higher for Cranbrook because of the higher harvest levels, and because the 5% increase in utilization was proportionally larger—the baseline utilization rate for Cranbrook assumed 85% of C in merchantable-sized trees was transferred to products in Cranbrook versus 90% in Dog River. The 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic> scenario had small mitigation benefits for both regions, with some differences between the two regions. Dog River had a higher implementation level for this scenario (5% reduction in harvest versus 2% reduction in Cranbrook), and a higher proportion of structural wood products (74.4% versus 61.8% in Cranbrook), which resulted in differences in the mitigation potential for the two regions (Fig.
