<p id="Par26" class="p">The use of harvest residues for local production of bioenergy was found to be effective, and we have included transportation distances associated with the transport of residue to nearby communities. A scenario that increased the harvest utilization level of merchantable-sized trees was also successful, and both of these scenarios included benefits from substituting for fossil fuels or emissions-intensive products. Combining forest management activities, such as higher utilization or bioenergy from harvest residues, with a wood-use scenario which generated more longer-lived products scenario had the highest mitigation potential. Refinements to substitution benefits have been included in this analysis, but there is still uncertainty in the substitution benefits and future research could focus on future policy directions (e.g. more use of wood in commercial and tall buildings, phase out of fuel oil for heating, reduced slash-pile burning, etc.). As projected future demand for biomass use in national GHG mitigation strategies could exceed sustainable biomass supply, analyses such as this can help identify biomass sources that achieve the greatest mitigation benefits.</p>
