<p id="Par25" class="p">Canadaâ€™s forests and forest products can contribute to mitigating climate change, and various mitigation options are available for forest management and wood-product use, with very large differences in mitigation benefits among the scenarios. The study includes impacts of mitigation activities on carbon stocks and fluxes in forest ecosystems, harvested wood products, and changes in emissions resulting from use of wood products instead of other emissions-intensive products and energy sources. Cumulative changes to 2050 relative to a baseline scenario are quantified.</p>
