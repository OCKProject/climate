 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. Both regions are roughly 1 Mha in size, mainly coniferous species with spatially explicit forest attributes (species, age, silvicultural intensity or site class) and associated merchantable yield tables. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> contains information on the forest inventory, anthropogenic and natural disturbances, and baseline energy usage. Transportation distances from harvest cutblocks to communities were estimated from networks of paved roads and unpaved forestry roads. If more than one community was present, the cheapest route from cutblock to community was selected assuming travel costs on paved roads were half the cost of travel on all other road types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Road networks were analyzed using ESRI Network Analyst (v 10.3.1) [
