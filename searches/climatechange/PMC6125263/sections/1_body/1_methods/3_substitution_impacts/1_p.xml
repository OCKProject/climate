<p id="Par12" class="p">Two substitution impacts were included: marginal substitution between solid wood products (sawnwood and panels) and emissions-intensive materials, and marginal substitution between bioenergy from harvest residues and fossil fuel based stationary combustion for power and heat. Displacement factors for solid wood products (DFp) (sawnwood and panels) were previously estimated for Canada assuming wood substituted for emissions-intensive products within a series of end-use products (e.g. single-family homes, furniture, etc.) and partitioning total avoided emissions into sawnwood and panels according to their share in total consumption. Displacement factors consider emissions associated with extraction, transportation of raw materials and manufacturing. Two sets of displacement factors were analyzed. The first set, based on a broad range of end-use products, was 0.54 and 0.45 tC emissions avoided per tC used for sawnwood and panels, respectively [

The second set of displacement factors assumed the wood products were used for building construction and substituted for steel and concrete, resulting in higher displacement factors of 2.1 tC/tC and 2.2 tC/tC for sawnwood and panels, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. These displacement factors included the production stage (extraction, transportation of raw materials, and manufacturing) and quantified from the change in emissions (for a set of more-wood products versus less-wood products) divided by the marginal change in wood C. Avoided emissions were estimated for a basket of end-use products and were weighted by Canadian consumption statistics to reflect national wood uses [
