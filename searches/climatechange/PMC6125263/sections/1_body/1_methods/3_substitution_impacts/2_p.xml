<p id="Par13" class="p">For avoided emissions for bioenergy, energy displacement factors (DFe) were estimated using a linear programming (LP) model that maximized avoided emissions by selecting from nine different candidate bioenergy facilities (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S2) to substitute for the most emissions-intensive baseline electricity and heat fuel sources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. In the first case, we assumed the energy demand was estimated by local population multiplied by a per capita energy use (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1a), and assuming the fuel mix was the same as that used in the Province [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. In the second case, we refined the displacement factors by including community-level energy demand and fuel mix in the BC case study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>], and by transporting residues across the FMU boundary to the adjacent community of Thunder Bay in the ON case study (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>: Table S1b). We assume that new bioenergy facilities would be constructed, and we do not include emissions associated with facility construction because we assume fossil energy sources would have similar construction or renovation emissions.
