<p id="Par14" class="p">Nine different individual and combination scenarios were assessed relative to the baseline, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>. The 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Less</italic> scenario reduced the harvest area 2–5 percentage points, which reduced the total amount of C transferred out of the ecosystem and the subsequent emissions from harvested wood products. However, fewer available wood products also reduces the substitution benefits. The 
 <italic class="italic">Higher Utilization</italic> scenario kept the harvest area unchanged but increased the average harvest utilization rate by 5% which increased the harvest volume per hectare and reduced the amount of harvest residues and their related emissions from decay and/or slashburning. The incremental harvest volume was assumed to be usable for the same mix of commodities as the original harvest. The 
 <italic class="italic">Harvest Residues for Bioenergy</italic> scenario maintained the harvest level and utilization rate of the baseline scenario, but reduced slashburning, and a portion of harvest residues (including branches, small trees, unused merchantable-sized trees and snags) was collected and transported to hypothetical bioenergy facilities to produce power and heat in place of using fossil fuels. The 
 <italic class="italic">No Slashburning</italic> scenario, implemented in Ontario only, stopped slashburning activities in the mitigation scenario, leaving residues to decay. In the baseline, a portion of harvest residues was slashburned, causing immediate emissions of both carbon dioxide but also more potent GHGs (methane and nitrous oxide) from the burning. The longer-lived products (LLP) scenario shifted 4% of the wood fibre use from pulp and paper to panels which extended the retention period of C in HWPs and accrued substitution benefits from the incremental production of panels. The 
 <italic class="italic">LLP</italic> scenario was combined with all forest management scenarios, discussed above, to quantify forest sector mitigation benefits.
