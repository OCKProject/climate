<p id="Par10" class="p">Our analysis was conducted at a spatial resolution of 16 ha, for two Forest Management Units (FMUs) identified in Canada’s 2016 National GHG Inventory Report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. An FMU is an administrative unit, based on a designated area established by a provincial or territorial government, for which harvesting activities are permitted for approved forest management plans. Annual allowable cut levels are defined for these regions, which specify the maximum amount of timber that can be harvested on a sustainable basis for each management area. Modeling assumptions for each FMU were based on a forecast of future harvest volumes and wildfires. Harvest projections were provided by provincial experts, and annual future wildfire was assumed to be the same as the historical (1990–2014) average annual area burned, which in both FMUs is very low (1.1 kha/year in Cranbrook, 520 ha/year in Dog River).
