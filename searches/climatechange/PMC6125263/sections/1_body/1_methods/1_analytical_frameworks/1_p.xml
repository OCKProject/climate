<p id="Par8" class="p">Our analysis considered mitigation potential to be reduced GHG emissions or enhanced C sequestration that would result from implementation of a mitigation option, relative to a baseline (IPCC, 2014). This approach assesses the potential climate change mitigation resulting from changes in forest management, the use of longer-lived products or bioenergy, and substitution impacts. We assume that all factors such as the potential impact of a changing climate or altered disturbance regimes have similar impacts on the baseline and a mitigation scenario, and thus do not contribute to changes in rankings of mitigation options. We defined forest sector mitigation based on C stock changes in the forest ecosystem and in HWPs. We used the IPCC Production Approach for estimating HWP C balances [
