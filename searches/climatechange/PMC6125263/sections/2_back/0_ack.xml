  <p id="Par27" class="p">This study was part of a tri-national research project on forest sector mitigation options in North America. We thank Karen Richardson and her colleagues at the Commission for Environmental Cooperation for the administration and coordination of research and the three North American Forest Services (Comisión Nacional Forestal, Canadian Forest Service, and US Forest Service) for support of this research. This study would not have been possible without cooperation from the British Columbia Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (Qinglin Li, Zach Xu and Caren Dymond) and the Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry (Michael Ter-Mikalian). However, the authors accept full responsibility for the assumptions made in this analysis. We thank Canadian Forest Service colleagues Max Fellows, Scott Morken, and Francesco Cortini for their contributions to the C modeling, and thank Simon Norris and Nick Warlsworth for their GIS support. We thank the editor and two anonymous reviewers for their comments and suggestions which have improved the manuscript.
