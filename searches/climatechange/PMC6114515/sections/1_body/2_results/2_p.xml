<p class="p">Conversion of pine plantations into natural pine forests and the conversion of eucalypt plantations into natural pine forest can partially mitigate climate-driven biodiversity loss, as natural pine forests usually maintain more bird species than planted ones, and pine forests maintain more species than eucalypt plantations. Nevertheless, the efficiency of the modelled naturalization effort was non-linear, but showed peak positive effects on regional bird richness when around 55% of plantations were transformed to natural pine forests under current climate conditions. Finally, the efficiency and the effort of the modelled naturalization was highly heterogeneous spatially, with higher expected success in the north and in mountains than in the southern lowlands (Figs
