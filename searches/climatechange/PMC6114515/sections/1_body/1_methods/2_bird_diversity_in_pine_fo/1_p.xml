<p class="p">We used long-term monitoring of the presence of breeding birds across Spain (particularly 3950 10x10-km cells of the Spanish Breeding Bird Atlas [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] to estimate forest biodiversity based on bird species richness [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], although we are aware that no single indicator could fully capture forest biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Presenceâ€”absence data on the subset of 44 species that are most likely to occupy pine forests (pine forest dwelling birds,) were referenced to the 10x10-km UTM grids throughout Spain. The list of the 44 pine forest dwelling birds was composed by the bird species present in cells where 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> spp. occupied more than 50% of the cell using the Spanish Forest Map (scale 1:50,000), as well as on the information of bird habitat requirements compiled in the bird atlas (see [
