 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Accordingly, we used climate information, including daily precipitation and the maximum and minimum temperatures corresponding to the period 1950–2000, directly obtained from AEMET (Agencia Estatal de Meteorología, Spain). We interpolated 1x1-km climate surfaces corresponding to the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual temperature by means of Thin Plate Splines (TPS) using elevation as the independent co-variable, as it was proposed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. We then used these surfaces to characterize our 10x10-km UTM grid cells by averaging the mean annual precipitation and the mean annual temperature values of all the 1x1 cells included in each grid. The forecasts for these bioclimatic variables representative of 2050 (average for 2041–2060) were obtained from nine of the most recent Global Climate Models (GCMs) used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report, from which we selected two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP), namely a medium emission scenario (RCP4.5) and a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). The GCMs were transformed to a local scale using the procedure proposed by [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. We therefore obtained a total of 18 different future climate scenarios (9 GCMs x 2 RCP). The expected bird diversity was estimated for each of these climate scenarios using the model defined in next section.
