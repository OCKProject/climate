 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Pine forests in the Mediterranean region are one of the forest systems most intensively managed [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>] and occupy a large territory in the Spanish Iberian Peninsula (around 8.5 million hectares in our sample). Five native pine species are distributed across an ecological gradient that ranges from arid lands to temperate forests in the Iberian Peninsula, in the southwestern Mediterranean. Pine forests on the Spanish Iberian Peninsula allow us to investigate the potential role played by forest naturalization on biodiversity at regional scales, and to investigate if naturalization could mitigate the expected diversity loss of forest birds driven by climate change.
