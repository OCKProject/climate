<p class="p">To characterize the study area, we estimated a comprehensive list of variables representing the effects of geography, orography, climate, land use, forest composition and structure, and the condition of “planted” versus “natural” with respect to bird diversity (defined by the species richness of pine forest dwelling birds ([

The sources used to collect the data were diverse: (1) digital elevation models to calculate orographic variables (25x25 m); (2) the Third Spanish Forest Inventory to characterize forest composition and structure (95,327 permanent sample plots stablished at the intersection of a 1x1 km UTM-grid [
