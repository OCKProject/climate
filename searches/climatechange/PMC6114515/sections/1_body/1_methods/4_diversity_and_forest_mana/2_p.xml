All variables used in the model to explain bird diversity were previously inspected to determine linear or curvilinear relationships with respect to the explanatory variable using generalized additive models (“mgcv” library in R 3.3.1), fitting a second-order polynomial transformation when necessary (

Main effects of geography, orography, climate, land use, forest composition and structure, the condition of “planted” versus “natural” and interactions between plantation origin, geographical coordinates, and climate variables were used as independent variables. Finally, to cope with multicollinearity issues, we generated a Spearman rank correlation matrix by selecting those variables that were not significantly correlated (rho &lt; |0.7|), and best described the dependent variable. We then calculated the Generalized Variance Inflation Factors (GVIF) for the final models (using the ‘‘car” library in R 3.1.2) to ensure that all GVIF values were below 2.5.
