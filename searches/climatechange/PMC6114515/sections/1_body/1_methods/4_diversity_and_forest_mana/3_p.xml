<p class="p">Once the predictive model was defined, we estimated bird diversity under the uncertainty of different climate scenarios (18 different future climate scenarios explained above) and different naturalization efforts (101 scenarios where the naturalization restriction figure goes from 0% to 100% in every 10x10-km UTM grid cell by an increment of 1% of naturalization). We added a further set of scenarios where the entire surface area occupied by
