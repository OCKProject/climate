<p class="p">The naturalization of forests within the context of this study is defined as a two-step management action. First, current pine plantations, defined as such on the basis of the well-known genetic and historical regions of provenance of pine forests [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], were converted into natural pine forests with other variables (such as the land cover uses or the forest structure) unchanged in the model. Thus simulations take into account a shift in the origin of the forest and their associated bird species, keeping constant the rest of variables influencing local bird species richness (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]). Richness of pine forest dwelling birds was calculated at the scale of 10x10-km UTM grid cells for varying proportions of conversion of pine forests from planted to natural. The second step involves the conversion of plantations with exotic trees (mostly eucalypts, 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus</italic> spp.) into pine forests, assuming that such exotic plantations do not provide adequate habitat for native birds [
