<p class="p">Overall, our results indicated that converting all the current planted forests into natural forests would not be the most efficient naturalization strategy to preserve bird diversity under realistic climate change scenarios (with maximum effects at around 55% of plantations naturalized). Further, the efficiency of naturalization would be highly heterogeneous spatially, with well-delimited regions where winners and losers can be identified. Fortunately, local losses would not imply regional extinctions, given that bird distributions will likely expand northwards as bioclimatic conditions change towards conditions now typical from the southwestern Mediterranean region [

Strategies based on the naturalization of pine and the transformation of eucalypt forests into natural pine forests could better mitigate climate-driven bird diversity loss in the most productive areas in the north and northwest of Spain, than in the south and southwest of Spain, where pine plantations are mostly aimed at restoration rather than production goals due to harsh climate and soil conditions [

Optimizing the efficiency of naturalization efforts at a regional scale by integrating spatial variability in intensity-biodiversity relationships would mean targeting priority regions and sites for biodiversity enhancement, regions where naturalization would not improve biodiversity conservation, and regions where either forests or plantations could act as dispersal corridors that link current and future suitable habitats [
