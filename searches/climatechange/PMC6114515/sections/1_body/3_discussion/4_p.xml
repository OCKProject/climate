<p class="p">Nevertheless, the efficiency of the naturalization effort resulted non-linear rather than linear, with peak positive effects at around 55% of plantations naturalized under both current and expected climate conditions. This result suggests that equilibrated proportions of natural and planted pine forests within currently dominant planted

Species-specific models would be needed to test this hypothesis, which is consistent with the explanation summarized above to account for the spatial pattern of variation of the effects of pine forest origin on bird diversity [
