<p class="p">Therefore, naturalization strategies are useful for mitigating biodiversity loss under climate change scenarios, although non-linear effectiveness and spatial variability should be taken into account before applying such strategies at regional scales. Our analysis was focused on overall pine forest dwelling bird biodiversity rather than considering focal species, and therefore we did not account for the likely roles played by species-specific responses to climate change in terms of demography, dispersal, contemporary evolution, or species interactions [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Naturalization strategies should be complemented by considering such species-specific responses and the role of mitigation strategies applied to other global change drivers, such as land-use change and pollution, thereby favoring the preservation of forest biodiversity versus the relentless onslaught of climate change.
