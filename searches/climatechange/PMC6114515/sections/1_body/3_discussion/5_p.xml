<p class="p">Apart from non-linearity effects, models suggested that conversion of pine plantations into natural pine forests was not enough to fully mitigate climate-driven biodiversity loss. For this reason, we modelled a further additional naturalization effort, consisting in the conversion of eucalypt plantations into natural pine forests. Eucalypt plantations maintain substantially fewer bird species than any other Mediterranean forests due to both its exotic origin and its intensive management [

Despite this restriction, the inclusion of some other species could matter and some limitations can be derived from the list of pine forest dwelling bird species. Therefore, conversion plantations into natural pine forests increased regional bird diversity under all climatic scenarios. However, our results showed that pine naturalization plus eucalypt replacement was able to mitigate fully climate-driven bird diversity loss only under the most favorable scenarios.
