<p class="p">Large-scale combination of biodiversity inventories, information on pine forest origin and structure, climatic variables and land use patterns at regional scales allowed us to analyze whether and how the natural or planted origin of pine forests influenced regional bird diversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. Natural pine forests maintained more species of birds than equivalent pine plantations after correcting for the well-known effects of location, climate, vegetation structure and regional land-use patterns on bird diversity [

 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. A possible explanation could be because several differences between planted and natural forests cannot be gathered in our models, such as the scale of structural/age mosaics, the intensified human interventions, the frequency of disturbances, or the removal of dead wood [

 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Moreover these effects of the origin of pine forests on bird diversity vary across the territory. These circumstances suggest possible management tools that could partially mitigate bird diversity loss under climate change.
