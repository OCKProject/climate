<p class="p">We explore how bird diversity would change during the process of forest naturalization in continental Spain, a region located in a Mediterranean hotspot [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] where climate change is expected to have major effects on biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. We use bird species richness (an important group to conserve) to analyze the role of forest naturalization as a mitigation strategy for biodiversity conservation under climate change scenarios. Bird species richness has been commonly used as a proxy of biodiversity [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Further, bird species richness is usually expected to increase as traits associated with “naturalness” or “wildness” increase, although evidence supporting this idea is currently mixed [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. We have taken advantage of results for large-scale long-term monitoring protocols of both pine forests and birds in Spain by combining databases corresponding to: (1) the presence of breeding birds in 3950 10x10-km UTM grid cells [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]; (2) 95,327 forest inventory stands [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]; (3) 18 global climate models recently developed at local scales [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]; and (4) historical information and genetically-based information on whether the current pine forests are natural or planted [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. By modeling all this information, we were able to establish whether forest naturalization has positive, negative or mixed effects on local bird biodiversity, and whether and how this measure could be sufficient for mitigating the expected negative effects of climate change on bird diversity.
