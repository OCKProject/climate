<p class="p">How forests and tree plantations should be managed to make them more complex and thus preserve biodiversity has been largely debated [

 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], mainly under the general “rewilding” or “back to nature” framework of “wilder is better” [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Here, for the first time, we explore the “back to nature” approach for biodiversity conservation, in this case defined by the natural origin of the forest, within an explicit climate change framework. We specifically attempt to avoid any idealistic view of naturalization as a mitigation tool to prevent climate-driven biodiversity loss and the associated reduction in ecosystem services [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The relationships between naturalization and biodiversity are expected, in fact, to be highly variable due to the non-linear responses by species abundance and diversity to climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and management practices [
