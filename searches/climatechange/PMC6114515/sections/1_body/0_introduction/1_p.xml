<p class="p">Climate change is a serious threat to the well-being of humans, and it is considered one of the greatest challenges currently being faced by the world. Climate change is eroding the natural resources and the biodiversity of ecological systems, which will lead to unprecedented consequences unless ambitious mitigation policies are implemented [

 <xref rid="pone.0202009.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Special attention has recently been given to improving carbon storage, a vital function of different land and marine ecosystems. Among these ecosystems, the relevant role played by forests in contributing to the mitigation of CO2 emissions is regularly emphasized [
