  <title class="title">The effect of including bird species from all habitat types, not just farmland, urban and forest.</title>
  <p class="p">The same analysis is presented as shown in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> but using more species. Here, 65 species were included and those not falling into one of the aforementioned habitat types were classed as having “other” habitat preference as their species attribute. We still excluded species that were not annually censused 1981 onwards and if they were affected by hunting or culling.
