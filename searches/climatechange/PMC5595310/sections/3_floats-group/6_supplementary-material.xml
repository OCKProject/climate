  <title class="title">The effect of using different methods to obtain the modelled CTI.</title>
  <p class="p">In (a) the predicted abundances of each species, without the confounding effect of habitat breadth, was calculated in the same way as presented in the main text (i.e., dropping model coefficients of year X habitat breadth to predict abundances). In (b) an alternative but equivalent approach is presented that entails averaging over model predictions for randomly sampled values of the habitat breadth to produced predicted abundances, which are then used to calculate the modelled CTI. For further details see the legend of 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref> in the main text. Code to follow the approach for (b) is shown below.
