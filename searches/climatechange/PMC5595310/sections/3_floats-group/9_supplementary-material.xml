   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184275.s006" class="xref">S1 Table</xref> for explanation of terms) when temperature niche correlates with habitat breadth, assuming the same dynamics as presented in the simulations of the main text. The results are the mean and 95% of the bias from 500 simulation runs. The CTI bias is found to increase with the correlation with habitat breadth; to increase but at a decelerating rate with the effect size of the attributes, and to be unaffected by the number of species in the community.
