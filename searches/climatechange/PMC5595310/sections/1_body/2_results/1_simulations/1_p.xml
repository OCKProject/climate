<p class="p">Our simulations aimed to test whether a model-based approach could overcome the problem of covariation among species attributes from biasing trends in the CTI, which increase with the strength of covariation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184275.s004" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>). When there was no covariation between temperature preference and habitat breadth, the original CTI performed as well as our modelled CTI in matching the “true” CTI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2a</xref>). In contrast, when there was negative covariation between temperature preference and habitat breadth, the original CTI performed poorly and, in this case, underpredicted the CTI. This was because the positive effect of temperature preference on population growth was obscured by warm-adapted species also having a narrow habitat breadth (i.e., high specialization) that had a negative effect of on population growth. However, the modelled CTI that excluded the effects of habitat breadth on species’ abundances was still able to match the true CTI (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2a</xref>; blue, hatched line). The approach was found to be robust to overdispersion—because the extra variation was assumed to be not correlated with the species attributes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2b</xref>). When temperature preference was measured with some error, the modelled approach still performed better, i.e., its trend was closer to the true CTI, than using the original CTI method (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2c</xref>), but with measurement error in both temperature preference and habitat breadth, the modelled CTI performed only slightly better than the original CTI when there was covariation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g002" class="xref">Fig 2d</xref>). The model was found to be similarly robust to model structure decisions, shown by the inclusion of superfluous model predictors (
