<p class="p">Temperature preferences of North Sea demersal fish tended to vary with fishing exploitation. Although the pattern was not significant (F
 <sub class="sub">3,29</sub> = 0.613, P = 0.6), fish that were moderately or highly commercially exploited tended to prefer cooler temperatures than fish of less interest to fisheries (

However, a general relationship can be hypothesized assuming that larger fish are of greater commercial interest than small fish, and that larger fish tend to be more northerly distributed (and hence have a cooler temperature niche) than more southerly distributed fish [
