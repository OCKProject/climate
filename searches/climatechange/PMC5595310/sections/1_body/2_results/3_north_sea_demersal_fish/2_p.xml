<p class="p">The modelledâ€”uncorrected CTI captured reasonably well the dynamics of the original CTI indicating that the model fitted the community dynamics (

All CTIs suggested that the community shifted to more warm-adapted species but they differed in the extent to which this occurred. The modelled CTI that excluded the effects of commercial interest and body size showed a weaker temporal trend (
