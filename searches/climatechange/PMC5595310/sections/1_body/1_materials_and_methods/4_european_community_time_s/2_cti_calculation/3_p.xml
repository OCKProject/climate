<p class="p">To check if the model reasonably captured the observed dynamics of the species, we also calculated a “modelled-uncorrected CTI” using the species’ predicted abundances using all the fixed effects of the model (species attributes, year, and their interaction) plus the species random intercepts. If the model is sufficient, the modelled but uncorrected CTI should be similar to the original CTI.</p>
