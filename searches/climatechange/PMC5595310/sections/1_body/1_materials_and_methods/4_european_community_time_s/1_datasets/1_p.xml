<p class="p">We applied our approach to two real-world datasets. The first dataset was from the Danish breeding bird survey coordinated by the Dansk Ornitologisk Forening and made available through their website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dof.dk" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.dof.dk</ext-link>) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. We used national abundance indices for terrestrial species that had been reliably surveyed during 1981–2013. Species affected by hunting/culling were excluded. Temperature preference was calculated as the average spring (April to June) temperature over the breeding range of each species, following others [

 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]). However, CTI calculation is not linked with any particular method of temperature preference calculation. Species’ habitat preferences were divided into farmland and forest using the European Bird Census Council habitat classification (

[
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] when relative urban habitat use was greater than two. Because our aim here was more to illustrate the effects of covariation rather than calculate the actual CTI for specific communities, we excluded species from the dataset if they did not fall into one of these habitat groups (farmland, forest, urban) since most covariation with temperature preference was expected among these habitat types. The analysis presented in the main text was based on 36 species (
