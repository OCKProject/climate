<p class="p">We assessed whether there was any covariation between species’ temperature preferences and the other species attributes using a linear model. To support the inclusion of the attributes, we also tested whether all attributes significantly affected species’ long-term population trends by testing the interaction between year (as a continuous variable) and each attribute on logged species’ abundances, accounting for temporally autocorrelated (of order 1) errors.</p>
