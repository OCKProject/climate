<p class="p">Specifically, the model-based approach to CTI calculation involves three main steps (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0184275.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). First, we fit a statistical model to the time series of species’ observed counts using temperature preference and other species attributes (listed in each section below) as predictors. The effects of these predictors are allowed to interact with year (as a factor) so that their effects on species’ abundances can freely vary from one year to the next. Temporal autocorrelation can be accounted for by allowing for autocorrelated errors of consecutive time points [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. As the strength of temporal autocorrelation is not assumed to vary over years, it does not interfere with the estimation of the fixed effects of the model that vary among years. Second, the statistical model is used to predict species’ abundances in each year. To remove the effect of other species attributes from year-to-year changes in abundances, this prediction step is only based on the main effects for all attributes and the year-interaction effects for temperature preference (i.e., the year-interaction effects for any other species attributes are not included). We also considered removing the main effects for other species attributes but left them in since we were only interested in the possible biases of changes over time (and their removal had in any case little effect). Finally, the CTI is calculated in the same way as in the original version except that these predicted abundances are used as the weighting, rather than the observed counts; hereafter, this is called the “modelled CTI”.
