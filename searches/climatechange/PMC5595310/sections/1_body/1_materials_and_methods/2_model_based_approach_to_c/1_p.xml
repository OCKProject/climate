<p class="p">We propose a model-based approach that calculates the CTI based on the proportion of population change between years that can be attributed to the temperature preferences of the species, and eliminates the annual change that can be linked to other species attributes (e.g., habitat breadth or preference) affecting species response to other drivers of change (e.g. land use change). The power of multiple regression is exploited to separate the annual effects of temperature preference from those of other species attributes. Multiple regression models of the relationships between species attributes and their long-term population trends have already been used to infer the impacts of climate change and other drivers [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]–here we extend this approach by using multiple regression models to estimate the annual effects of species’ temperature preferences on abundances to calculate a community-level summary variable, i.e., the CTI.
