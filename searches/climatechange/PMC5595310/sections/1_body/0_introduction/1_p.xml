<p class="p">Monitoring species response to climate change is an important challenge for ecologists and conservation managers. Generalized approaches that can be applied to population census data regardless of taxonomic groups are particularly useful as climate change indicators [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Such indicators allow for standardized comparisons of how different taxonomic groups and communities in different locations are responding. As ambient temperatures increase, the relative performance of warm-adapted species is predicted to exceed the relative performance of cool-adapted ones [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This community change can be summarized by the community temperature index (CTI) [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], which is a community weighted mean—a commonly applied community summary variable [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]–of species’ temperature preferences. This change in community composition can be used as a generalized indicator of the realized impacts of temperature change on communities [
