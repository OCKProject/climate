<p class="p">Despite these advantages, it has been recognized that interpretation of the CTI is not straightforward [

 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Speciesâ€™ temperature preferences often covary with other species attributes, particularly habitat preference [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Because of such covariation, it can be difficult to interpret the ecological significance of trends in the CTI, and specifically whether they are really caused by climate change or rather another driver of environmental change. For instance, forest bird species typically have cooler temperature preferences than farmland and urban species [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Changes in land use can lead to changes in the abundances of species with different habitat preferences [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], which means that temporal trends in the CTI could be potentially due to land use change as well as climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. If such covariation is overlooked, CTI analysis could lead to misleading inferences on the rate at which species are responding to or being affected by climate change.
