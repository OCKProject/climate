<p class="p">The effect of covariation in the bird dataset of farmland, forest and urban species was much weaker although the long-term trend in the CTI was slightly steeper after correction for habitat preference. In fact, the effect was even weaker when including the whole bird community for which there was available data (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0184275.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, the original CTI is not necessarily strongly biased when there is covariation among attributes. The major change in the bird community has been the decline of farmland birds, which can be linked to changes in agricultural practices [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. This differs from the trends seen in other birds, especially forest species. However, farmland species tended to have warmer temperature preferences than forest species, and thus are expected to benefit more from climate change. Because climate change favors species that are negatively affected by land use change, the CTI trend was more positive after removing the effects of speciesâ€™ habitat preferences.
