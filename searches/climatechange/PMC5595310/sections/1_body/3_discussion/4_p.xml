<p class="p">Knowledge of the relationship between species temperature preference and other attributes, and how these attributes mediate species response to environmental drivers, can be used to predict the direction of potential bias in the CTI due to climate change-unrelated drivers. Critically, the direction of the bias depends on whether species favored by climate change are also favored or disfavored by the most significant other drivers. For example, as we found in our marine fish analysis, both climate change and fishing may benefit (or least less negatively affect) smaller, warm-adapted species. Since the same species are favored by both drivers, trends in the CTI could be biased upwards by alternative drivers (exploitation in the case), and thus the CTI trend would be less steep on correction. A recent study of Neotropical forest and farmland birds found that species likely to better cope with increased agricultural area were also those that tolerate a drier climate caused by climate change [

However, in European bird populations, farmland birds populations have warmer temperature preferences than other birds [

 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Thus, in this case, species favored by climate change are more negatively affected by significant other drivers, and the original CTI may be biased downwards.
