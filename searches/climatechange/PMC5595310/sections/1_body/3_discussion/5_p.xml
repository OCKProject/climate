<p class="p">Error in the estimation of species attributes is an important consideration in the calculation of the CTI. Devictor et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0184275.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] previously argued that trends in the CTI should be relatively robust to such error because the estimation of species’ temperature preferences only needs to reflect the gradient in preferences rather than determine their exact optimum temperature values. We found in our simulation analysis that the original and model-based CTI approach was somewhat sensitive to the accuracy of data available on species’ temperature preferences and other attributes, but only when there was covariation between species attributes. Unsurprisingly, the model-based approach was less able to correct for covariation when the underlying data was poor; but at least it did not perform worse than making no attempt to correct for it.
