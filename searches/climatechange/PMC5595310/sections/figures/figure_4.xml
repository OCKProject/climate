  <title class="title">Temperature preference and CTI trends in the demersal fish community.</title>
  <p class="p">(a) Boxplots of temperature preferences for demersal fish from the southeastern part of the North Sea according to their fisheries exploitation (left to right, n = 9, 7, 9 and 7). (b) Annual trends in the Community Temperature Index (lines are fitted loess ± 95% CI) of the same fish calculated as an average of species’ temperature preference, with weighing in three ways: original CTI (weighted by observed counts); modelled–uncorrected CTI (weighted by model predicted abundances); modelled CTI (weighted by model predicted abundances that excluded the effects of commercial interest and log maximum body length on changes in abundance between years).</p>
