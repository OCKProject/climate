  <title class="title">Temperature preference and CTI trends in the bird community.</title>
  <p class="p">(a) Boxplots of temperature preferences for Danish breeding bird species (urban, farmland and forest species, n = 7, 13 and 16) according to their habitat preference. (b) Annual trends in the Community Temperature Index (lines are fitted loess ± 95% CI) of the same birds calculated as an average of species’ temperature preferences, with weighting in three ways: original CTI (weighted by observed counts); modelled–uncorrected CTI (weighted by model-predicted abundances); modelled CTI (weighted by model-predicted abundances that excluded the effects of habitat preference on abundances changes between years).</p>
