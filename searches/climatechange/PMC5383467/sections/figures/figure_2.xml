  <p class="p">Graphs showing the marginal relationship between each bioclimatic variable and the probability of species occurrence: In the figures, the curves (red) and the mean ± standard deviation (blue) show the response of 
   <italic class="italic">Shorea robusta</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus turbinatus</italic> to the two most important variables (i.e., keeping all other bioclimatic variables at their average sample value) annual precipitation, and annual mean temperature. The 
   <italic class="italic">y</italic>‐axes indicate logistic output (probability of presence). The results suggest that there was an overall positive nonlinear response observed for annual precipitation for both species. The optimum annual mean temperature for the probability of both Sal and Garjan occurrence was approximately 28°C in all models
