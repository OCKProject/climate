  <p class="p">Proportional changes (%) in climate niches for both Dipterocarp species by 2070 under both climate scenarios. Predicted losses of pixel were calculated as a proportion of the pixels occupied in current scenario for the study area. The results of all global climate models suggest that both species are likely to lose climate suitability by 2070 under both climate scenarios</p>
