<p class="p">We selected two IPCC RCP scenarios for our study: RCP4.5, an optimistic scenario where emissions peak around 2040, and RCP8.5, a pessimistic scenario, which reflects high levels of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions, resulting in 8.5 W/m

We constructed models using current climatic conditions (average for 1950–2000) and projected to the future (given by WorldClim for the range 2061–2080, hereafter referred to as 2070). We used three global climate models (hereafter referred to as GCM) for future climatic conditions: ACCESS1.0; GFDL‐CM3; and HadGEM2‐ES (hereafter referred to as GCM 1, GCM 2, and GCM 3 respectively) (Hijmans et al.,
