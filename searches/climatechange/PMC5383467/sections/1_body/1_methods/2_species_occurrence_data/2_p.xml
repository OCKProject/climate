<p class="p">We combined the presence‐only records of Sal and Garjan from a variety of sources including field survey, online database Global Biodiversity Information Facility (

To reduce potential errors in species locations, records were “cleaned,” which included the careful review of literature for each species (Appanah &amp; Turnbull,

 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) and the removal of duplicate locations. Finally, we selected 787 and 533 records for Sal and Garjan, respectively, to model their distributions. Sal dominates tropical moist and dry deciduous forests, and Garjan dominates or codominates evergreen, semievergreen, and deciduous forest ecosystems in tropical Asia (Appanah &amp; Turnbull,

 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and combined them with the distributions of the two Dipterocarps to show their ecoregions in tropical Asia (Figure
