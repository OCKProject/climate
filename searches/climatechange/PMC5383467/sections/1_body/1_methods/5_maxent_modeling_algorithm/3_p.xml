<p class="p">Sampling bias is a well‐known issue in presence‐only distribution models and can have significant impacts on the model results (Elith et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). We created a bias file layer to limit the background points to the occurrence areas for the species and accounting for the preferential use of the sites in the study region (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). This provides MaxEnt with a background file with the same bias as the presence locations of the species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32846-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> for details). As the distributions of both species are patchy and occur in different countries (of different areas), we used state boundaries of the countries to limit the background areas for the species (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32846-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). In the model, 75% of the species presence data were used as training data, and the remaining 25% were used as testing data in order to test the model's predictive strength. We tested different regularization multiplier values and selected the default (i.e., 1) option as it performed best, that is, gave the best representation of the current distribution of both Sal and Garjan species without overfitting the model (see Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The maximum number of background points for sampling was kept at 10,000. However, we also checked that increasing the background points (e.g., 100,000) did not change the model. We executed five replicates for each species using repeated split samples to measure the amount of variability in the model and then averaged the results. Maximum numbers of iterations were set to 1,000 to allow the model to have adequate time for convergence, with 1 × 10
 <sup class="sup">−6</sup> set as the convergence threshold. We used the default “autofeatures,” which includes all features (i.e., linear, quadratic, product, threshold, and hinge features; Merow et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, or AUC values, for training and testing data was calculated for each species. We used the jackknife test to measure variable importance and percent contributions of each variable to estimate the influence of environmental variables on each species. As the data were compiled from a variety of sources and likely to have some errors, we used the 10 percentile training presence logistic threshold to define the minimum probability of suitable habitat for the Dipterocarp trees (see Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). By using this threshold, we defined suitable habitat to include 90% of the data we used to develop the models (Phillips et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>).
