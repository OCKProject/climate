<p class="p">We initially considered 19 bioclimatic variables (11 temperature and eight precipitation metrics) from the WorldClim database (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). All the bioclimatic layers were 1‐km resolution, and we processed all environmental layers using the same extent, cell size, and projection system (WGS84 Longitude‐Latitude projection), in ArcGIS 10.1. We applied Spearman's rank correlation to test for collinearity between variables at each level, to allow us to exclude highly autocorrelated variables. For instance, if a pair of variable has a correlation coefficient &gt;.7, then they were considered proxies of one another, and one of the variables was removed from the analysis (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32846-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Test model runs identified five of the 19 variables as most correlated with the current distributions: annual mean temperature (BIO1); mean diurnal range (BIO2); temperature seasonality (BIO4); annual precipitation (BIO12); and precipitation seasonality (BIO15).
