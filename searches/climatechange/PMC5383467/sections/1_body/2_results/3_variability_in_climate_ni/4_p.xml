<p class="p">The predicted extent of suitable habitat of Garjan is smaller in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam than in India (Assam, Manipur, Tripura, and Meghalaya). In particular, the Garjan‚Äêdominated semievergreen forests of the Chittagong Hill Tracts region in Bangladesh are likely to face increasing climate stress in the near future, which may lead to local extinctions of this species.</p>
