<p class="p">The predicted climatically suitable habitats of Sal and Garjan are shown for all three GCMs in Figures 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, respectively. The 10th percentile training presence logistic threshold values were used to estimate the suitable and unsuitable climatic niches for both Dipterocarp trees across the study region. The proportional changes in suitable climate niches were derived from the difference between the species' modeled current and future climate niches for each scenario. Our models predicted that suitable climate space for both Sal and Garjan will decline by 2070, under both climate scenarios and for all three GCMs (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). On average, suitable habitat conditions for Sal will decline by 24% and 34% (the mean of three GCMs) by 2070 under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In contrast, the consequences of climate change appear less severe for Garjan, with a decline of 17% and 27% (the mean of three GCMs) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively.
