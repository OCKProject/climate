<p class="p">The distribution of Sal in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Odisha, and Jharkhand in India is likely to lose suitable climate space by 2070 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). In contrast, the distribution of Sal along the Terai tract in northern India is likely to gain suitable climate space by 2070 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b–g). The lower belts of the hilly region, inner Terai, and the protected areas of Nepal, such as Chitwan National Park, Bardia National Park, and Shukla Phat Wildlife Reserve, which support dense Sal forests, are also likely to lose suitable climate niches (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The moist deciduous Sal forests in the central and northern region of Bangladesh (e.g., Madhupur National Park and Bhawal National Park) are likely to be affected most by climate change.
