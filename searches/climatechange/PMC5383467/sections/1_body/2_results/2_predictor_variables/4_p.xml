<p class="p">The individual response curves (marginal responses obtained by keeping all other bioclimatic variables at their average sample value) of the two key variables (annual precipitation and annual mean temperature) portray the relationships between each bioclimatic variable and probability of species occurrence (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a–f curves represent the response of annual precipitation and annual mean temperature for three Sal models, respectively. Curves (g–i) and (j–l) represent the response of annual precipitation and annual mean temperature for three Garjan models, respectively. The results exhibit complex but quadratic relationships between bioclimatic variables and the probability of species occurrence. In general, there was an overall positive nonlinear response observed for annual precipitation for both species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The optimum annual mean temperature for the probability of both Sal and Garjan occurrence was approximately 28°C in all models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). However, the curves showed a high probability of presence of the species at low temperatures (especially for Garjan; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> j–l). This might be due to the occurrence of the species in different forest ecosystems with a large range of temperature and elevation.
