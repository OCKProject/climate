<p class="p">Our models predict that the relative contribution of the bioclimatic variables was more or less consistent for all three GCMs (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32846-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The key bioclimatic variable explaining the current and future spatial distributions of Sal and Garjan was annual precipitation (Sal: 49.97 ± 1.33; Garjan: 37.63 ± 1.19). The relative contribution of annual mean temperature to both Sal and Garjan models was almost identical (Sal: 19 ± 1.3; Garjan: 19 ± 1.64). The seasonal climatic variables, that is, temperature seasonality (15.33 ± 0.29) and precipitation seasonality (11.43 ± 0.47), were also important contributors to the Sal models, whereas mean diurnal range (4.2 ± 0.66) was least important. In contrast, temperature seasonality (21.5 ± 0.79) and mean diurnal range (16.53 ± 1.11) were important contributors to the Garjan models, with precipitation seasonality least important (5.23 ± 1.20). The jackknife test results suggest that annual precipitation (BIO12) variable contributed most individually for both models (Fig.
