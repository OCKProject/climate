<p class="p">The AUC values for all three GCM models were better than random (0.5) for both species (mean training AUC of the three GCMs for Sal: 0.897, and for Garjan: 0.825) and showed strong model discrimination ability for predicting changes in species distribution under changing climate scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32846-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The small differences in the AUC value of training and test cases suggested little overfit in the MaxEnt predictions for both species (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32846-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The AUC standard deviations indicate the overall performance of the models was high, representing a close approximation of the true probability distribution of the Dipterocarp trees (Table
