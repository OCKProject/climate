<p class="p">The family Dipterocarpaceae comprises approximately 510 species and 16 genera, with 13 genera and 470 species largely restricted to South and Southeast Asia (Appanah &amp; Turnbull, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Dipterocarp forests play an important role in the economy of many South and Southeast Asian countries and dominate the international tropical timber market (Appanah &amp; Turnbull, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Poore, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). Dipterocarps are highly variable in terms of flowering and fruiting phenology, ecological characteristics, and geographical ranges, as they occur in evergreen, semievergreen, and deciduous forests (Appanah &amp; Turnbull, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Climatic or geographical variations, along with increasing habitat destruction, are considered key threats for Asian Dipterocarp forests. Among the 13 genera in South and Southeast Asia, the 
 <italic class="italic">Shorea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus</italic> are the first and third most diverse genera, respectively, and are important components of Dipterocarp forest ecosystems (Soepadmo, Guan, &amp; Kong, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). While most of the species of these two genera are currently listed as threatened in different categories (i.e., 109 and 34 critically endangered species for 
 <italic class="italic">Shorea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus</italic> respectively), and at least one species from each genus is now regionally extinct (
 <italic class="italic">Shorea cuspidata</italic> in Malaysia and 
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus cinereus</italic> in Indonesia), their status is due to be reviewed (IUCN Species Survival Commission, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The dominant Dipterocarp trees Sal (
 <italic class="italic">Shorea robusta</italic>) and Garjan (
 <italic class="italic">Dipterocarpus turbinatus</italic>) of South and northern continental Southeast Asia form mono‐specific canopies in dry deciduous, moist deciduous, evergreen, and semievergreen forests (Appanah &amp; Turnbull, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>; Gautam &amp; Devoe, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Further, Sal and Garjan forest ecosystems are the natural habitat of many threatened animal species (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Elephas maximus</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Ursus thibetanus</italic>). Projected climate change impacts on Sal and Garjan species have the potential to trigger significant ecosystem‐level responses.
