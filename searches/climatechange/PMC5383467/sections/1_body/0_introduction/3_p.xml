<p class="p">The climate of South and northern continental Southeast Asia is monsoonal with a large‐scale seasonal reversal of the wind regime and summer‐dominant rainfall (Loo, Billa, &amp; Singh, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In this region, climate change is driving increasing air temperatures and changes in rainfall regimes (Loo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sivakumar &amp; Stefanski, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Climate change projections suggest a significant acceleration of warming, increasing annual rainfall, and increases in extreme climate events such as floods, drought, and cyclones by 2100 (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Loo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The predicted increase in temperature by the late 21st century and early 22nd century will cause frequent changes and shifts in monsoon precipitation of up to 70% below normal levels (Schewe &amp; Levermann, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and monsoons may be delayed by up to 15 days (Schewe &amp; Levermann, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Small‐scale regional circulations are more vulnerable to monsoonal variations, and therefore, temporal and spatial distributions of monsoonal rainfall cannot be represented by general measurements (Loo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The increasing intensity of rainfall during the monsoon season is the major source of extreme climate events such as floods and landslides, which have the potential to affect vegetation (Loo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In some regions, droughts associated with significant changes in tree physiological characteristics (e.g., plant‐extractable water capacity of soil; annual evapotranspiration rate, etc.) could result in regional die‐offs in some species (e.g., Breshears et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, the impacts of climate change on tree species widely distributed over many countries, ecoregions (large units of land containing a geographically distinct assemblage of natural communities and environmental conditions), and topographies (Corlett &amp; Lafrankie, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>) in Asia have not been widely investigated (e.g., Pacifici et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Thomas et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>).
