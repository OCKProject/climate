<p class="p">Sal is a timber‐yielding dominant tree that occurs commonly on the plains and lower foothills of the Himalayas and is distributed both in the tropical moist and in the dry deciduous forests of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Bhutan (Gautam &amp; Devoe, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Sal forests naturally occur in ecoregions with a mean annual temperature ranging from 22 to 27°C and mean annual rainfall of 1,000 to 2,000 mm (Das &amp; Alam, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Gautam &amp; Devoe, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Although Sal is listed as a “least concern” species in the IUCN Red list (IUCN Species Survival Commission, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), recurrent anthropogenic disturbances such as overexploitation, deforestation, and encroachment combined with climate change, are major threats to Sal forests (Kushwaha &amp; Nandy, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Results from previous work suggest that the natural distribution of Sal has contracted very rapidly over the last few decades, and it is thus highly vulnerable to climate change (Chitale &amp; Behera,

 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) commercially important Dipterocarp tree naturally distributed in the tropical evergreen, semievergreen, and deciduous forests of Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam (Ashton, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Garjan forests are located in wide bioclimatic regions characterized by temperature range of 15.6–40.6°C and annual rainfall of 1,520 to 5,080 mm (Das &amp; Alam, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Garjan timber is used for lorry bodies, boat building, railway sleepers, transmission poles, and other construction purposes (Das &amp; Alam, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). It is potentially vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change due to the interaction with existing anthropogenic pressures such as overextraction, deforestation, and forest degradation (Ashton, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>).
