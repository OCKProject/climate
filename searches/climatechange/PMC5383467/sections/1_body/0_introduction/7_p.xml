<p class="p">Several Asian countries, including Thailand, Philippines, China, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, have imposed logging bans to halt deforestation and conserve forest resources (Sarker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, the trend of deforestation and associated biodiversity loss has called into question the effectiveness of these bans, and factors such as lack of effective conservation policies and accounting for climate risks also hinder the success of forest conservation and restoration (Sarker et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Species distribution models (SDMs) are useful for documenting biodiversity and understanding the effects of climate‐ and human‐induced changes (Dale et al.,
