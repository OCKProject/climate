<p class="p">Among the biotic components of forests, trees are one of the earliest groups to be affected by climate change, through changes in phenology and distribution, and these changes could have cascading effects on the functioning of forest ecosystems (Butt et al.,

Although trees generally respond slowly to climate change, their long life spans suggest they will be unlikely to adapt fast enough to avoid negative impacts of climate change, such as heat and moisture stress and resulting high mortality rates (Margrove et al.,

The indirect effect of changes in tree flowering and fruiting phenology on pollinators and seed dispersal agents (e.g., mammals, birds, and insects) that rely on periodically available plant resources for their survival, may be more serious than the direct effects (Butt et al.,
