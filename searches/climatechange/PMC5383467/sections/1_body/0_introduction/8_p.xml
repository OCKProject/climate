<p class="p">The aim of this paper was to assess the vulnerability of two Dipterocarp trees (Sal and Garjan) of South and Southeast Asia to climate change by modeling their future distributions under two IPCC Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. We projected the potential distributions for both species in 2070 under two climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). This will allow the identification of future suitable climate space for these Dipterocarp trees and help inform conservation priorities for these threatened species in the region.</p>
