<p class="p">Although the projected distribution scenarios for the three GCMs were not identical in terms of climatically suitable habitat conditions for Sal and Garjan, the relative contribution of all bioclimatic variables used in the models and their AUC values were similar (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32846-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece32846-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), and the trends of the response curves of the variables for all GCMs were identical (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Our results suggest that climate niches for both Dipterocarp trees are likely to come under increasing stress and potentially result in range contraction and distribution shifts across the region during the 21st century.
