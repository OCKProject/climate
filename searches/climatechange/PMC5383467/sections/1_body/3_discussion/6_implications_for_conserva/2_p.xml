<p class="p">The findings of our models can be tailored to suit conservation guidelines for Sal and Garjan in South and Southeast Asia by identifying critically vulnerable habitats and potential climatically suitable habitats where artificial regeneration should be undertaken for forest restoration. Our models detected a shift in the distribution of suitable climate space for Sal outside of its natural distribution toward the deciduous and semievergreen forests of northeastern India, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32846-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d,e). As a conservation strategy, assisted migration of Sal into these potentially climatically suitable areas may be possible under a wide range of possible future climates (e.g., Hällfors et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). In addition, the modeling outputs of our study can be used to categorize the natural habitats of Sal and Garjan trees as low to high risk under changing climates in the study region to inform conservation planning. For instance, Sal and Garjan plantations should be preferentially introduced to the climatically suitable sites, and more conservation care for the natural regeneration of these trees should be taken in the sties calculated as high risk under future climates. The rotation period of Sal and Garjan timber may be shortened in those sites and replaced with other species assessed as more suitable under changing climatic conditions.
