<p class="p">Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle as they hold more carbon than the atmosphere (Pan etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Sal and Garjan are the long rotation species in South and Southeast Asia and are important for ecosystem functioning and carbon storage. Therefore, small changes in their distributions can have large implications in terms of carbon storage and stocks as they are distributed over a large area in Asia (e.g., Sal forests cover over 11 million ha in India, Bangladesh, and Nepal). Bioclimatic and ecological traits of Dipterocarp species in a particular forest ecosystem are very important for successful forest management, as climate change can drive significant alterations in forest site conditions (Falk &amp; Mellert, 
 <xref rid="ece32846-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). This type of study, of changes in suitable climate space, and therefore the distribution of tree species, could inform forest carbon management.
