Changes in precipitation and temperature regimes, including the duration of the dry season, may result in phenological shifts of both Dipterocarp trees, with indirect effects on floral and faunal species dependent on them. Many terrestrial birds, mammals, and insects that rely directly and indirectly on the flowers, fruits, and seeds of Dipterocarps are likely to be adversely affected by climate change (Butt et al.,
