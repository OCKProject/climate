<p class="p">Although the present study provides potentially useful first results on the understandability of the IPCC health chapter graphs, some limitations of this study must be acknowledged and discussed. First, our sample of COP22 attendees does not constitute a representative sample of either the primary target audience (i.e., governments and policy-makers) or broader audiences (i.e., the scientific community, non-governmental organizations, the business sector, or the wider public). Although all of these groups were represented in the COP22 sample, it remains unclear whether the present results hold for representative samples for each of these audiences. For the very common mistake of assuming linearity, however, the present results might arguably not be subject to much variation since previous research has shown that linearity constitutes a very fundamental human intuition [

Second, we did not track the number of people who were asked whether they wanted to take part during the conference, and therefore cannot give the response rate. Since people were approached by asking whether they wanted to take part in a study on understandability of IPCC graphs, it seems likely that though a self-selection effect our participants were interested in this topic. Future studies should therefore aim for representative samples of relevant audiences to estimate understanding of the graphs. Third, we did not incentivize correct answers which might undermine participantsâ€™ motivation to engage with the graphs. Although accuracy of understanding might not necessarily be incentivized in real-world situations, future studies should investigate the extent to which graph comprehension changes when accuracy is incentivized. In sum, the present pilot study does not allow to draw conclusions on the understandability of IPCC health graphs for a representative sample of the IPCC audience. It does, however, show the need to study understandability of IPCC graphs more in-depth in future studies.
