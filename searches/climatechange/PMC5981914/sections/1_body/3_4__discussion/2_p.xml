 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00875-f0A1" class="xref">Figure A1</xref>) depicting health impacts of climate change that was newly developed for the health chapter, and Graph 2 (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00875-f0A1" class="xref">Figure A1</xref>) depicting the rather intuitive relationship between temperature and work output. The COP22 sample had the most difficulties understanding Graph 3 depicting health cost effectiveness of selected interventions. This graphâ€™s x-axis displaying health cost effectiveness seemed to pose a particular barrier to understanding. Specifically, 22% of the sample were able to pinpoint the most health cost effective intervention, 26% were able to indicate which of two given measures is more health cost effective, and only 15% could read off by how much health cost effectiveness increases from one measure to another.
