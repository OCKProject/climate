<p class="p">As is typically found, overconfidence was strongly and negatively associated with accuracy for both the COP22, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(57) = − 0.66, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, and the student sample, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(81) = −0.53, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.001, suggesting that overconfidence in one’s understanding increased as actual understanding decreased. Mean calibration (C-Index) did not differ between the COP22 (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 0.17, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.16) and the student sample (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 0.14, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.14), 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(138) = 1.4, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.16. The signed over-/underconfidence, however, was higher for the COP22 (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 0.14, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.29) than the student sample (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 0.25), 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>(138) = 1.99, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.048. Moreover, subjective and objective understanding were unrelated for the COP22 sample, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(57) = 0.10, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.45, but associated for the student sample, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>(82) = 0.29, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.009.
