 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-00875-f001" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>), we additionally give the mean results of whether both aspects were answered correctly. Please note for the numerical question 4b, 10,000 would be the correct answer, but also 1000 was counted as correct to account for rounding off values at the x-axis.
