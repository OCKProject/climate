<p class="p">The health chapter contains a total of seven graphs, two of which were newly-developed for the report, and five of which were taken from scientific publications directly. To assess participants’ objective understanding, three graphs from the chapter were selected. The basis for selecting these graphs was (a) to include graphs that depict numerical relations, which the vast majority of graphs do, but which excludes the “conceptual diagram” in the health chapter ([
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00875" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], p. 717); and (b) to include both a graph that was newly devolved for the chapter ([
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00875" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], p. 735; here: Graph 1), as well as graphs that were taken from scientific publications ([
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00875" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>], p. 732 and p. 737, here: Graph 2 and Graph 3). The selected graphs can be found in
