<p class="p">Previous research showed that domain-specific knowledge (expertise), ability to reason with numbers (numeracy), and the ability to understand information presented graphically (graph literacy) are relevant characteristics of the recipient that affect graph comprehension. Specifically, expertise is known to facilitate graph comprehension. Expert meteorologists, for example, tend to cluster features from weather maps on the basis of meaningful causal relationships, whereas novices to meteorology cluster the information on the basis of surface similarity [

Given that IPCC graphs are typically information-dense, we expect expertise in the area of climate change to facilitate their understanding. High numeracy is known to be less important for the comprehension of relatively simple graphs [

 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-00875" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>], and should therefore influence comprehension in the present case of the relatively complex graphs. Graph literacy in turn was found to influence the comprehension of graphs even among highly numerate and well-educated people [
