<p class="p">Attendees of the United Nations Framework Conference in Marrakesh, 2016 (COP22) answered questions on three graphs from the health chapter. This allowed us to gather data on how relevant audiences understand these graphs. The presented results should be considered pilot since our sample of COP22 attendees constitutes a relevant, but not representative sample of the entire audience of the IPCC reports. A lay-sample without particular interest or expertise in climate change answered the same questions for comparison, namely Heidelberg university mathematics students. They contrasted with the climate experts in that mathematics students (i) likely possess less top-down knowledge on climate change and health; but (ii) are likely to be highly numerate, and more used to reason with complex graphs. This comparison can help estimate the extent to which domain-specific knowledge versus proficiency to reason with information-dense graphs and numbers facilitate understanding of the IPCC health chapter graphs. Furthermore, the comparison can help estimate the degree to which experts compared to novices have an insight into which aspects of the health chapter graphs they do, and which they do not understand.</p>
