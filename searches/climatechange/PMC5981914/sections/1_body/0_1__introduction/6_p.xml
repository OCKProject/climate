<p class="p">Prior research has shown that experts’ calibration—that is, the correspondence of their subjective accuracy with objective accuracy—varies widely. Experts in some areas are very well-calibrated in judgments related to their area of expertise. For example, the subjective and objective accuracy of meteorologists’ predictions are comparatively well-aligned ([

 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00875" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). What is largely unknown, however, is how well-calibrated expert audiences are in assessing their understanding of scientific climate change information. Here we estimate how well experts’ subjective confidence in their understanding of the graphs aligns with their objective understanding.
