 <p class="p">Despite long-term domestication to stable temperatures, laboratory-strain zebrafish have kept the same upper thermal tolerance as wild-caught zebrafish held under laboratory conditions. Wild zebrafish tested in India, however, had a lower thermal tolerance highlighting that under certain conditions model organisms can be representative for climate change research.</p>
