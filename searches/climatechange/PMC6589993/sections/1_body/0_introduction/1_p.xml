 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Angilletta, 2009</xref>). This phenotypic plasticity can be advantageous to organisms living in heterogeneous environments and could similarly be so under a climate change scenario. However, the thermal acclimation process can be both energetically costly (

 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krebs and Loeschcke, 1994</xref>) and maintaining the capacity to acclimate when living in homogeneous environments, such as in a laboratory, might therefore be disadvantageous and selected against. This means that using laboratory model species for experiments on thermal tolerance might underestimate the acclimation potential of animals in nature. Yet, highly domesticated species are frequently used to answer questions on thermal tolerance and global warming impacts (
