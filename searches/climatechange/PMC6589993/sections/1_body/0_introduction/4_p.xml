<p class="p">The aims of this study were the following: 
 <list list-type="simple" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">1) To test if the domestication process, with lack of thermal extremes and thermal fluctuations, has reduced thermal tolerance of laboratory-held zebrafish compared to wild zebrafish, and if so, how soon the difference appears in the domestication process (Experiment 1).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">2) To compare the effects of daytime water temperature acclimation versus laboratory temperature acclimation on acute thermal tolerance of wild zebrafish tested on-site in India versus in the laboratory (Experiment 2).</p>
