<p class="p">In Experiment 1, we measured the acute thermal tolerance of wild-caught zebrafish on-site in India and at three stages of the domestication process in the laboratory: (i) wild-caught zebrafish acclimated to the laboratory (28°C) for 1 month, (ii) F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation of wild-caught zebrafish (short-term domesticated) and (iii) AB-WT laboratory-strain zebrafish (long-term domesticated). In Experiment 2, we measured the acute thermal tolerance on-site in India of wild zebrafish collected at a range of temperatures, as well as of fish from the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation that were acclimated to a wide temperature range (10–34°C) in the laboratory for 30 days. This allowed us to compare the acclimation capacity of wild and short-term domesticated zebrafish. To measure thermal tolerance, we used the critical thermal maxima (CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) test, which provides a quick and repeatable measure of acute thermal tolerance in zebrafish (
