<p class="p">Surprisingly little is known about the natural environment of zebrafish, especially regarding their thermal background. Zebrafish inhabit rivers and streams in India, Nepal and Bangladesh and have been found in water temperatures ranging from 12.3–38.6°C (

However, it is currently unknown what thermal safety margin (the difference between an organism’s thermal tolerance and the environmental extremes) wild zebrafish might have. As thermal extremes increase in frequency, the shallow waters inhabited by wild zebrafish may reach temperatures above their maximum thermal tolerance leading to mass mortality. Whether or not zebrafish will be able to cope with future climate warming will partly be determined by their capacity for thermal acclimation. A greater understanding of the thermal biology and acclimation capacity of zebrafish both in the wild and in the laboratory is therefore urgently needed.
