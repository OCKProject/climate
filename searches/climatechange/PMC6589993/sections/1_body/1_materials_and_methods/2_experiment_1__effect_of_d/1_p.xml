<p class="p">To investigate whether laboratory acclimation and/or domestication has an effect on thermal tolerance, we measured the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of four populations of zebrafish. All populations were acclimated to, or had a site temperature of, 28Â°C: wild fish tested on-site (pop. India), laboratory-acclimated wild fish (pop. Ancestral), short-term domesticated wild fish (pop. F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>) and long-term domesticated AB-WT laboratory strain (pop. Lab) (
