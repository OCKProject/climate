<p class="p">During the collection event in October 2016, environmental data from 12 sites were collected (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). We recorded the GPS coordinates and photographed the sites to document topography and vegetation coverage. Where possible, underwater video footage was taken of the fish at the field sites. Water temperature was measured using a high-precision thermometer (testo-112; Testo, Lenzkirch, Germany). Two water samples per site were collected to measure turbidity
 <sub class="sub">NTU</sub> (nephelometric turbidity units, measured using a turbidity metre, HI93703; Hanna instruments, Limena, Italy). Conductivity was measured at each site (Jenway 4070, Stone, UK). Additionally,
