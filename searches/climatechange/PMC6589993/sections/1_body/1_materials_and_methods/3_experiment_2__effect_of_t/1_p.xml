<p class="p">To test whether laboratory-habituated and short-term domesticated wild fish (F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation) acclimated to a range of temperatures in the laboratory differ in their thermal tolerance compared to fish tested on-site in the wild (i.e. acclimated to a naturally varying range of temperatures), we conducted a temperature acclimation experiment at NTNU (in May–June 2017). A random subset of wild-caught zebrafish (F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 130, from the collection event in August to September 2016) were acclimated to temperatures ranging from 10–34°C in 2°C increments with 10 fish acclimated to each temperature (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Based on pilot experiments, these temperatures represent the range where zebrafish can maintain performance (i.e. swimming activity, feeding and growth). At the start of the experiment, all fish were 6 weeks old and housed at 28°C in 63-l aquaria, 10 fish per aquaria. In total, 13 aquaria were used, one allocated for each acclimation temperature (
 <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). The water temperature was increased or decreased in a daily step-wise manner (2°C per day) using titanium heaters (TH-100; Aqua Medic, Bissendorf, Germany) controlled by thermostats (ITC-306T; Inkbird, Shenzhen, China), until final acclimation temperatures were reached for all groups (after a maximum of 10 days). A group of 10 fish were constantly kept at 28°C, serving as the control (these fish were also included in the statistical analysis of experiment 1, as pop. F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>). The fish were held for 36 days at these temperatures in closed system aquaria, with regular water changes. Temperatures were monitored in real time and continuously recorded (Picotech TC-08, Cambridgeshire, UK) in each aquarium. The fish were fed Tetra Pro flakes 
 <italic class="italic">ad libitum</italic> twice daily. After 30 days, when the fish were 13 weeks old, all underwent a CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> test, using the method outlined below.
