<p class="p">CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was measured using the method outlined in 
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morgan 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2018
 </xref>). In short, 4–10 zebrafish were placed inside a heating tank filled with 10 l water (with the corresponding temperature to the holding temperature of the fish). The water in the tank was continuously pumped over a coil heater, creating a homogenous heating rate of 0.3°C min
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> in accordance with 
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lutterschmidt and Hutchison (1997</xref>). Loss of equilibrium (LOE) was the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> endpoint (defined as the temperature at which disorganized and disorientated swimming occurred for at least 3 seconds). Upon onset of LOE, temperature was recorded to the nearest 0.1°C, and the fish was placed in 28°C water to allow recovery. Once the fish had recovered it was anaesthetized and weighed to the nearest 0.01 g. In all laboratory experiments, fish were fasted for 24 hours prior to the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> test and survival after the test was high (&gt;95%). In the on-site experiments, the feeding state of the zebrafish was unknown, but the fish were not fed during the ~ 6 hours holding period prior to commencement of the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> test.
