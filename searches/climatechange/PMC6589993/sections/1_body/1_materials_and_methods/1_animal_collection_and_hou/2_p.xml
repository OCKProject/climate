<p class="p">Fish were also collected in August to September 2016 (
 <italic class="italic">N</italic> = 5000) from multiple sites in North West Bengal. These fish were imported by a commercial fish importer (Imazo AB, Sweden) and held in quarantine for 3 weeks in Sweden and subsequently transported to the laboratory aquarium facility at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU), Trondheim, Norway, in November 2016. At NTNU, the ancestral zebrafish were housed in 63-l aquaria (maximum density, 0.5 fish l
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) with internal filtering and a flow-through system replacing 40% of the water volume daily. Temperature was maintained at 28 ± 0.5°C, and the water was well aerated. Fish were fed 0.1 g dry flakes (TetraPro) per aquarium twice per day and live

 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation was produced by randomly grouping three males and three females of the ancestral generation together to breed multiple times. If fertilized eggs were found (after 14–20 hours), we knew that a minimum of 2 parents and a maximum of 6 parents had contributed to the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation. In total, the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation originated from a minimum of 350 ancestral parents.
