<p class="p">Experiment 1: to investigate whether laboratory acclimation and/or domestication has an effect on thermal tolerance, we tested whether population (India, Ancestral, F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> and Lab) had an effect on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. We used an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) followed by a Tukey honest significance test (HSD) 
 <italic class="italic">post hoc</italic> test, with CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as the response variable and population as the fixed effect. Weight was included in the model as a covariate. Since this analysis was performed on fish acclimated to a temperature of 28°C, and thus for the India population only included fish tested at one site (site 8, site temperature = 28°C) while the remaining populations originated from fish collected at several sites, we investigated whether any differences in CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> could be due to differing genetic diversity by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) for each population. We used
