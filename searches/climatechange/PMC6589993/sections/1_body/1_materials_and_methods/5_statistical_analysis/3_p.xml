<p class="p">To investigate whether additional environment data affected on-site CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in India, a linear mixed effects model was fitted with CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as the response variable, site temperature and conductivity as the fixed effects and site number as a random effect (since multiple fish were measured per site). We also measured turbidity at the 10 sites (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), however, due to the positive relationship between turbidity and conductivity (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.62, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001), both could not be included in the same model. We chose to include conductivity over turbidity as the measurements of conductivity were more stable. Temperature and conductivity were not strongly correlated (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.17, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.13) and could therefore be included in the same model. Since 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, pH and oxygen saturation were not measured at all sites (Table 1), they could not be included in the model.
