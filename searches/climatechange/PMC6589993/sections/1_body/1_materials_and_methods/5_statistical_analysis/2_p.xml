<p class="p">Experiment 2: to investigate whether thermal acclimation capacity differs between wild and short-term domesticated fish, we used a subset of the temperature acclimated F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation fish (acclimation temperatures, 24–34°C) and compared the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> of those with the India population tested on-site across acclimation (i.e. site) temperature. The laboratory acclimation range of 24–34°C was chosen as it represents the range of site temperatures in India. A linear model was used to test the relationship between temperature and population on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. The interaction between temperature and population was also included in the model. A second-order polynomial regression was fitted to illustrate the effect of acclimation temperature on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> on the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation across the whole temperature acclimation range (i.e. 10–34°C).
