<p class="p">When investigating if other environmental variables measured on-site in India affected CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, aside from site temperature, we found a negative relationship between conductivity and CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> (β = −0.0045 ± 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,78</sub> = 7.23, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.04, 
 <xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 6</xref>) and only 4% of the variance was explained by site number. This negative relationship is, however, driven by the site with the highest conductivity (site 12; 218 μS cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) as there is no significant relationship if this site is removed (β = −0.0034 ± 0.001, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">1,70</sub> = 1.79, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.24).
