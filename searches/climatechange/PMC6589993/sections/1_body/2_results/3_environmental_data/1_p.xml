<p class="p">Fish collection sites (collection event in October 2016) were clustered around 3 locations, sampled over 3 days (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The sites ranged from open riverbanks with clear flowing water to dense forests with turbid and slow-moving water (
 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). Daytime site water temperatures ranged from 24.5–34.9°C (

 <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). The

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> measurements showed high levels of dissolved CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> at all sites (
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and therefore it is perhaps unsurprising that zebrafish behaviour is largely unaffected by elevated CO

 <xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vossen 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). Oxygen levels varied between sites (3.92–8.92 mg l
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>; 
 <xref rid="TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), and since zebrafish are hypoxia-tolerant species that are able to survive and grow at O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels down to 0.8 mg l
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> (
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van der Meer 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2005
