<p class="p">High crowding densities and inbreeding are two conditions that are likely to occur during domestication (

 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sørensen 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2003
 </xref>), and the expression of Hsps, in some cases, is correlated with an organism’s thermal tolerance (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1999
 </xref>). This suggests that Hsps could be under stabilizing selection in the laboratory and provides an alternative hypothesis to why high thermal tolerance has been maintained under optimal thermal conditions in laboratory-held fish. Importantly, we only used one of a multitude of available strains of laboratory zebrafish. We do not know whether all laboratory strains or even all populations within the AB-WT strain will have maintained their thermal tolerance during domestication or whether this is unique to the specific population that we tested.
