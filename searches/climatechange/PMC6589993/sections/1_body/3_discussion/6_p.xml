<p class="p">The high temperatures that zebrafish likely experience in the wild could provide an alternative explanation for why high thermal tolerance has been maintained in laboratory populations. If there has been strong selection on high thermal tolerance in the wild historically, then the genetic diversity for this trait could have been reduced (

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Falconer, 1981</xref>), lack of genetic diversity would mean that the trait would not evolve or is fixed. A low genetic diversity in thermal tolerance in the founding population of the AB-WT laboratory fish could be the reason why high thermal tolerance persists in the absence of extreme temperatures despite decades of domestication.
