<p class="p">In India, the conductivity of the water where we found zebrafish was lower (62.3–218.0 μS cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>) than what is commonly used in zebrafish facilities (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2012
 </xref>). It is surprising therefore that a relatively small increase in conductivity had a negative effect on thermal tolerance. However, a follow-up laboratory experiment (Åsheim 
 <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, in preparation) over a much wider range of salinities found that salinity had no effect on CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> in zebrafish. This suggests that the negative relationship we found in India was caused by a confounding factor (e.g. pollutants, turbidity and nutrient load) that co-varies with conductivity rather than being caused by conductivity itself. This is further supported by the positive correlation between conductivity and turbidity that was found in this study.
