<p class="p">Acclimation temperature is commonly known to affect an ectotherm’s thermal tolerance (

 </xref>), and this is what we observed in zebrafish both in the wild and in the laboratory. Even though there was a positive relationship between water temperature and thermal tolerance in the wild, water temperature had a much stronger effect on thermal tolerance for laboratory-acclimated wild fish (F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation), suggesting the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation differ in their acclimation capacity compared to the wild fish. In the wild, zebrafish spawn mostly at the onset of the monsoon season (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2007
 </xref>) during which time water temperatures could be low. If the temperature during embryonic development was higher in the laboratory-reared F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation (26–28°C) compared to in the wild, this could explain the differences in acclimation capacity (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>). In addition, while the acclimation temperature was precise and constant for the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> generation, it was an imprecise measurement in the wild, since the thermal profiles of the sites are unknown. It is therefore challenging to compare laboratory acclimation temperature and site temperature.
