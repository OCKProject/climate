<p class="p">Wild zebrafish tested on-site in India had a lower thermal tolerance (CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) compared to short-term laboratory-acclimated wild zebrafish, first generation laboratory-reared wild zebrafish, as well as domesticated AB-WT laboratory zebrafish. The opposite result, i.e. that wild fish have a higher CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> than domesticated lines, has previously been shown in certain species of trout, where it was suggested that genetic differences due to domestication could have altered thermal tolerance (

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carline and Machung, 2001</xref>). Indeed, daily thermal fluctuations and extreme temperatures, such as what many species of fish experience in the wild, have previously been shown to increase, not decrease, thermal tolerance both in zebrafish (
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schaefer and Ryan, 2006</xref>) and in other ectotherms (
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Feldmeth 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1974
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kern 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2015
 </xref>). It is therefore somewhat surprising that we found the opposite result here. The improved conditions in a laboratory environment (e.g. high water quality and no diseases or parasites) could provide an explanation for the increased thermal tolerance in the laboratory. This was speculated to be the reason for a similar increase in thermal tolerance in wild-caught 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila</italic> after being brought into the laboratory (
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Krebs 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2001
 </xref>). Diet is also known to modulate the thermal tolerance in fish (
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hoar and Cottle, 1952</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gomez Isaza 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2019
 </xref>), so the shift from a natural diet to laboratory diet (dry food and artemia) could have increased the thermal tolerance. The laboratory-held fish were fasted for 24 hours prior to testing their thermal tolerance, while the feeding state of the fish in the wild was unknown (but no food was provided during the 6 hours holding period before the CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> test commenced). If the wild fish had recently fed, this could have reduced their CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>. In addition, the wild fish may have experienced greater handling stress than the laboratory-held fish and thus might have been more sensitive to the testing conditions. The site temperature in India was also only measured once at each site and during daytime. Therefore, the recorded temperature at the time of collection may represent the peak temperature and be an overestimation of the average daily temperature that the fish experienced and were acclimated to. However, since it was not possible to stay at each field site for a full day or return to the sites over different seasons we do not know the extent to which daily or seasonal temperatures fluctuated at these sites and the effect this could have on the wild zebrafish’s thermal tolerance. Finally, the lower thermal tolerance in the wild could be due to a low genetic diversity at each of the sites. At 28 degrees, the wild fish tested on-site came from just one site, compared to the ancestral and F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> populations that originated from multiple sites. However, we were unable to detect any differences in variation between the populations tested here.
