<p class="p">Counter to our prediction, there was no difference in thermal tolerance between the laboratory-acclimated wild-caught zebrafish and domesticated groups. The long-term domesticated line had the same, high, CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> as both the ancestral laboratory-acclimated population and the F
 <sub class="sub">1</sub> short-term domesticated population. This suggests that thermal tolerance is not a costly trait for zebrafish and that the domestication process may not have as strong effect on thermal tolerance as it may have on other traits. This is further supported by 
 <xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stitt 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> (2014
 </xref>) who found that the thermal tolerance of brook trout (
 <italic class="italic">Salvelinus fontinalis</italic>) populations still reflect the historical adaptations to conditions in their ancestral sources despite being maintained for many generations in captivity. Furthermore, the population with the longest time in captivity (25 generations) had the highest thermal tolerance of all populations tested (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Possible reasons for why thermal tolerance has been conserved in zebrafish in the absence of thermal stress could be related to a potentially complex genetic architecture underlying the trait. Currently, very little is known about the specific genes involved in thermal tolerance. As a wide range of processes (molecular, cellular and physiological) are thought to be able to affect thermal tolerance; however, it is likely that many genes would have to be modified to see an evolutionary change (
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bettencourt 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1999
 </xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">Drosophila</italic>, for example, a trade-off association between heat and cold tolerance has been identified suggesting the genes for these two traits are either highly linked or pleiotropic (
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Norry 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). In addition, if genes for thermal tolerance are pleiotropic or highly linked to genes for other fitness traits that are under high selection pressure in the laboratory (e.g. fecundity and growth rate), this would further constrict evolvability and offers an additional explanation to why thermal tolerance has been conserved in the absence of thermal stress. Additionally, if evolution of thermal tolerance is a slow process, then zebrafish may not have been domesticated for a sufficient time.
