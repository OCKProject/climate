<p class="p">Despite these uncertainties, the thermal safety margin (difference between acclimated temperature and upper tolerance temperature) was just 5.4°C at the warmest site in India and decreased with increasing acclimation temperature. Since our measurements were not taken at the warmest time of the year it is likely that the maximum temperatures at these sites can be higher. Indeed, zebrafish have been found in the wild at temperatures as high as 38.6°C (
