<p class="p">In conclusion, we have shown that thermal tolerance is lower in wild zebrafish tested on-site compared to in laboratory-acclimated and domesticated populations. The lower thermal tolerance and reduced acclimation response observed in India was likely due to environmental rather than genetic effects, but it does illustrate that wild zebrafish can be found very close to their thermal limits. If the lower thermal tolerance observed in the wild compared to the laboratory was due to some of the reasons discussed (e.g. diet, disease and stress) then we might overestimate the warming tolerance of wild populations if using laboratory experiments alone, and this does provide some cause for concern. Time in captivity, however, had no effect as CT
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> did not differ between short-term laboratory-acclimated and domesticated fish. Thermal tolerance therefore appears to be a robust trait, which has been maintained during domestication in zebrafish. Experiments using laboratory-kept species and model organisms may therefore sometimes be appropriate for addressing questions about the impacts of global warming.
