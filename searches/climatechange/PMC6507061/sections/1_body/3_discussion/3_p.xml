<p id="Par36" class="p">In contrast with the prophenoloxidase activity, our expectations with respect to survival were fulfilled. The negative effects of the parasite on triatomine fitness are not new. For instance, Botto-Mahan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>] found that 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> infection delays the development and reduces survival rates in the triatomine 
 <italic class="italic">Mepraia spinolai</italic>. Studies more closely related to our work found that 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> reduced the survival of the triatomine 
 <italic class="italic">Rhodnius prolixus</italic>, but only at 20 °C and 30 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. In our case, the insects were more affected by the Chilpancingo strain than by the Morelos strain. These effects on survival are related to those on the prophenoloxidase activity, suggesting that the vector allocates more resources to defend itself from a more dangerous pathogen. The more rapid death in insects infected with the Chilpancingo strain could be because this strain extracted more resources from the insect than the Morelos strain, but the precise mechanisms underlying infection costs in triatomines are still unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Interestingly, the lethal effects of the Chilpancingo strain are even more perceptible at higher temperatures (34 °C). On one hand, these results do not agree with the report by Elliot et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>], who did not find a negative effect of high temperatures on 
 <italic class="italic">R. prolixus</italic> survival. However, much lower temperatures (30 °C) were used in those experiments than in our work (34 °C). It is possible that our temperature was closer to the lethal threshold for 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic> than the one used by Elliot et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>] for 
 <italic class="italic">R. prolixus</italic>. On the other hand, our results may help us to understand the adaptation of triatomines to thermal thresholds in nature. For instance, it has been reported that the optimal temperature is 30 °C and the upper thermal limit for 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic> rarely seems to exceed 34 °C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>], which is in agreement with our results. While temperature levels in our study were selected based on the thresholds predicted by different climate change scenarios, it is likely that these scenarios are already occurring in some torrid areas of Mexico inhabited by 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>].
