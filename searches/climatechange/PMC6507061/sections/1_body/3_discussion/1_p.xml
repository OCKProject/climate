<p id="Par34" class="p">The immune capacity of triatomines against infection by 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> was enhanced when the temperature was increased from 20 °C to 30 °C, but this pattern changed dramatically at 34 °C. Our results, indicating a more efficient prophenoloxidase activity before a subtle increase in temperatures, are in agreement with reports on other insects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. This could be explained as the result of a better prophenoloxidase activity 
 <italic class="italic">via</italic> phenotypic plasticity at moderately higher temperatures, which become inviable as temperature reaches a lethal threshold. In terms of defense against a pathogen, a temperature close to lethal levels could preclude the action of the triatomine prophenoloxidase activity against an infection, which is consistent with our results on nymph survival. Conversely, the insect may respond in the form of fever during infection, which may help them to fight off 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. If this were the case, however, one would expect that a high temperature may help insects to produce such an antiparasitic effect, but it is not the case as survival was lower as temperature rose. It is worth noting, however, that despite the strong effect of higher temperatures on reduced survival, this does not mean that the triatomine bugs do not rely on a fever response to deal with pathogens. Actually, other studies have found that triatomines show fever responses when sick [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. It would be interesting to see whether 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic> bugs increase their fitness when allowed to choose ambient temperatures while facing different 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> isolates.
