 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> in triatomines is known to be closely related with the intestinal tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Since the AMG is the anatomic region first colonized by the parasite and where its reproduction in the vector begins (and to a lesser extent in the PMG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]), the prophenoloxidase activity in this region is expected to be more robust, as our results indicate. This is consistent with the massive death of the parasite observed within a few hours of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>], although it is not clear why the prophenoloxidase activity is not high enough in other gut regions to complete parasite removal. A possible explanation is that the cost of infection can affect AMG only, where parasite replication and resource sequestering could be considerably higher. Alternatively, it could be energetically prohibitive for the triatomine to maintain a high prophenoloxidase activity to kill the few surviving parasites. Such a tolerance would imply that relatively low parasite levels would be more preferable for the insect than complete removal [
