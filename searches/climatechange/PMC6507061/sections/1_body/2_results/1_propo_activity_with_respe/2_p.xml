<p id="Par30" class="p">In general, as temperature increased, proPO activity decreased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Infection status also affected proPO activity, with the highest activity rate being observed in the Chilpancingo group, and the lowest in the controls (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The intestine region was also a good predictor of proPO, where the AMG yielded higher activity levels than the PMG and rectum, with no significant differences between the latter groups (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Since the AMG is the site with a significantly higher proPO expression, and no differences were observed between the PMG and rectum, only the AMG will be used in the following comparisons. proPO activity was higher in the Chilpancingo group than in the Morelos and control groups at 20 °C, but these differences were not observed at 30 and 34 °C, which showed a reverse pattern with respect to 20 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
