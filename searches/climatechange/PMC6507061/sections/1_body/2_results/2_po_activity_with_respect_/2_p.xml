<p id="Par32" class="p">The highest PO activity values were observed at 30 °C and were significantly lower at 34 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). With respect to infection status, the Chilpancingo group showed the highest PO activity, and control showed the lowest (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). With respect to intestine region, the AMG yielded the highest response, with no differences between the PMG and rectum (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). As with proPO, PO activity levels in the AMG will be used in the following comparisons, since no differences between the PMG and rectum groups were observed. PO activity was higher in the Chilpancingo group than in the Morelos and control groups at 20 °C, but these differences were not observed at 30 or 34° C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). Note that while the Chilpancingo group showed higher PO activity than the Morelos group at 20 °C, this pattern was opposite at 30 and 34 °C.
