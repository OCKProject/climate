<p id="Par23" class="p">proPO and PO activity in triatomine AMG, PMG and rectum were spectrophotometrically determined [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Briefly, 25 µl each of AMG, PMG or rectum supernatant from each nymph was placed on a 96-well microplate (Costar 96, Corning, NY, USA). To determine proPO activity, 10 μl of sterile PBS 1× pH 7.2 and 5 µl of bovine α-chymotrypsin (1 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) were added. The microplate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. Then, 25 µl of L-DOPA (4 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich) was added and the plate was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. A blank containing 35 µl of sterile PBS 1× pH 7.2 and 5 µl of α-chymotrypsin was included. All samples were analyzed in duplicate.
