 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. In this regard, understanding the interactions between vector insects and the pathogen agents that they transmit to humans is crucial in assessing the future risk posed by these diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Recent projections indicate an increase in the distribution of vector insects and the prevalence of the diseases they transmit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>], considering that insects are ectothermic (i.e. basic physiological functions such as locomotion, growth and reproduction are strongly influenced by environmental temperature) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>] and that higher temperatures will promote shorter life-cycles and more rapid reproduction [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]. While this process cannot be generalized for all ectothermic organisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>], not even for all vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>], it is true that empirical data on insects under controlled conditions are much needed to support theoretical models [
