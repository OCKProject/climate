<p id="Par15" class="p">This study aimed to determine the effect of temperature on the immune response in triatomine-
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> interactions, as assessed by proPO and PO activity, in the AMG, PMG and rectum of 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic>. This species is the vector with the highest epidemiological importance in the transmission of Chagas disease in Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. It can survive in a temperature range of 18–28 °C when infected by 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic>, with 27–28 °C being its optimal range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>]. Considering these temperature ranges, triatomine vectors in our study were bred and kept at 20 °C, 30 °C and 34 °C. The reason for choosing the last temperature was two-fold: first, some climate change scenarios predict an increase of 4 °C above the current temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>]; secondly, previous experiments have indicated that 
 <italic class="italic">M. pallidipennis</italic> does not survive above 34 °C. As an additional variable, infection with two 
 <italic class="italic">T. cruzi</italic> strains was considered in this work. Different isolates and discrete typing units (DTUs) are known to occur in different regions under natural conditions, but it is not clear whether they affect the vector fitness in a differential manner. Increased temperatures are expected to improve triatomine proPO activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>] at the AMG level, while vector survival rates are expected to decrease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. The effect of the different isolates cannot be predicted, but the effects of an isolate type on triatomine survival are expected to remain unaltered under different temperature conditions.
