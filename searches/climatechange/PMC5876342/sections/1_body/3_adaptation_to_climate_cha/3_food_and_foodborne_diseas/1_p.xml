<p id="Par22" class="p">Information is key to effective management of the food system and foodborne disease. Many national surveillance systems (active or passive) for animal and human pathogens are well established and are powerfully linked. These may be supplemented with sentinel surveillance which focuses upon obtaining high-quality data often in selected locations or amongst particular populations. There is also an increasing trend towards coordinated surveillance by supranational agencies such as the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the ECDC and globally through the WHO. This is logical as the distribution of food and movement of people increasingly transcends national boundaries. The primary purpose of surveillance is to determine the presence and levels of pathogens in food, and the corresponding disease burden. This then informs public policy and prevention strategies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>] but also paying particular attention to foodborne pathogens that may alter because of climate change (e.g. pathogens in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) as well as focussing upon food from areas undergoing rapid environmental change. Enhanced molecular surveillance is a further element of increased preparedness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>]. Molecular techniques, especially whole genome sequencing (WGS), support high-resolution tracking and tracing of microorganisms over global scales [e.g. cholera in Haiti; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]] so that emerging trends become noticed in almost real time. WSG also permits the detection of outbreaks that would otherwise likely go unnoticed [e.g. Salmonella Enteritidis in Polish eggs 2017; [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>]]. In addition, preparedness within the food system involves a commitment to large-scale data management and sharing. Initiatives, such as the Global Microbial Identifier [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>] and GenomeTrakr (US Food and Drug Administration initiative to use WGS to support food safety management) support this progression and should help mitigate against climate change with respect to pathogens in food.
