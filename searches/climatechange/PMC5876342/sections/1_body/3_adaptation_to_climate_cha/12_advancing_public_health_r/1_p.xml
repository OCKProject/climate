This requires partnerships between academic institutions and other bodies involved in the food system to conduct studies that support decision-making at all levels of public health. For example, the UK Health Protection Research Unit in Environmental Change and Health (

Such advancement is enhanced through integration of findings across many themes and many individual investigations to translate research into policy and health promotion. There are barriers against this integration, including different representations for uncertainty and reproducibility that are crucial in a decision context. Research that aims to reduce these barriers can be crucial in advancing public health responses to changes in the food system that result from climate change.
