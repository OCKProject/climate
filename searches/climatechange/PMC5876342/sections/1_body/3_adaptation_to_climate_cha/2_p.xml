<p id="Par21" class="p">One key discipline with responsibility for preventing illness associated with foodborne pathogens is public health and preventative medicine. Their duty to prevent illness and to promote health and wellbeing implies a commitment to address climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. The tools and basic concepts of these disciplines provide a blueprint for responding and adapting to climate change, although these may need extending to meet future challenges [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. There are several frameworks categorising how health systems can be made more resilient to climate and climate change [e.g. [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>] (part of the European Action Plan for Strengthening Public Health Capacities)] to the food and public health system and provide specific examples relevant to climate change and foodborne pathogens. Other studies have used similar frameworks but focussed upon a wider range of diseases [e.g. all infectious diseases [
