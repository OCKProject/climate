<p class="p">The present study showed that 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> is a promising source of bioactive phenol which has a good antioxidant activity. The study demonstrated that the total phenolic content and antioxidant activity were higher in 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> plants grown in Northern India in comparison to Southern India. Phytochemical analysis in relation to their activity from different climatic regions can help in selecting places for mass production of this plant species to enhance its pharmaceutical and marketing values. The present work tries to establish a correlation between phytochemicals, TPC and antioxidant activity of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> from different agro-climatic zones of India and have found that climatic zones showed significant effect on all these parameters. Our study emphasizes that north Indian climatic conditions are more suitable for the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic>. Good antioxidant properties of the Aloe could be considered for applications in food, medicine and cosmetic industries.
