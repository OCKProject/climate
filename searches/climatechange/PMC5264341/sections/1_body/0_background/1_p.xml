<p class="p">Climate change is causing noticeable effects on the life cycle, distribution and phyto-chemical composition of the world’s vegetation, including medicinal and aromatic plants. The changing temperatures and wind patterns associated with climate change are affecting precipitation and thereby plant architecture, flowering, fruiting, phyto-chemical composition and in situ competition with other species. India’s climate is largely controlled by an annual monsoon, appears to be experiencing increasingly severe and erratic precipitation. Therefore, there is a need to understand the effect of higher temperature, various precipitation levels and different soil moisture and fertility, by growing them under such climates and determine how variation in temperature, moisture and edaphic factors might affect the plants’ phenology, nutrient, antioxidant and secondary metabolites levels.</p>
