<p class="p">Antioxidants are used to counterbalance the effect of free radicals. An antioxidant is a stable molecule which donates an electron to a charged free radical and terminates the chain reaction before vital molecules are damaged. Free radical scavenging property of antioxidants delays or inhibits cellular damage [

Antioxidants are in great demand as they help in reducing ageing signs. Previously many plants have been screened for their antioxidant potential. Thus, there is growing interest in replacing synthetic antioxidants because of the concern over the possible carcinogenic effects of these in foods with natural ingredients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Primary sources of naturally occurring antioxidants for humans are fruits, vegetables and spices. Medicinal plants contain a wide variety of free radical scavenging molecules such as phenolic compounds (phenolic acids, flavonoids, catechins, proanthocyanidins, quinones, coumarins, tannins etc.), nitrogen compounds (alkaloids, amines, betalains etc.), vitamins, terpenoids, carotenoids and other secondary metabolites which are reported to have antioxidant activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>]. Efforts have been made to search for novel natural antioxidants from tea, fruits, vegetables, herbs, and spices. Herbs are on focus of whole world as a source of novel antioxidants compounds due to their safety as compared to synthetic antioxidants.
