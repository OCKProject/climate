<p class="p">Antioxidative action is one of the prime physiological functions that protect living organisms from oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reactive oxygen species is a term used to describe a number of reactive molecules and free radicals derived from molecular oxygen. During daily activities and with advanced age, oxidative substances and free radicals accumulate in cells affecting various organs and systems in our body. Reactive oxygen and nitrogen species are free radicals that are common outcome of normal aerobic cellular metabolic processes [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. Unbarred generation of these free radicals leads to attack on various biomolecules, cellular machinery, cell membrane, lipids, proteins, enzymes and DNA causing oxidative stress and ultimately cell death [

Overproduction of free radicals can lead to many chronic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, post-ischemic perfusion injury, cardiovascular diseases, myocardial infarction, chronic inflammation, stroke and septic shock, aging and other degenerative diseases in humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>]. Human body has an intrinsic system of various enzymes and nutrients to protect from these free radicals. Some extrinsic nutrients are required by many people who are subjected to higher production of free radicals due to stress or physical activities. Micronutrients like vitamin E, Î² carotene, and vitamin C are the major antioxidants which could be provided in the daily diet as our body cannot produce these nutrients [
