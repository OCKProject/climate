 <italic class="italic">Aloe vera</italic> (syn.: 
 <italic class="italic">Aloe barbadensis</italic> Miller) belongs to the Xanthorrhoeaceae family and is a perennial succulent plant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>]. Out of more than 400 species, only a few species of 
 <italic class="italic">Aloe</italic> have been considered for commercial importance. 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> being the most potent and, thereby, the most popular plant in the research as well as marketing field [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> is a rich source of over 200 naturally occurring nutrients which are water soluble and fat soluble vitamins, minerals, enzymes, polysaccharides, phenolic compounds and organic acids [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>]. Its secondary metabolites have multiple properties such as anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antioxidant, immune boosting, anticancer, anti-ageing, sunburn relief and antidiabetic potentials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Several traditional uses also have been reported such as for burn injury, eczema, cosmetics, inflammation, fever etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. This present study focuses on comparative phytochemical analysis, total phenolic content and antioxidant potential of methanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> from 6 different agro-climatic zones of India. India is a home to an extraordinary variety of climatic regions, ranging from tropical in the south to temperate and alpine in the Himalayan north, where elevated regions receive sustained winter snowfall. These vast climatic variations may cause a difference in the phytoconstituents of the plant species. This study is the first attempt to evaluate antioxidant potential of different 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> accessions from different agro-climatic zones of India.
