<p class="p">In the presence of other chelating agents, the complex formation was disrupted with the result that the red colour of the complex was decreased. Ferrous ions are also commonly found in food systems and considered as prooxidants. Ferrozine form complexes with the ferrous ion, generating a violet color [
