<p class="p">Satisfactory correlations have been reported reported between the parameters of antioxidant activity and the content of total phenols in different in vitro models, with different extracts of plant. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a–e illustrates the linear correlation between total phenols contents and antioxidant activity of different extracts. R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> values were 0.8025, 0.6407, 0.6534, 0.5209, 0.7729 for DPPH free radical scavenging assay, Hydrogen peroxide scavenging assay, Reducing power assay, metal chelating assay and β carotene-linoleic assay respectively. The matrices of linear correlation between total phenolic content and different antioxidant assays were analyzed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref>). They also showed good correlation with respect to each others.
