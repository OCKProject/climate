<p class="p">India is characterized by strong temperature and rainfall variations along with other different environmental and climatic fluctuations in different seasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>]. Phytochemical composition of plants is greatly influenced by different agro-climatic conditions. According to previous findings it was suggested that environmental temperature plays a significant role on antioxidant activity evaluation and it is more pronounced in cold weather [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>]. Therefore, we collected the plant material in the winter season (Jan–Feb 2013). In the present study we also found that the extracts of highland and semi-arid zones possess maximum antioxidant potential. Accessions from Tropical zones showed least antioxidant activity in all assays. 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> can grow in almost all types of environmental conditions but there are several factors that can affect the quality and quantity of a particular constituent. Previous studies state that phytochemical composition of plants is influenced by a variety of environmental factors including the geography, climate, soil type, sun exposure, grazing stress, seasonal changes etc. [
