<p class="p">Report by Sanders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>], describing that an increase in unsaturated fatty acids is generally associated with cooler climates leading to production of antioxidants for a self- defense system against environmental stress, supports our present findings to suggest pronounced effects of environmental temperature on the different 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> extracts. Lower temperature leads to higher production of phenolics and vice versa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">62</xref>]. Plants from hilly areas are thought to be more important from nutritional and dietary points of view [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">63</xref>]. 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> is found to grow in hot humid and high rainfall conditions, so semi- arid conditions having low rainfall are also not favorable for the plant. Although, soil texture and climatic conditions of semi-arid region is normally most suitable for majority of plant crops, 
 <italic class="italic">Aloe</italic> genus however is an exception. In present study, accessions from colder regions showed the good antioxidant activity, supporting the statement that more phytochemicals are produced in plants under stress [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">64</xref>]. Consequently, phytochemical content can vary with growing environmental conditions. From the present work, it could be concluded that agro- climatic locations along with temperature and rainfall have significant effects on the 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> plant phytoconstituents and its antioxidant potential. However, there is still a need to investigate the effects of soil properties and other related biotic and abiotic factors.
