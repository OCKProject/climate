<p class="p">Our study emphasizes the antioxidant potential of 
 <italic class="italic">Aloe vera</italic> methanolic leaf extracts. Previous studies on 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> stated that the plant contains substantial amounts of antioxidants including α-tocopherol (vitamin E), carotenoids, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), flavonoids, and tannins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. Glutathione peroxidase activity, superoxide dismutase enzymes and a phenolic antioxidant were found to be present in 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> gel, which may be responsible for these antioxidant effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Methanolic extract induced the best extraction yield and more complex composition of phenolics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. The methanol extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> were also screened previously for their in vitro antioxidant activity, and extracts exhibited good antioxidant activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. Potent antioxidative compounds like Aloe barbendol, Aloe emodin, barbaloin A and Aloe chrysone have been isolated from methanolic extracts of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic>. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Biological activities of 
 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> may be due to the synergistic action of these compounds, rather than from a single defined component [
