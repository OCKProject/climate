<p class="p">The total phenolic content of the obtained extracts was spectrometrically analyzed by Folin–Ciocalteu method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Gallic acid was used as standard for TPC estimation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. Final volume of 5 ml was made by adding 500 µl of Folin–Ciocalteau reagent, 1.5 ml of 20% Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>CO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and 2 ml of distilled water to 1 ml (1 mg/ml) of each extract. The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30–40 min and the absorbance of the developed colour was recorded at 765 nm using UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Calibration curve was constituted using various concentrations of gallic acid ranging from 20 to 100 µg/ml. Total phenolic value was obtained from the regression equation: y = 0.056x + 1.454 with R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.9967 and expressed as mg/g gallic acid equivalent using the formula, C = cV/M; where C = total content of phenolic compounds in mg/g GAE, c = the concentration of gallic acid established from the calibration curve, V = volume of extract and M = the weight of the extract.
