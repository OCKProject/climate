 <italic class="italic">A. vera</italic> extracts were measured in terms of hydrogen donating radical scavenging ability using the stable DPPH method of Zhu et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>]. The reaction was monitored as a color change from purple to pale yellow. A quantity of 1 ml (1 mg/ml) of 
 <italic class="italic">Aloe vera</italic> extract was added to 2 ml of 0.5 mM DPPH solution in methanol and the reaction mixture was kept in the dark for 45 min. Absorbance was recorded at 517 nm against blank using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer. Ascorbic acid was used as a standard. The radical scavenging activity on DPPH was expressed as,
