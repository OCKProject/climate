<p class="p">The reductive potential of the extract was determined according to the method of Oyaizu [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>]. Extracts and standard ascorbic acid (1 mg/ml) were mixed with 2.5 ml of phosphate buffer (0.2 M, pH 6.6) and 2.5 ml potassium ferricyanide (1% w/v). A quantity of 2.5 ml of chloroacetic acid (10% w/v) was added and the solution was centrifuged for 10 min at 3000 rpm. The upper layer solution of 2.5 ml was separated and mixed with 2.5 ml of distilled water and 0.5 ml of FeCl
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (0.1% w/v). Absorbance was measured at 700 nm. The increase in absorbance of the reaction mixture indicated reducing power of different
