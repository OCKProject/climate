This finding is consistent with other studies on potential geographic shifts in arthropod vectors in response to climate change, which demonstrate that increasing temperatures do not necessarily lead to net increases in geographic disease risk, but rather shifts in distribution as high temperatures decrease habitat suitability [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. While our models do not account for the possibility of vector populations adapting to changing climate, evidence suggests that ectotherms have a limited capacity for exceeding physiological thermal limits [

Localized extinctions would conserve valuable health resources by triggering allocation shifts as unsuitable areas no longer support active disease transmission.
