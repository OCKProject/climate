<p class="p">Based on the results of this study, we conclude that the geographic distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> in Ecuador will be impacted by projected shifts in climate. Extensive changes in modeled vector distributions were observed even under the most conservative climate change scenario, and these changes, although consistent in pattern, became more evident with increasingly high greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. Although there is a continued need for surveillance activities, these findings enable us to anticipate transitioning risk of arboviral diseases in a spatial context throughout Ecuador, allowing for long-term planning of agency vector control strategies.
