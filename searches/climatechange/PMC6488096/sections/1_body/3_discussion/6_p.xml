 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> is a globally invasive species, owing much of its success to its close connection with human activity and urban environments. As such, predicted habitat suitability does not guarantee the introduction and establishment of a species in the future due to a myriad of factors, such as physical and geographical barriers to movement [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. Patterns of human movement and land use also have the potential to influence mosquito expansion in ways that we cannot predict with ENMs. Additionally, microclimate can become a critical factor in determining true habitat suitability, and there are many examples of anthropogenic behaviors and structures providing a buffering effect, or refuge, against climatic conditions that would be otherwise physiologically limiting to insect vectors [
