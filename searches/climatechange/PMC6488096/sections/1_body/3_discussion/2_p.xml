All best model subsets suggest that areas of transitional elevation along the eastern and western peripheries of the Andes mountains may experience some level of increased exposure to the presence of mosquitoes, though much of the mountain range, including densely populated areas like the capital city, Quito, will remain unsuitable habitat. The intrusion of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> into areas of transitioning elevation represents a potential area of concern for public health managers, as communities in these areas are largely protected from mosquito exposure and associated diseases under current climatic conditions. Excluding travel-related cases, reporting of arboviral diseases in Ecuador’s mountain dwelling populations is quite low, although there are low-lying valleys near Quito that may be suitable for arbovirus transmission. Accordingly, the MSP primarily directs mosquito-borne disease outreach and intervention efforts to high-risk communities, particularly in large coastal cities with consistently high disease incidence, such as Guayaquil and Machala. As a result, communities situated in the foothills of the Andes will not necessarily have the same baseline risk perceptions and preventative behaviors as those communities burdened with historically high incidence of mosquito-borne diseases. This sets the stage for potential disparities in preventative knowledge and health services should
