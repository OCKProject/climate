 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> suitability in Ecuador, under current climate conditions, largely reflects present-day risk maps for many of the mosquito-borne diseases currently circulating in the country, wherein populations living at high altitudes are not considered at-risk for transmission [

Predicted larval distributions are roughly continuous in the eastern and western portions of Ecuador, but are sharply restricted along increasing elevation gradients in the central portion of the country, the area corresponding with the location of the Andes mountain range (

This conspicuous absence of mosquitoes in the Andes reflects the generally protective nature of high mountain elevations from mosquito presence, with all models predicting larval mosquito absence throughout central Ecuador (Figs

 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> in the eastern portion of the Amazon basin is notable, as this is a region currently perceived as potentially higher risk for mosquito exposure by public health officials relative to mountainous regions, mostly owing to its low elevation, despite having generally low human population density (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007322.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Although similar in elevation to regions of active disease transmission in the West, the hydrology and seasonal temperature patterns of the Amazon basin differ considerably from coastal areas. Previous work in this region suggests a great deal of spatial variability in the basin with regards to climate patterns, which drive differences in biodiversity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Given that the mosquito life cycle depends heavily on the availability of water in the environment, spatial discrepancies in precipitation could account for the low model agreement of mosquito habitat suitability in the easternmost portion of the Amazon.
