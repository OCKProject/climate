<p class="p">The scale of analysis used in this study presents a limitation in applying resulting ENMs for local management decisions. We chose a moderately low spatial resolution for this study (5km raster cells) to reflect the highest level of precision that could be assigned to larval mosquito occurrence (i.e. points could be matched to cities or clusters of villages, but not to individual households or neighborhoods). Arboviral disease transmission and larval mosquito presence, especially for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>, are typically managed at the household or neighborhood level, and although we can use these results to discuss regional changes in mosquito distribution throughout Ecuador, we cannot overstate the findings as a means to assess risk at the level of disease transmission [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>]. Furthermore, the LI survey conducted by the MSP was limited in that focus was placed on sampling areas with perceived arbovirus transmission risk throughout Ecuador, especially households in densely populated urban centers and established communities where cases had been reported in the past. Low accessibility and human population density in Ecuador’s eastern basin region may have contributed to under sampling of mosquito presence in these areas, possibly accounting for low model agreement in this area. Ultimately, robust vector surveillance for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> in eastern Ecuador would be required to validate absence in this region, though such intensive ground-truthing would be wrought with logistical concerns, including diversion of scarce surveillance resources from high-demand management districts and the inherent difficulty of establishing “true” absence via surveys.
