<p class="p">The model building process was then repeated in DG with the best performing training dataset (i.e. high AUC relative to low omission) to compare full model performance with more parsimonious sets of environmental variables. In addition to variable combinations selected based on previous literature, the GARPTools package was used to extract ruleset trends from the full model (e.g. prevalence and importance of given variables in the resulting model) to assemble additional candidate variable sets for model comparison. The subset of models with the highest AUC and lowest omission (i.e. best model) was chosen as the most probable estimate of current larval mosquito geographic distribution, and rulesets generated from the best model were then projected to the year 2050 for all combinations of GCMs and RCPs. To compare the relative changes in geographic predictions between current and future climate scenarios, the best subsets of current and projected future models for each RCP scenario were recoded as binary geographic distributions (i.e. presence and absence) in ArcMap, where cells with model agreement of ≥ 6 were considered present. Recoded distributions were combined using the ‘Raster Calculator’ tool in the Spatial Analyst extension of the program ArcMap, allowing for the visualization of range agreement across GCMs. The number of people at risk in areas of expanding mosquito distribution, where range expansion was predicted under at least one GCM, was estimated in ArcMap, using the Raster Calculator tool to extract information on GPW and extrapolated population for the year 2050.</p>
