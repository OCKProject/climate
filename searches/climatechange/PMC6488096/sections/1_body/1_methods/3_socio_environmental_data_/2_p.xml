<p class="p">Environmental coverages for estimated future climatic conditions in the year 2050 were taken from forecasted Bioclim variables, allowing for direct comparison between current and future predicted ranges. We chose three general circulation models (GCMs) of physical climate processes commonly used in projecting shifts in species distributions, the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM-1), National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model (CCSM4), and the Hadley Centre Global Environment Model version 2, Earth-System configuration (HADGEM2-ES) under the four standard emissions scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, RCP 8.5) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. To obtain human population for the year 2050, a simple linear extrapolation, wherein we assume a stable rate of growth, was performed on a pixel-by-pixel basis in ArcMap with available years of SEDAC data. Although a rudimentary means of estimating human population growth, the resulting trend mirrors more sophisticated cohort-based population estimates for Ecuador projected for the same time period [
