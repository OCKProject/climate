<p class="p">Environmental coverage datasets for current climatic conditions, comprised of rasterized elevation and 19 derived biophysical variables (Bioclim), were compiled using publicly available interpolated weather station data (WorldClim ver. 1.4.,

WorldClim provides long-term climate averages based on weather station records from 1950–2000, a period coinciding with the start of the MSP’s larval survey. Although more contemporary long-term averages of interpolated climate are available, these datasets have yet to incorporate models of future climate conditions into publicly available products.
