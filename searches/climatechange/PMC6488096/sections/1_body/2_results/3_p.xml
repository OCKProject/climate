Potential distributional shifts were generally consistent across GCMs, with slight range expansions into areas of higher elevation and large portions of the eastern Amazonian basin predicting mosquito absence (Figs

Combining the current and future model agreement rasters for best subset models by RCP revealed predicted areas of geographic stability in western Ecuador and the eastern foothills of the Andes, range contraction throughout much of Amazon basin in the east, and range expansions along transitional elevation boundaries over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007322.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Range expansions and contractions were generally consistent across climate models, with the magnitude of distribution change increasing with more extreme climate change scenarios (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007322.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Similarly, the human population with the potential to experience increased exposure to mosquito presence generally increases with RCP, with an additional 9,473 (RCP2.6), 11,155 (RCP4.5), 10,492 (RCP6.0), and 12,939 (RCP8.5) people currently living in areas of transitional elevation estimated at risk of becoming exposed under different climate change scenarios (
