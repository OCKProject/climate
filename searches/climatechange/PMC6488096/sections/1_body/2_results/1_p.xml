<p class="p">The original dataset of LI occurrences in Ecuador, provided by the MSP, consisted of 3,655 collection events aggregated to 374 parroquia centroids, indicating the number of parroquias that had positive surveillance results for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> larvae during the study period. Disaggregation of these data yielded 478 spatially unique locations within these parroquias, corresponding with areas of human habitation regularly surveyed by the MSP. Incorporating prior knowledge regarding the agencyâ€™s collection of data in developed areas allowed for the adoption of a finer spatial scale for analysis without changing the overall distribution of larval mosquito presence in Ecuador (e.g. mosquitoes remained conspicuously absent in most high-elevation parroquias located in the Andes mountains).
