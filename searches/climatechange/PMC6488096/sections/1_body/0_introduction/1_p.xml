<p class="p">Mosquito-borne disease transmission poses an ongoing challenge to global public health. This is especially true in much of Latin America, where arboviral disease management is complicated by the proliferation of mosquito vectors in tropical conditions, frequently coupled with limited resources for medical care and comprehensive vector control services [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In Ecuador, the yellow fever mosquito (
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>) is of particular medical importance as it is a competent vector for several established and emerging viral diseases, including all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV), chikungunya (CHKV), Zika virus (ZKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV) [
