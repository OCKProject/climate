<p class="p">The present-day distribution of

 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> is broadly defined by regional temperature and precipitation trends, but global climate change has the potential to significantly alter the future geographic range of mosquito vectors [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has established four representative concentration pathways (RCP), or different scenarios for future greenhouse gas emissions, which are the basis for modeling future climates. Even under the most conservative of these scenarios (RCP 2.6), mean global temperatures are projected to increase [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. As temperature trends increase globally, it has been estimated that observed patterns in the distribution of mosquito vectors will shift accordingly; previous studies have projected that 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes will increase their global range as temperature and rainfall patterns become more suitable under various climate change scenarios [

Modeling and visualizing changes in mosquito distributions at the national level will provide a useful tool for managing disease and planning the delivery of health services, as public health resources can be better allocated in anticipation of disease emergence in naïve populations driven by mosquito range expansions.
