 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> typically does very well in heavily urbanized environments, largely due to their reproductive strategy of exploiting small volumes of water in manmade containers around the home as larval habitats [

Situated in northwestern South America, Ecuador exemplifies high landscape diversity, with hot, humid areas of low elevation along the Pacific coast in the west and interior Amazon basin in the east, and the cool, arid Andes mountain range in the central portion of the country (

Historically, the western coastal and interior regions experience a much higher incidence in mosquito-borne diseases than mountainous areas, where sharp increases in elevation and decreases in temperature limit the geographic distribution and vectorial capacity of the mosquito vector.
