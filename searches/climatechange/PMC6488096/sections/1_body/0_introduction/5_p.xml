<p class="p">Ecological niche models (ENMs) have been used to estimate current potential distributions in insect populations, including mosquitoes, as well as range expansions resulting from environmental and climate changes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Ecological niche modeling methodologies have been applied to many systems, spanning regional to global scales, in an effort to estimate 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> distribution and the associated risk of exposure to humans, often indicating that water availability and land cover factor heavily into overall mosquito habitat suitability [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. In Ecuador and other areas of Latin America, elevation also becomes a limiting factor for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> presence, though it is suggested that climate change may allow for the encroachment of mosquitoes into higher elevations [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. While many prior studies have utilized records of adult stages of mosquitoes for ENMs, this study leverages existing larval surveillance data collected in Ecuador as an indicator of species presence, providing a predictive tool about the source of mosquitoes in the environment. This complements predictive models for adult stages, particularly in considering potential for intervention, as it can target larvicidal approaches, rather than reactive adulticidal spraying methods. The Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Production (GARP) is a machine-learning algorithm that builds species ENMs using presence-only occurrence records and continuous environmental variables [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. The genetic algorithm (GA) employed by GARP to build rule-sets for distribution models is stochastic in nature, resulting in a set of models from a single dataset of species occurrence records and allowing for the assessment of agreement between resulting models. This methodology offers a robust option for modeling the potential distribution of species on a landscape from presence-only records, as absence of a species is difficult to discern through historical records and field sampling (e.g. entomological surveys) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. GARP also provides a platform for projecting future climate scenarios onto the landscape with the natively generated rule-sets for species distribution prediction, allowing for the estimation of future geographic distributions [
