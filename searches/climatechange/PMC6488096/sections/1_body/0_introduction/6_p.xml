<p class="p">Assessing current and future vector distributions in an ENM framework is useful for defining the spatial distribution and possible changes in risk exposure, using mosquito presence as a proxy for transmission risk. Previous work in Ecuadorâ€™s southern coast has focused on describing interannual variation in dengue transmission for a single region [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. In this study, we contribute to the available climate-informed tools used by the public health sector in Ecuador to assist decision-making, examining potential geographic shifts in risk at broader spatial and temporal scales. We had three main objectives 1) use an ENM approach to estimate the current geographic range of

 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> range over time, where we hypothesized that larval

 <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> distribution in Ecuador would expand into areas of higher elevation with projected increases in global temperature.
