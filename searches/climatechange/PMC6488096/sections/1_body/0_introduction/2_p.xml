<p class="p">In Ecuador, the Ministry of Health, or Ministerio de Salud PÃºblica (MSP), oversees public health vector control services in the country, including mosquito surveillance, indoor residual spraying, larvicide application, and ultra-low volume (ULV) fogging. The MSP conducts larval index (LI) surveys at the household level, wherein containers of water are sampled for mosquito larvae. Larval indices (e.g. household, container, and Breteau) are among the most common indicators used by public health agencies to establish mosquito presence and quantify abundance, which are key considerations for understanding localized transmission potential and planning larval source reduction [

Although cost effective relative to the delivery of clinical services, mosquito abatement and surveillance activities are nevertheless limited by financial constraints, necessitating informed strategies for focusing resources and personnel [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007322.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. This becomes a critical factor when developing surveillance and control programs on very large scales, such as an entire country, where misdirection of program activities can rapidly deplete program funding. Advancing the understanding of where vectors of interest can occur on the landscape would provide valuable guidance in communicating risk of exposure and avoiding the pitfalls associated with indiscriminately rolling out interventions.
