 <p class="p">The yellow fever mosquito (
  <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic>) is a medically important vector of arboviral diseases in Ecuador, such as dengue fever and chikungunya. Managing 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> is a challenge to public health agencies in Latin America, where the use of limited resources must be planned in an efficient, targeted manner. The spatial distribution of 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> can be used as a proxy for risk of disease exposure, guiding policy formation and decision-making. We used ecological niche models in this study to predict the range of 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic> in Ecuador, based on agency larval mosquito surveillance records and layers of environmental predictors (e.g. climate, elevation, and human population). The best models of current range were then projected to the year 2050 under a variety of greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and models of climate change. All modeled future scenarios predicted shifts in the range of 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">aegypti</italic>, allowing us to assess human populations that may be at risk of becoming exposed to 
  <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> vectored diseases. As climate changes, we predict that communities living in areas of transitional elevation along the Andes mountain range are vulnerable to the expansion of 
  <italic class="italic">Ae</italic>.
