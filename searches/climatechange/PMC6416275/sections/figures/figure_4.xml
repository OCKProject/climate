  <p class="p">Examples of coastal flooding with 0.25 m of sea level rise and storms. These examples illustrate that there are locations with significant flood risks for small amounts of sea level rise when storms are considered. The left hand series of panels depicts projected coastal flood extent during average conditions (i.e. daily/background conditions with spring tide), and the right side select storm scenarios: (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Santa Barbara Municipal Airport, (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Alamitos Bay, Long Beach, and (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Foster City. See Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> for locations. “Disconnected, low-lying flood hazard” designates areas that are below the flood elevation surface but are not hydraulically connected to the flooding due to a flow impediment (e.g. levee), and therefore subject to flooding should the flood barrier fail. See Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> to see the uncertainty range for each of the scenarios. (Figure generated using ArcGIS v. 10.4.2,
