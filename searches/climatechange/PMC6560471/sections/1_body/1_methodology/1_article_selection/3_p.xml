<p id="Par7" class="p">To screen articles, the title and first paragraph of each article was read to determine relevance, with sentences surrounding the “climate change” term in the article read for additional context as needed. Articles about India, indigenous fauna and flora, or pre-historic climate change were excluded, as were articles where climate change was only one of multiple impacts affecting Indigenous peoples. Where no explicit connection to climate change was made, articles about resource extraction and conservation were excluded, resulting in the removal of several dozen articles. Ultimately, 92 articles were selected for analysis.</p>
