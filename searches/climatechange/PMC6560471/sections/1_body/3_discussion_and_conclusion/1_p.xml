<p id="Par31" class="p">As a “public arena,” the media has the potential to shape public understanding of Indigenous issues in a changing climate. While the media can serve as an important forum for Indigenous peoples to challenge dominant narratives (Koch-Baumgarten and Voltmer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2012</xref>), the few studies examining environmental coverage reveal frequent mis- and under-representation of Indigenous peoples (Roosvall and Tegelberg

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2010</xref>). This study examines the content and framing of Indigenous issues within climate change reporting in mainstream newspapers in high-income nations. We document 92 newspaper articles from the last 20 years focusing on Indigenous peoples in a climate change context across Canada, USA, Australia, and New Zealand, with the number of articles published peaking between 2005 and 2009. Several overarching themes emerge and are examined here.
