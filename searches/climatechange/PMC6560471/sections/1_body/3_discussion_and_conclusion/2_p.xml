<p id="Par32" class="p">Firstly, the portrayal of Indigenous peoples as victims of climate change is commonly used to argue for urgency for mitigation action. With coverage of the Inuit human rights case as the epitome, observations and stories provided by numerous Indigenous peoples create compelling personal accounts of the negative consequences of climate change, place climate change as a real and already-occurring phenomenon, and support calls for mitigation measures; these framings echo the role of “intermediaries of urgency” found by Roosvall and Tegelberg (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>). While adaptation actions are profiled across the sample, they are portrayed as isolated incidences and are often used to highlight the difficulty of responding locally to climatic impacts. Thus, Indigenous suffering is used to “sell” the importance of overarching mitigation efforts to the general public, supporting initiatives that do not materially address vulnerabilities of Indigenous communities to climate change. The importance of including Indigenous peoples in mitigation decision-making is ignored by most coverage in the sample.
