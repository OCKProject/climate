<p id="Par38" class="p">While the impact of media coverage on specific communities impacted by climate change has been well-documented (e.g., Callison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>; Marino and Lazrus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2015</xref>), this paper is one of the first to examine the framing and content of reporting on Indigenous issues in national climate change reporting over a broad scale and timeframe. While journalistic norms may have impacted the number of articles returned by the search terms—which focused on the headline, section, and column of the article (See 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>)— this study is a key in developing baseline insights. Key areas for future research include expanding the scope of the search terms; broadening the focus to examine how Indigenous issues in a changing climate are captured in media from low and middle income nations, in media with diverse political leanings, and in local/regional media; examining in greater depth the link between media representation and the perception of the public and decision-makers on Indigenous issues; and focusing more broadly on coverage of environmental issues in general. As the discursive space around Indigenous peoples and climate change continues to grow, and calls for inclusion of Indigenous peoples and perspectives into climate policy-making increase, it is critical to understand the role that the media plays as a “public arena” in shaping these discussions.
