<p id="Par33" class="p">Secondly, limited reference to colonialism, marginalization, and the history of Indigenous communities in the articles reviewed decontextualizes Indigenous experiences and silences the role of broader sociopolitical factors within which vulnerability to climate change is created and sustained (Cameron 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2012</xref>; Ford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2012</xref>). This omission narrows the types of responses discussed in articles and frames, with articles rarely highlighting the importance of addressing underlying structural root causes of vulnerability. In this way, climate change is constructed as problem 
 <italic class="italic">for</italic> society as opposed to a problem 
 <italic class="italic">of</italic> society, mirroring broader scientific discourse around Indigenous peoples and climate change (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2016a</xref>), and obscuring colonizationâ€™s tangible impact on mitigation and adaptation responses (Callison 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2014</xref>; Marino and Lazrus 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2015</xref>).
