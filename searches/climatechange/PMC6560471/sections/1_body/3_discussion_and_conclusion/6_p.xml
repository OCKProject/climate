<p id="Par36" class="p">Fourthly, the differences in volume, timing, content, and tone of coverage across the four nations are striking. Disparities in volume of coverage, and particularly the lack of Australian coverage, could be indicative of differences in the journalistic norms of national newspapers, or of national interest in the subject (See 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>). However, higher volumes of Canadian coverage may also be consistent with findings that Canada has one of the highest national news shares for climate change coverage as a whole (Stoddart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">2015</xref>), in addition to the higher relevance of Arctic impacts as the region most dramatically impacted by climate change. Interestingly, the tone of coverage is drastically different in coverage of “foreign” communities. In New Zealand and Australia, coverage of Inuit experiences of climate change is much more sympathetic in tone than in “domestic” coverage, and coverage of Indigenous communities in the Amazon by American newspapers discussed the need for greater incorporation of Indigenous peoples in climate negotiations, a claim that is never made in American “domestic” coverage.
