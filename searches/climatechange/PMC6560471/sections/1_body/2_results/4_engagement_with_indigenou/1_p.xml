 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2012</xref>)—in understanding and responding to climate change is well studied in academic literature (Nakashima et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2012</xref>). Throughout the articles reviewed, the role of Indigenous or traditional knowledge (IK/TK) in addressing climate change was widely documented. Almost twice as many impacts were identified by IK/TK as by Western or scientific knowledge (70 vs. 42 instances). In approximately 40% (16/41) of the articles where IK/TK identified impacts, impacts were also characterized by scientific knowledge. Impacts identified by IK/TK were predominantly ongoing sociocultural or health/safety impacts, while ecological and economic impacts in the immediate and long-term were generally identified by Western systems of knowledge.
