<p id="Par22" class="p">When discussing responsibility for the severity of climate change impacts, and for impacts of subsequent responses, responsibility was evenly attributed to Indigenous communities and developed nations (18 articles vs. 17). However, the content of assigned responsibility varied significantly. When discussing the culpability of developed nations, articles targeted a generalized notion of industrialized society. The first attribution of responsibility for climate change is found in a series of articles covering an unsuccessful lawsuit launched by Inuit against the USA in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, arguing that the USA’s failure to ratify Kyoto was directly linked to the destruction of the Inuit way of life (Watt-Cloutier

In contrast, articles assigning responsibility to Indigenous communities tended to focus on specific individuals, communities, or groups (e.g., hunters); for example, one journalist wrote that “Southern researchers can find themselves denied permission to work in specific northern regions if their findings could result in legal limitations to local resource use,” implicitly suggesting Inuit communities were responsible for endangering polar bear populations by resisting hunting bans (Friis-Baastad

While the responsibility of “industrialized society” is discussed in abstract of concrete solutions, the discussion of Indigenous vulnerability to climate change is always contextualized by discussion of tangible alternatives (e.g., relocation into larger cities, acceptance of quotas), implicitly suggesting Indigenous communities are responsible for the severity of climate change impacts that they experience.
