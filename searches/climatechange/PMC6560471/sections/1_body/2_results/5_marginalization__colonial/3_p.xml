<p id="Par21" class="p">Discussions of marginalization were far more frequent and substantive than discussions of colonization, with 45% of articles (41/92) referencing marginalization. These articles discussed political marginalization (i.e., exclusion from decision-making processes), economic marginalization (i.e., unemployment, lack of access to institutional funding), and social marginalization (i.e., racism, unsafe living conditions). While some articles explicitly linked marginalization with heightened vulnerability to climatic impacts, marginalization was rarely historically contextualized, with few articles or individuals discussing the need to address such underlying conditions in responding to climate change. Few explicit links between a lack of government support and ongoing marginalization are made.</p>
