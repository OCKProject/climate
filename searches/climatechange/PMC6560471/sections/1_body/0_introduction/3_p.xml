 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2011</xref>), yet very little of this work has focused on newspaper coverage of Indigenous peoples. Exceptions include studies of the localized impact of coverage (Huntington

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">2015</xref>) analysis of coverage of Indigenous issues at the Copenhagen climate summit (COP15), and Walter’s (

In light of this dearth of scholarship, this paper identifies and examines the coverage and framing of Indigenous issues in climate change reporting in mainstream newspapers in high-income nations.
