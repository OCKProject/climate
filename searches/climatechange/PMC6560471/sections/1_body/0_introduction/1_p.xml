<p id="Par2" class="p">Indigenous peoples are widely acknowledged as uniquely sensitive to the impacts of climate change; many Indigenous communities inhabit regions that are already experiencing rapid changes in temperature, weather patterns, and species distributions, with impacts exacerbated by legacies of economic, social, and political marginalization and colonization (Ford

Efforts to address climate change through adaptation and mitigation are essential, yet there is concern that such actions could perpetuate marginalization and increase vulnerability if they do not reflect the worldviews, needs, and rights of Indigenous peoples (Ford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2016b</xref>). Such concern is underpinned by an absence of Indigenous voices in research, policy, and decision-making around climate change at local to global scales (Ford et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2016</xref>). Despite this neglect, in recent years, there has been increasing recognition in the global arena of the unique sensitivity of Indigenous peoples, the need to respect Indigenous rights in climate policy, and the importance of Indigenous knowledge systems in responding to climate change, evident in the text of the Paris Agreement and discourse within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (Ford et al.
