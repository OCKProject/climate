This is notably true for health impacts, making climate change a risk multiplier for gender-based health disparities. Both men and women are at risk for amplified health impacts. Women have distinct health needs, such as nutritional demands during pregnancy, which places them at risk of suffering from climate-sensitive diseases. Men experience other risks, such as suicide and severe depression in the face of drought [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and resulting agricultural losses, and may be at higher risk of drowning during severe weather [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Compounding women&#x02019;s health vulnerabilities are cultural constructs, which amplify risk on a regional scale. Globally, a total of 1.3 billion people in low- and middle-income countries live below the poverty line, and 70% are female [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Yet while the interactions between poverty, gender-based social discrimination, and climate change threaten to amplify gender-based health disparities, women&#x02019;s social roles and potential for agency afford opportunities for promoting solutions to sustainability, disaster risk reduction, and solutions to health threats. Ensuring that policies move beyond traditional separations of health, gender, and environment and embrace proactive and gender-based solutions is paramount to protecting women&#x02019;s health and mobilizing their vast social potential to mitigate, adapt to, and respond to climate threats.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Health impacts</title><p>Climate change affects health through a multitude of mechanisms, including heat, poor air quality, and extreme weather events, as well as through meteorological changes that alter vector-borne disease, reduce water quality, and decrease food security [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The health risks associated with these exposure pathways are mediated through physiologic, cultural, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities, which differ substantially between men and women (<xref rid="pmed.1002603.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The lack of gender-disaggregated health data restricts conclusive understanding of thresholds of exposure for harm and may result in a lack of awareness by local, national, and even global decision makers and healthcare personnel.

however, achieving the integration of policies, surveillance, and program creation and implementation necessary to make progress in solving these interrelated issues has proven challenging. For example, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) contain separate targets for poverty (SDG 1), gender equality (SDG 5), sustainability (SDG 11), and climate action (SDG 13). Opportunities to interconnect these separate targets through subtargets and indicators that bridge sectors were largely lost during the development of the SDGs. Thus, while there are energy-related indicators in the health goal (related to household use of biomass fuels), there are no health-related indicators in the energy or climate goals. Disaggregation and failure to explicitly link health with these other goal areas leads to discordant efforts, inefficiencies, and communication barriers between involved agencies tasked with solving these multisectoral problems.</p><p>Similarly, some advances have been made within the UNFCCC and the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR). UNFCCC decision 21/CP.22 (2017) calls for a &#x0201c;gender action plan&#x0201d; to incorporate a gendered perspective in all elements of mitigation, adaptation, capacity, technology, and finance. Although this framework sets the stage for action, systematic integrative procedures are lacking, as are indicators to monitor progress. The Sendai Framework&#x02014;an international covenant adopted in 2015 to establish common goals and standards for disaster risk reduction&#x02014;formalizes climate change as a disaster-risk multiplier to women and recognizes women as important stakeholders in risk reduction [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, it calls on adopters to &#x0201c;prepare, review and periodically update preparedness policies, plans and programmes with the involvement of all relevant institutions, considering climate change scenarios and their impact, and to facilitate the participation of all sectors and stakeholders&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Strong accountability is fundamental to the framework, which contains 38 indicators to track progress in implementing the 7 targets, which aim to reduce disaster mortality and damage to critical infrastructure and economies through increased multihazard early-warning systems, improved national and local mitigation strategies, and enhanced international cooperation. The framework also incorporates the related dimensions of SDGs related to poverty, sustainability, and climate action. The Sendai Framework Monitor will also function as a management tool to help countries develop disaster risk reduction strategies, make risk-informed policy decisions, and allocate resources to prevent new disaster risks. It will also target disaggregated data collection with formal biannual reporting via the Sendai Framework Monitoring Process.</p></sec><sec id="sec005"><title>Towards integration</title><p>Gender mainstreaming throughout all climate targets has been recognized by the UNFCCC as critical to increasing effectiveness. Women play a vital role in the societal response to climate change; their participation at all levels has been shown to result in greater responsiveness to citizens&#x02019; needs and often increases in cooperation across party and ethnic lines, generally resulting in sustainable outcomes [<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1002603.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

The need for compliance with the monitoring processes advocated by the SDGs and the Sendai Framework are critical to address the complex interactions between poverty, gender-based social discrimination, and climate change that threaten to amplify gender-based health disparities. To support monitoring, effective mechanisms to gather and analyze data are needed. Women&#x02019;s distinct social roles and potential for agency afford opportunities for promoting effective solutions to sustainability, disaster risk reduction, and solutions to health threats. High-level political engagement with the implementation of the UN landmark agreements is necessary to ensure that policies and programs move beyond traditional separations of health, gender, and environment and embrace proactive and gender-based solutions that protect women&#x02019;s health.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Kevin Blanchard of Public Health England for his important contributions to this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other" id="fn001"><p><bold>Provenance:</bold> Commissioned; not externally peer reviewed</p></fn></fn-group><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CNS</term><def><p>central nervous system</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SDG</term><def><p>Sustainable Development Goal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNFCCC</term><def><p>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>UNISDR</term><def><p>United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pmed.1002603.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
