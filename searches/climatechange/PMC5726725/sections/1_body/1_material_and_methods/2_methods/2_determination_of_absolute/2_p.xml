<p class="p">The Theil-Sen estimate is then used to assess the long-term trends over the analysis period, per grid cell. The Theil-Sen estimate is a linear trend measure that is relatively robust against non-normal data and outliers, where the change (trend) in a time series is expressed as the median slope 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> obtained from all possible combinations of two values in the time series [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. To estimate this median slope 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>, the time series 1901–2000 derived for each grid cell has been pre-whitened using Zhang's method [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and de-autocorrelated; missing data values were not present in the data. Subsequently, the long-term trends in the form of the median slope 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> have been determined [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>], as implemented in the R package "zyp" [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. A non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) test for the absence (H
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>) or presence (H
 <sub class="sub">A</sub>) of a significant monotonic (linear or non-linear) trend was conducted simultaneously. This allows identifying significant trends. Similar to the Theil-Sen estimate, the MK test procedure is quite robust against (non-normal) data with outliers. Both methods are commonly used for analysing hydro-meteorological time series [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>].
