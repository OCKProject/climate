<p class="p">To determine long-time temperature trends, this study makes use of gridded monthly mean terrestrial surface air temperature data (in °C) for the years 1901–2014 [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Long-term trends in the total monthly precipitation (in mm) are assessed using the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) Full Data Reanalysis dataset for the years 1901–2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Both datasets have been chosen due to the available length of the time series, and their comparatively high spatial resolution of 1/2° x 1/2°, which is identical for both datasets. This high spatial resolution makes both datasets better suited for the scope of this case study when compared to datasets with a coarser resolution, and also facilitates the integration of both datasets, e.g., by avoiding resampling of grid values. Moreover, both datasets are also well suited for this study due to their global coverage and completeness, thus avoiding missing data.
