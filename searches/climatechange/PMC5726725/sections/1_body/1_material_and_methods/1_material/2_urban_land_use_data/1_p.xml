<p class="p">A gridded urban land-use dataset with a resolution of 1/6° x 1/6° has been derived on a global scale from the HYDE 3.1 land-use database [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] to approximate the age, total spatial extent, and variability of the spatial extent of urban areas for the period 1900–2000. A spatially explicit model of urban development has been proposed on the basis of these indicators [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. From this model, the concept of “maturity” of urban land is of interest for the case made in this paper. Maturity can be understood as the relationship between the age of urban land and its spatial and demographic “stability”. It is conceptualized using local indicators of spatial association (LISA), i.e., four clusters representing spatial autocorrelation [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Matured cities are considered as stable, i.e., lacking substantial large-scale urban growth; this refers to both their spatial extent and their population, either growing relatively slowly or being in stagnation or decline [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Many European core cities fall in this category. Less matured cities, on the other hand, could be referred to as unstable, i.e., still experiencing (rapid) population growth in conjunction with a high variability of their spatial extent due to often fast-paced and tremendous spatial expansion. Cities in developing countries are typical examples of this category.
