<p class="p">The assessed trends and proposed measure of climate change “magnitude” will additionally be put into context with a spatially explicit model of urbanization, that elicits different states of urban development. These states include, e.g., rapidly developing, comparatively young cities that are characterized by extensive spatial extension and large population growth as well as relatively old cities that are spatially and demographically stagnating [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], this model of urbanization also shows that hotspots of urbanization are predominantly located in the Global South [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In these developing countries, it is more likely that governance performs poorly due to factors such as a lack of efficiency, lack of economic or democratic freedom and widespread corruption. Thus, these countries are not able to meet the demands of sustainable planning and risk management [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. In this paper, as outlined above, it will be shown that these cities may also be hotspots of climate change where the demand for scientific knowledge to support adaptation is high. In so doing, we make a case for the need to co-manage urbanization and climate change.
