<p class="p">Of these various hazards, water scarcity, drought, flooding and heatwaves are considered the primary climate change-related threats for the urban space [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Water scarcity and drought can be considered as long-term stresses, that are likely to be exacerbated by climate change. Both conditions can already frequently be observed in many cities, e.g., in the large urban agglomerations of California and Arizona [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. On the contrary, short-term shocks, such as extreme weather events, can be shown to be further exacerbated by the unique characteristics of urban space [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. For example, the large areas of ground that are impervious to groundwater penetration in cities and their hinterland may contribute to flooding after heavy precipitations events. Cities in low-lying, coastal areas are also at risk of coastal flooding. In addition, extreme temperatures during heat spells or heatwaves may be further exacerbated by urban heat islands [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Climate change may thus exacerbate both hydrological risks—i.e., risk of riverine and coastal flooding—as well as climatological/meteorological risks such as the risk of excess temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. In this context, it needs to be noted that this paper considers the aforementioned shocks and stresses, i.e., types of natural hazards, as manifestations of climate change, or as the impacts of climate change, respectively, and these are in turn conceptualized as observed trends in various selected indicators.
