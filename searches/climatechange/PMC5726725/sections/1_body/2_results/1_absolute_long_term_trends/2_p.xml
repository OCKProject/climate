 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). In accordance with IPCC, particularly strong warming is observed in the higher latitudes, with temperature increases exceeding 4.5Â°C for parts of the arctic region [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. A comparatively high increase in mean surface air temperature has also been estimated along a band stretching from the Baltics to the Russian Pacific coast. Cooling is estimated substantially less frequent, and is mainly observed in the South-Eastern United States, the Southern Balkan and small patches across Africa and the Middle East, China, South-East Asia and Australia [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref> depict this general pattern, with a significant decline of precipitation in Northern (Saharan) Africa, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Latin America and across the Andes, the Balkan, as well as Central and South-East Asia.
