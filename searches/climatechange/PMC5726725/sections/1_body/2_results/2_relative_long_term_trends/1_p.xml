<p class="p">The relative change per grid cell, i.e., the estimated 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century trend relative to the 1901–1931 baseline, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>. The general patterns here match the estimated absolute trends depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>. However, it becomes clear that cooling, in regard to the baseline, is only of small magnitude, whilst warming is considerably stronger, with highest increases equating to as much as 26% and higher. It is also interesting to note that increases of surface air temperature in Fennoscandia and North-Western Russia were mostly not significant at the 10% level. However, the corresponding relative changes are notable despite the non-significance of the modelled trends. Conversely, the significant increases in temperature that were modelled for Southern Africa and Central America, estimated on the higher end of the absolute scale, correspond to comparatively small increases in relative terms. Regarding precipitation, particularly the extreme increases—e.g., Northern and North-Western Russia and Southern Brazil—and decreases—e.g., North Africa and the Chinese Tibetan Plateau—correspond to the highest changes in both absolute as well as relative terms.
