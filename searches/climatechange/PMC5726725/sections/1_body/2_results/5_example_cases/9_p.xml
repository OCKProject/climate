<p class="p">In Barreiras, the estimated relative change in precipitation is about -5.1% (p &gt; 0.10), and in mean surface air temperature approximately +2.7% (p &lt; 0.10). The relative changes estimated for the city of Palmas are -11.6% and +1.5%, respectively, with p &lt; 0.10 for both parameters. The corresponding magnitude of change for Barreiras is

In line with these findings, also the mean daily maximum temperature of heat days has increased, thus underlining the potentially increasing drought risk and risk of desertification. Our findings indicate overall declining trends in the remaining heat indicators, however, and similarly to Barstow, with observations above the estimated trend in the late 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. This also holds true for Brasília, Brazil’s capital region located in the 
 <italic class="italic">Distrito Federal</italic> (DF), Brazil’s Federal District. The DF is another example of water scarcity induced by overstraining natural resources due to the intensification of agriculture, urbanization and population growth. In the DF, expansion of intensive agriculture and urban sprawl have caused severe losses of native savanna vegetation (
 <italic class="italic">cerrado</italic>) and put an enormous pressure on the region’s water resources [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. Since the late 1970s, river basins show a dramatic decrease of base flow discharge by 40–70%, presumably due to irrigation [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The situation in the DF is pressing, since 94% of the population lives in urban areas, where system capacities for water supply are already close to their limits. Water demand will continue to increase in the near future, with the population projected to grow from currently 2.5 Mio to 3.2 Mio in 2025 [
