<p class="p">A risk of increasing drought is also estimated for North Africa, West Africa and the Sahel (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). More than 40 percent of Africans live in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub-humid areas. The amount of water available per capita in Africa is already far below the global average and is continuously declining—with annual per capita availability of 4,000 cubic meters compared to a global average of 6,500 cubic meters [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Drought is endemic to many African regions and repeated drought cycles killed thousands of people. In addition, the groundwater table is lowered and rainfall is declining in many regions [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. For example, in Sudan, in line with our findings, changes in climate parameters are summarized by reduced precipitation, warming, solar dimming, increasing evapotranspiration, intensifying aridity and an increasing recurrence of drought events [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. For Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, relative changes over the 20

Khartoum also faces an increase in heat; in line with the long-term trend in surface air temperature, the number of heat days per year, as well as the mean maximum daily temperature of heat days, increased significantly over the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. The frequency of heat spells per year increased accordingly (
