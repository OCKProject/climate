<p class="p">Clearly, as discussed earlier and as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>, increasing precipitation in combination with increasing surface air temperatures is one of two dominant directions of change. Due to the excessive warming and the increase in precipitation in higher latitudes, urban areas located there are mainly affected by this combination of trends. Here, hydrological risk, i.e., risk of flooding, will likely increase for the urban land [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. As mentioned earlier, this flood risk may be exacerbated in low-lying regions, which are not only affected by riverine flooding, but also coastal flooding due to sea-level rise. For this, the Netherlands is a prime example. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref> indicates that warming and an increase of precipitation is observed for many Dutch cities over the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. National and communal policies anticipate this trend to continue [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]; amongst other measures, adaptation strategies include an increase of retention capacities and the strengthening of coastal defences to avoid riverine and coastal flooding (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Long experiences with flooding and water management help to devise and implement these strategies. Older cities such as Rotterdam, with nearly 80% of the city below sea level and one of the largest ports in the world, have gained centuries of disaster and water management experience. Moreover, it is the maturity of comparable cities—i.e., their relatively low population growth or possibly stagnating or declining population, in combination with comparatively low rates of spatial expansion and the application of good governance principles [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]—that fosters the implementation of adaptation measures. In this study, it is estimated that in Rotterdam, during the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century, the mean annual surface air temperature increased by approximately 3%, and precipitation by about 10%, with

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0189451.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Regarding heat, Rotterdam’s adaptation strategies need to focus on an increase in the overall number of (non-consecutive) heat days and both an increasing number as well as an increasing duration of heat spells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>), although there is a substantial variability over the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century that hampers the assessment of a clear trend. Moreover, although the number of heat days per has increased, there are indications of declining mean daily maximum temperatures of these heat days (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). This could facilitate heat adaptation strategies (
