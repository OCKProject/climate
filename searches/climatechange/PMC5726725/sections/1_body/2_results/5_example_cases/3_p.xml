<p class="p">Adaptation challenges for the cities of Surat or Daman, both located at India’s west coast, are similar in principle, with the direction of change being equivalent to Rotterdam or Utrecht, and thus likely facing increasing hydrological risks, i.e., sea-level rise and more frequent flooding, but also heat [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. For Surat, this is expected despite the comparatively low increases in surface air temperature of about 2% (p &lt; 0.10), and of about 3% in precipitation (p &gt; 0.10). Consequently, on a global scale, Surat might be considered as only slightly affected by climate change with

From 1961 to 2001, the population increased tenfold to approximately 2.4 Mio people, with a decadal growth rate of 93% in the period 1981–1991, and 62.4% in the period 1991–2001 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]; the population is projected to reach 8.5 Mio in 2031. Similarly, the city experienced rapid spatial expansion, from 8.12 km² (1961) to 326.5 km² in 2009 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. Unregulated urban growth resulted in urban developments within flood-prone areas with a subsequent restriction of water flow. Implementing adaptation measures and lessons learned from past experiences of flooding—between 1949 and 1979, Surat was flooded approximately once every four years [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]—is substantially hampered by this rapid development. Also regarding heat, Surat faces increased risks, which may severely affect human well-being and human health. Although the average heat spell duration is stagnating, and thus not showing a clear trend, Surat faces an increase of (non-consecutive) heat days, individual heat spells and daily maximum temperatures as risk factors (
