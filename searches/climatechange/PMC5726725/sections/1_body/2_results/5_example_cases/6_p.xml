<p class="p">Heat trends are difficult to detect for these cities. Neither heat indicator shows a clear trend, but a high variability can be observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g006" class="xref">Fig 6</xref>). However, the number of (non-consecutive) heat days per year and the number of heat spells per year remained above the estimated linear trends at the end of the 20
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century. For this period, also the mean daily maximum temperatures of heat days have been increasing. This coincides with severe drought conditions repeatedly experienced in this region. Starting approximately in the 1990s, large parts of the South-Western United States, and in particular the South of California, started to encounter exceptional drought conditions [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>]. Both reservoirs feed large urban agglomerations, e.g., the rapidly growing Phoenix metropolitan area with an approximate population of 4.5 Mio in 2015, and projected 6.8 Mio in 2040 and 7.7 Mio in 2050 [
