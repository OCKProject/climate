<p class="p">As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A</xref>, trends corresponding to increasing precipitation but decreasing surface air temperature are observed substantially less frequent globally. This combination of trends will most likely affect flood risk, e.g., due to more severe extreme precipitation events or coastal flooding due to sea-level rise. The related challenges for managing these hydrological risks are likely similar to the previously explored cases (
