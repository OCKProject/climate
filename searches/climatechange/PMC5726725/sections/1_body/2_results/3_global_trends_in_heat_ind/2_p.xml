<p class="p">Taking also the direction of change into account, a positive (negative) association exists between positive (negative) long-term temperature trends and positive (negative) trends in both the number of heat days and heat spells. For quadrant I, the corresponding phi correlation coefficient, determined using crosstabs statistics, is equal to 
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">I</italic>
 </sub> = 0.604. For observations in quadrant II, phi is equal to 
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">II</italic>
 </sub> = 1.000, i.e., positive (negative) long-term trends are matched by corresponding positive (negative) trends in heat indicators. In quadrant III, phi is 
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">III</italic>
 </sub> = 0.846, and in quadrant IV it is 
 <italic class="italic">φ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">IV</italic>
 </sub> = 0.753 (all correlations are significant at the 1% level). Consequently, significant increases of (non-consecutive) heat days per year tend to result in a significantly increasing number of heat spells per year. The global patterns of trends in both heat indicators are shown in
