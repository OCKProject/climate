<p class="p">Firstly, regarding the elicited directions of change, we have shown that warming has been observed as a very likely trend (p &lt; 0.10) for the vast majority of global urban land, i.e., for 94.7% of grid cells that are classified as urban. Looking at the combined trends of warming and very likely trends in mean annual total precipitation (p &lt; 0.10), it can further be concluded that approximately three quarters of global urban land faces trends of increasing precipitation. As shown in

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0189451.g007" class="xref">Fig 7A</xref>, urban areas affected by increasing temperatures and wetter conditions are mostly located in Northern and Western Europe, North America, Northern and Central Asia, and South America. Warmer and drier conditions are primarily found in urban areas in Central America, Northern Africa and the Sahel, Eastern Europe, and, to some extent, South-East Asia. By additionally considering the observed trends in heat indicators, it has furthermore been shown that these urban areas are also increasingly affected by heat extremes.
