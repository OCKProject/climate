<p class="p">Clearly, the conclusions drawn above rely heavily on the reliability and accuracy of each of the underlying data sources. Here, possible errors arise from stochastic sampling error as a result of heterogeneous data density across the globe, as well as from the interpolation of measurements to gridded surfaces [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. These errors apply to all climate datasets used. To reduce uncertainty in modelled precipitation, particular care was taken to check for the plausibility of extreme values [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. The relative error in gridded monthly precipitation is estimated to be between ±7 to 40% of the true mean precipitation in regions in which 5 stations were used for interpolation, and between ±5 to 20% in regions with denser data. If less observations are available for interpolation, the results are less certain. This is the case with results in regions of lower certainty like parts of Northern and Central Africa, South America, Siberia, Central Asia and Australia. However, margin of error also reflects the natural variability in precipitation at a given location, and is thus greater when natural variability is higher [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Regarding surface air temperature, it is expected that there is less certainty in summer compared to winter, with the overall error range being comparable to the range of error of a 2- to 4-day numerical weather prediction and still below overall climatological variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. There is, however, considerable uncertainty particularly in the tropics and the southern hemisphere for the period before 1935 [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. This could explain the observed patterns of relatively sharp decreases of heat days, heat spells and heat spell duration for the Brazilian cases, and thus the rather unexpected linear 20
