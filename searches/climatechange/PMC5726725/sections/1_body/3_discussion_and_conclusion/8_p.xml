<p class="p">Moreover, any of the hazards and risks associated with the observed climate trends—in particular heat extremes, water scarcity, and drought—have further implications for the socioeconomic development of cities. For example, threatening the health and well-being of urban dwellers, their food security, as well as the energy and resource security of the urban economy [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. It has also been shown that urban expansion further exacerbates climatological risks in which a scarcity of water is not only a result of a lack of supply due to a deficit of precipitation, but also a consequence of increasing residential, economic and agricultural demand, especially in conditions of warming [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Despite urban expansion, water demand is also dependent on urban topology. It has been shown that dispersed, low-density (suburban) housing, typical of urban sprawl, is associated with higher domestic water consumption in comparison to compact, high-density developments [

 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. In either case, increasing demands for freshwater can ultimately deplete an ecosystem’s ability to provide services and additionally impact human health and regional-to-global migration. This can lead to calls for more sustainable water management [
 <xref rid="pone.0189451.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>], but also underlines the need for an effective management of urbanization. Hence, making a case for co-managing urbanization and climate change is particularly needed in the aforementioned areas of the Global South in order to reduce hindrances and barriers to adaptation. Consequently, the assessment of adaptation gaps should also consider such a co-management of driver processes.
