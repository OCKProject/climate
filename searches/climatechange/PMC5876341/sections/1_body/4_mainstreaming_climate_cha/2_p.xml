<p id="Par32" class="p">National Adaptation Programmes of Action (NAPAs) are climate change adaptation plans undertaken by Least Developed Countries under the UNFCCC, providing vital information on vulnerability and adaptation challenges. The NAPAs are thus a key source of information in determining the distribution of funding, which is allocated principally based on assessed vulnerability. However, as the quality of NAPAs is variable and the extent to which NAPAs incorporate health is often limited, public health outcomes are not necessarily fully accounted for when funding decisions are made; for instance, only one in four NAPAs include a comprehensive health vulnerability assessment, despite this being a key stipulation under the UNFCCC [

The NAP process aims to support medium- and long-term adaptation planning for all countries, and acts as a vital means of identifying funding needs and adaptation priorities [

Whilst historical engagement from the health sector in the development of the NAPs has been minimal, the World Health Organization (WHO) is increasingly successful in supporting countriesâ€™ (most especially low- and middle-income countries) to develop robust Health National Adaptation Plans (HNAPs). Improved public health participation in these processes should work to increase their access to adaptation funding (which has so far been concerningly low, compared with other sectors) and so contribute to mainstreaming adaptation throughout the health sector [
