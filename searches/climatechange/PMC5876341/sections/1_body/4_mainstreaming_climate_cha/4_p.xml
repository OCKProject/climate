<p id="Par34" class="p">These high level considerations clearly form vital components to mainstreaming climate change adaptation into public health practice, and indeed provide the enabling mechanisms to adapt, but ultimately, it is on-the-ground actions that show the true extent to which mainstreaming is effective and thus help build the evidence base of why such plans and funding are needed. One area where significant progress has been made in mainstreaming climate change adaptation into public health practice is the provision of effective forecasting of health-relevant weather and climate risks; this is a key element of the BRACE framework and hence integral to health adaptation. Such health-tailored climate services are not only being increasingly recognised for their importance, but they are also being deployed evermore through partnerships between meteorological and health organisations. These climate services are helping public health practitioners to improve the ability of health services to detect, monitor, predict, and manage health risks associated with climatic changes. There are important tangible benefits to using these services, including reduced deaths and numbers affected by climate and weather-related events; more efficient and effective use of resources; and decreased strain on health delivery systems, via better planning and increased awareness and preparedness of climate and weather health risks. While potentially hugely beneficial, the deployment of climate services for public health practice is complex and context-specific. Some key considerations, which should help to promote the most effective use of climate services in public health practice, include: creating an enabling environment between health and meteorological services; building the capacity of these services; researching how climate services are most effective for public health in a given context; developing appropriately tailored climate services; applying these services into real public health practice; and finally evaluating the effectiveness of the climate services used to promote learning and improvement [
