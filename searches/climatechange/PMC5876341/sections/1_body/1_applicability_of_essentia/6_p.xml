<p id="Par13" class="p">Building upon the ten essential public health services presented above (and their translation to climate change adaptation), it is important to consider what principles characterise an effective approach. Frumkin, Hess, and Luber argue that there are seven key characteristics of the ideal public health response to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>•]. Firstly, and perhaps most demandingly, it must have its foundations in a robust public health system, able to deliver core health services across its whole population. Secondly, any response requires clear understanding of the nature of the environmental hazards, to ensure they are robust and effectively and efficiently reduce health risks associated with climate change. Thirdly, “all-hazard preparedness” should be prioritised, ensuring a system is able to cope with all climate hazards. Fourthly, health systems should emphasise resilience, stressing the need for building strong communities and systems with the ability to cope with unpredictable stressors. Fifthly, any potential co-benefits in addressing climate change should be maximised; for example, ecosystem-based adaptation can have mental health benefits in exposing people to ecosystem services. Sixthly, strong and cross-sectoral partnerships are essential, both for climate data provision and interpretation for the health sector, but also because climate change will impact a range of sectors and risk factors, all of which must respond in order safeguard public health. Lastly, adaptive management, which focuses on institutional learning and constant evaluation, should be promoted [
