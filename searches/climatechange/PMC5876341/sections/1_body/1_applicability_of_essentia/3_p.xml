<p id="Par10" class="p">Existing classifications of public health services—such as the distinction of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention—can be helpfully applied to climate change adaptation, and can in turn, be used as guidelines for integrating adaptation into public health practice. Primary prevention is associated with the prevention of disease onset. Secondary prevention works to reduce the body-wide impacts diseases can have, through treatment to prevent further and more severe risks in future. Tertiary prevention aims to reduce the social and physical impacts of diseases and their symptoms, to best ensure people can maintain a good quality of life. These three principles directly relate to climate change responses. Primary prevention involves reducing population exposures to climate change; secondary prevention is concerned with the avoidance of adverse health outcomes given inevitable exposure; and tertiary prevention decreases long-term, and more systemic health impacts of climate change [
