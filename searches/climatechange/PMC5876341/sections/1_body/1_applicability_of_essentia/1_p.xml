 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. Whilst climate change is a global phenomenon, its effects are felt locally, and hence, effective health adaptation strategies are largely context-specific, with the extent and nature of adaptation required of health systems dependent upon the current health status of a given population. Indeed, this is often one of the most important factors in determining the health impacts of, and responses to, climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>]. Whilst socioeconomic and geographical factors are clearly important as well, much of health adaptation planning has thus-far focused on strengthening existing health system functions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>•]. In delivering this, public health practice may be ideally placed, with its heavy reliance on data and evidence to inform actions; its familiarity with the need to engage multiple sectors and processes within and beyond the formal healthcare system; and its preparedness for responding to unexpected and non-linear events. Indeed, many of the health impacts of climate change represent challenges and threats the health system is already facing in one way or another. To the extent that health adaptation to climate change can be aligned with efforts to strengthen health systems more generally, such interventions represent “no-regrets” options, to be targeted and maximised [
