<p id="Par14" class="p">Few health systems have the financial or organisational capacity to undertake whole-sale adaptation, incorporating all of the interventions described above [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>•]. Indeed, health systems in low- and middle-income countries are often overwhelmed with the day-to-day delivery of basic health services. These interact with a range of other challenges to present significant barriers to effective health adaptation. Broadly defined in this context, barriers are factors that “make it harder to plan and implement adaptation actions or that restrict options” available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. Defining barriers to adaptation is complex, as many are highly context-specific and dependent upon the sectors, geographies, and time scales involved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. That being said, barriers generally fall within four broad categories: economic, informational, institutional or political, and social [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. Economic barriers are those associated with limited or absent financial resources to invest in the research and interventions required for adaptation. Whilst financial constraints are the most commonly referenced barrier to adaptation, and that which may prevent the initiation of an adaptation intervention, they are clearly not the only important barrier. Adequate resourcing is a necessary, but insufficient condition for effective adaptation. Informational barriers make long-term planning difficult, with climate modelling and interpretation of the corresponding health outcomes, often resource intensive and rarely available in a timely manner or at the spatial resolution required. Institutional and political barriers limit organisations’ and governments’ abilities to understand and respond to system-wide changes, with change management and management under significant uncertainty often particularly challenging. Finally, these issues are often compounded by highly complex social barriers, arising as a result of specific values and cultures both within organisations and affected populations.
