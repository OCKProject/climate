<p id="Par37" class="p">This paper has provided an overview of the ways in which climate change and climate science might best be integrated into existing public health practice, to strengthen and inform health adaptation. Climate change presents a significant challenge for the health sector and public health practice. However, the skills needed to adapt are already deployed in public healthâ€”they just need to be translated to climate change adaptation. Here, a modified version of the BRACE framework has been proposed to help promote more effective adaptation. By incorporating an adaptation pathways approach into the BRACE framework, this could help account for the long-term uncertainties of climate change and overcome some of the barriers to climate change. Mainstreaming climate change into public health practice should also streamline adaptation and help to overcome some of the barriers to adaptation planning and implementation getting underway; the benefits of this is already demonstrated by the increasing deployment of climate services in public health practice. However, there are clear limits to adaptation. Mitigation of climate change is therefore absolutely essential, for adaptation alone will not protect human health against all of the impacts of climate change.</p>
