<p id="Par7" class="p">This paper reviews the recent literature on health adaptation, considering the ways in which public health practice can best make use of climate science to inform robust adaptation. How the essential services of public health relate and can be transferred to climate change adaptation will then be discussed. Barriers to the public health sector adapting to climate change will subsequently be outlined and means of overcoming these barriers discussed through some key frameworks on public health adaptation to climate change and mainstreaming climate change into public health practice. Finally, the technological, financial, and physiological limits to adaptation will be highlighted and the implications they have on an effective response to climate change. It will be argued that combining an ‘adaptation pathways approach’ with the BRACE framework (Building Resilience Against Climate Effects) is important in order to integrate long-term uncertainties into short-term adaptation practices. Secondly, that mainstreaming climate change into existing public health practice is the most effective way for public health practice to adapt to climate change and overcome some barriers to adaptation. Finally, this review will conclude with a brief note on the limits to adaptation—noting the importance of a robust, complementary mitigation strategy in order to prevent the most severe health impacts of climate change.</p>
