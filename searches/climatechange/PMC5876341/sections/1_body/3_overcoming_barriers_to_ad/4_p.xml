<p id="Par20" class="p">Whilst the principles of PDIA and adaptive management may be familiar to public health practice, there is still some challenge in applying them to a novel issue such as health adaptation to climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>•]. Indeed, for most public health practitioners, translating climate science into public health practice requires additional capacity and planning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>]. Knowledge of climate change is incomplete in public health practice, and there is generally inadequate staffing and training to improve this understanding, leaving public health systems feeling unprepared and unable to cope. Thus, frameworks specifically outlining how public health systems should adapt to climate change are invaluable. Here, the five steps of the BRACE Framework (“building resilience against climate effects”)—developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)—provide a widely cited and implemented example of an iterative approach:
