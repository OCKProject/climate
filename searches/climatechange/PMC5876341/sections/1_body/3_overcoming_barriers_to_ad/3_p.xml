<p id="Par19" class="p">PDIA and concepts of adaptive management—focusing on continued learning, extensive stakeholder input, and a Bayesian approach to evidence and decision-making—are concepts familiar to much of public health practice [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>]. For adaptive management to be effective, it must regularly assess management objectives; fully understand the needs of the system adaptation is occurring within; implement a range of management decisions; monitor and evaluate their outcomes; be willing to adapt its approach based on this evaluation, incorporating learning into future actions; and offer a collaborative structure for stakeholder participation and learning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. Undertaking such an approach in the context of climate change requires specific tools, notably vulnerability assessments (to identify the most at-risk populations), climate modelling (to project health impacts), and decision-support mechanisms (to avoid maladaptation).
