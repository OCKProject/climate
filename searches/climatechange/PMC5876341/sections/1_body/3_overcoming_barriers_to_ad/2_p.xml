<p id="Par18" class="p">Here, a flexible approach to adaptation management is needed, with more iterative models that not only account for unforeseen problems, but embrace them. Implementing iterative models and reforming practices can be difficult. This is seen regularly in rapidly emerging economies, where multiple sectors are changing simultaneously. Often, capacity constraints result in institutions simply altering their structure and appearance rather than their actions and functions, resulting in “capability traps” which cause systems to stagnate or deteriorate. To avoid these traps, Andrews et al. propose a Problem-Driven Iterative Adaptation (PDIA) approach to complex social interventions. PDIA is built upon four principles: it focuses on solving locally selected and defined problems; it encourages deviation and experimentation from authorised decision-making; it embeds this experimentation into feedback loops to facilitate quick learning; and it deliberately engages a wide range of stakeholders to promote viable, legitimate, relevant, and supportable reforms [
