<p id="Par28" class="p">Complementing the BRACE framework, an ‘adaptation pathways approach’ has been designed to explicitly function over longer timescales and scenarios, incorporating the long-term evolution of climate change into short-term adaptation decisions, and so promoting robust decision-making under uncertainty (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. An adaptation pathways approach establishes a strategic vision for the future and plans for a wide variety of possible climatic and social scenarios over an extended time horizon, establishing adaptation responses to each of these combinations at successive moments in the future. During this process, decision points are identified, at which point choices are made regarding the required adaptation under a certain climate outcome.
