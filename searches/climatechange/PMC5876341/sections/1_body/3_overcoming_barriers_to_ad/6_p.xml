<p id="Par27" class="p">Step one of the BRACE framework is aimed at improving understanding of future climate change, probable health effects, and populations and systems which are most vulnerable; this is obtained through climate data and vulnerability assessments to understand exposures and sensitivities. The second step models the burden of a range of climate-sensitive diseases and is designed to be updated regularly with new information fed into adaptive management processes. Step three requires assessing and identifying the most appropriate adaptation options, both in terms of identifying adaptation responses to specific health risks, and by developing strategies to improve baseline community resilience. The fourth step incorporates the first three steps of the framework to develop a comprehensive health and adaptation plan; this should complement any existing climate change plans and incorporate best practices. The final stage encompasses the iterative element of the framework, evaluating interventions and identifying barriers to effective adaptation, feeding back into the relevant stage [

The BRACE framework provides a powerful means of supporting health system adaptation to climate change and is already being trialled in 16 states and two cities in the USA. For instance, MN has developed an Extreme Heat Toolkit; San Francisco is developing indicators to assess community resilience to climate change; ME is implementing improved monitoring of vector-borne diseases; and MI has increased state and local level capacity to undertake health impact assessments that incorporate climate change [
