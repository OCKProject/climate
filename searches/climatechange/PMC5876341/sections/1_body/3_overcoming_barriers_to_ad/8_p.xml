<p id="Par29" class="p">For example, the Environment Agency in England has adopted an adaptation pathways approach in planning the defence of London and the Thames Estuary against sea level rise. Future climate change scenarios and population projections were modelled, and the extent of sea level rise and populations exposed associated with each scenario were estimated. Adaptation plans and interventions were then developed for the full range of future climatic and social scenarios, with various decision trigger-points identified (for example, adaptation action to be taken with 0.5Â m of sea level rise with a more exposed population), ensuring that the right decisions were made at the right time and financial resource was invested most effectively [

Ultimately, an adaptation pathways approach provides a route map reaching a common, ideal end point (in this case, in-tact flood defences for London). An adaptation pathways approach also helps to avoid maladaptive choices, as it demands regular evaluation and establishes strategic decision points designed to trigger the implementation of the most effective adaptation action given a specific scenario. However, it also gives a suite of options leading to this end point (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This enables flexibility in short-term decisions, allowing appropriate adaptation actions to be adopted according to how climate change evolves over time. Hence, robust, flexible and no-regret adaptation actions are promoted from the start [
