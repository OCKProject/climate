<p id="Par35" class="p">There is an important distinction between barriers to adaptation and limits to adaptation. In general, barriers are possible to overcome, whereas limits are absolute and unsurmountable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>]. Having discussed the barriers to public health adaptation to climate change, it is important to briefly acknowledge the limits to adaptation. Largely, projections of the health burden of climate change are based on assumptions of a global average 2 °C temperature rise; yet it is increasingly unlikely that this target will be achieved [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>•]. Therefore, understanding the technological, financial, and physiological limits of health adaptation are important in revealing the degree of climate change mitigation required. For example, these may take the form of technological limits to the size and strength of future sea walls and flood defences; or to the financial limits associated with the cost of providing safe drinking water in water-stressed regions of the world. A range of limits to human physiology exist as well. Core body temperatures reach fatal levels under sustained periods of wet-bulb temperatures over 35 °C [

By 2071, there is estimated to be 151,500 heat-related deaths in Europe every year, representing a 5400% increase from the average of 2700 annual deaths between 1981 and 2010, and equating to 99% of total future weather-related deaths in Europe [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Furthermore, already 30% of the world’s population is annually exposed to heat events that could result in deaths among vulnerable populations; this is expected to increase to 48% under a low emissions scenario, and 74% under a high emissions scenario [
