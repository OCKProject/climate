 <result pre="Adaptation is &quot;the process of adjustment to actual or expected" exact="climate" post="and its effects&quot;. In human systems, adaptation is intended"/>
 <result pre="to reduce or avoid risks [ 7]. Health adaptation to" exact="climate" post="change can be categorised into three forms. Incidental adaptation"/>
