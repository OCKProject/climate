 <sub class="sub">2</sub> assimilation rate (An) as a function of the intercellular CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (Ci) curve (An‐Ci curve) and the A response to light intensity curve were measured from the leaves of 80 and 87 days old transplanted plants, respectively, using a portable photosynthesis system (Li 6400, LI‐COR Co., Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). The relative humidity in the leaf chamber ranged from 60% to 80%, and the block temperature was maintained at 25°C. The gas exchange responses to CO
