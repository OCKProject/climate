<p class="p">The plant height, leaf length and width, number of leaves, leaf area, and dry matter of hot peppers were estimated at 171 DAT. The three replicates of hot pepper plants were randomly selected in each treatment of the treatments. Plant height (cm/plant) was taken from the surface of soil to the top of the plant. The leaf area was measured using a leaf area meter (LI‐3100, LI‐COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). In addition, the evaluation of chlorophyll content was assessed using a portable chlorophyll meter (SPAD 502, Minolta Camera Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan). In addition, five fruits were sampled for physical traits in terms of length, width, fresh and dry weight records at 171 DAT.</p>
