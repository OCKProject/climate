<p class="p">For evaluation of fruit production, the hot pepper fruits from nine replicate plants were collected during 84 DAT to 171 DAT. In addition, fruits were also harvested at the fully ripened stage. The ripened fruits were classified as normal and abnormal fruits based on calcium deficiency symptoms. The number of days required to harvest after flowering was measured in ten fruits from nine hot pepper plants at three different time periods (labeled flowering data at 47, 57, and 73 DAT, respectively).</p>
