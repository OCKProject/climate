<p class="p">CC scenarios were adapted from the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes’ 4th Assessment Report (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The climate values were adjusted by the RCP scenario parameters and programed into the EWGCs using an advanced environmental control program (SIMATIC WinCC Runtime Advanced V13 SP1, Siemens, Munich, Germany) in terms of air temperature, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, and precipitation. The air temperatures for the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 treatments were set at 3.4 and 6.0°C higher than the weather conditions based on the meteorological data from Jeonju region (three‐year mean; April to October 2013–2015) respectively, while their respective CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations were maintained at 540 and 940 μmol/mol. In addition, precipitation of RCP 4.5 and 8.5 treatments was set at 17.3 and 20.4%, respectively more than that of the control. The control hot pepper treatment was transplanted and grown under the existing weather conditions in Jeonju, Korea. The mean air temperature of the control was 22.8°C during the experimental period, while that for the CC RCP 4.5 and 8.5 treatments was 25.2 and 28.1°C, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). The CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration of the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 treatments represented 520 and 915 μmol/mol, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). The mean relative humidity and daily integral light of all the tested treatments during experimental period were approx. 68% and 35 mol m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> day
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively (Figure
