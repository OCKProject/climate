<p class="p">Leaf samples of the hot pepper were collected 170 DAT. The leaf samples were first fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde for 90 min at 4°C and then washed four to five times at 15‐min intervals in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer solution. The samples were subsequently fixed with 1% osmium tetroxide for 90 min, washed and then they immersed overnight. The samples were dehydrated through a series of graded ethanol concentrations (40, 60, 80, 90, and 95%) for 5 min and then with 100% ethanol for 5, 15, 15, and 30 min before being embedded in Epon (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA, USA) for 4 days at 60°C. The Epon blocks were cut into 1,500 nm sections with an ultramicrotome (Ultracut R, Leica Microsystems, North Ryde, Australia) and stained using periodic acid and Schiff's reagent, before being observed under a microscope (Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) at 100 × magnification.</p>
