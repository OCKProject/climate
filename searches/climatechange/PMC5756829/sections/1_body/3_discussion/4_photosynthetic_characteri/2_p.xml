<p class="p">The net photosynthetic rate of hot pepper leaves declined in air temperatures &gt;35°C. This may be partially attributable to higher rates of respiration at increased temperatures. The FvCB model is a predictor in the assessment of plant responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which was used to simulate photosynthesis under changing environments. The FvCB model has been used in a wide range of physiological studies on crop plants, from estimating the underlying C3 leaf biochemistry to predicting the photosynthetic fluxes of ecosystems in response to climate change (Yin &amp; Struik, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Previous long‐term studies on Kimchi cabbage exposed to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> showed a greater influence on photosynthesis (Choi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), decreasing the net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, and internal CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. Choi et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) suggested that this might occur because decreases in photosynthesis at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations are associated with a decreased demand for carbohydrates. The information from hot pepper using the An‐Ci curve might help to better understand these physiological responses in conditions where CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, light intensity, and air temperature can accurately be controlled. Therefore, results of photosynthesis indicated that RCP 8.5 CC conditions severely negatively impacts on net photosynthetic rate and photosynthesis efficiency of currently common cultivars of hot pepper.
