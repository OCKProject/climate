<p class="p">The CC factors of elevated air temperature and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations affected both growth and fruit development of hot peppers. For optimal growth, experts recommend that night air temperature should be not more than 30°C in hot pepper (Dorland &amp; Went, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1947</xref>). However, daily air temperature in the RCP 8.5 treatment during the experiment period was approximately 30°C (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a), thus, leaf morphogenesis was abnormal, with the rate of leaf enlargement and appearance affected. In addition, N uptake was reduced and the degradation rate of chlorophyll was enhanced by the CC treatments. For example, the RCP 8.5 treatment leaves were slightly yellow in appearance (59.6 SPAD; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33647-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Previous results have suggested that chlorophyll in Kimchi cabbage leaves is also reduced by CC exposure (Lee et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The hot pepper plant normally grows with a single stem, until 9–11 leaves have been formed. The main stem terminates with a flower and then normally two branches grow from the axils of the highest leaves. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a shows that two branches were induced in the control hot pepper plants. However, in the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 treatments, three or more branches were induced. This suggests that vegetative growth may be stimulated when exposed to such CC scenarios. Also, pollination and fertilization of hot pepper are significantly decreased at &gt;30°C air temperature conditions (Erickson &amp; Markhart, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Khah &amp; Passam, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>; Pagamas &amp; Nawata, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Also, at &lt;35°C night air temperature condition, the pollen viability and pollen tube behavior are reduced (Gajanayake, Trader, Reddy, &amp; Harkess, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Usman, Mamat, Mohd, Aishah, &amp; Annuar, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Thus, the control and RCP 4.5 treatments had normal shaped hot pepper fruits, while the RCP 8.5 treatment showed abnormal development (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). The relative humidity was not varied among treatments; the control, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 were similar (68%) during experiment treatment. Therefore, precipitation was not more effects on growth and physical fruit characteristics of hot pepper than air temperature and CO
