<p class="p">The plant height, leaf length, number of leaves, chlorophyll content, and percentage of dry matter of hot pepper were significantly affected by CC scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33647-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The mean plant height in the RCP 4.5 treatment was 203 cm/plant, which was the highest of all the treatments. However, there were no significant differences between the control and the RCP 8.5 treatments. Under the extreme weather conditions (RCP 8.5), leaf length was decreased by 40.7% compared with the control, while number of leaves and percentage dry matter increased approx. 2.2 and 1.3 times, respectively. The chlorophyll content of leaves of the RCP 8.5 treatment was 59.6 SPAD value, which was the lowest among all the tested treatment. There was a significant difference for all the physical traits of hot pepper fruits between treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33647-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). The length and width of fruits of the RCP 8.5 treatment were significantly reduced by 22.3% and 62.5%, respectively. The width of fruits was more affected by CC exposure when compared with the effect on length of the fruit. In addition, fresh and dry fruit weights of the RCP 8.5 were the lowest at 4.1 and 0.8 g/fruit of all the treatments.
