The assessment of photosynthetic efficiency using the An‐Ci curves was conducted using the Farquhar‐von Caemmerer‐Berry's biochemical model (FvCB model). The results indicated that the maximum carboxylation rate, maximum rate of electron transport, triose phosphate utilization rate, and mitochondrial respiration in light of leaves treated with RCP 8.5 were 37.9, 41.4, 5.2, and 1.6 μmol m
