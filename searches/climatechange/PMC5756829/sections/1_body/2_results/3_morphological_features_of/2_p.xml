<p class="p">Cross‐sections of hot pepper leaves indicated that the high temperature/elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration (RCP 8.5) CC scenario induced structural modifications (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33647-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a–c). Hot pepper leaf thickness was similar in all the tested treatments. However, the density of epidermal cells was higher than in control leaves. Intercellular air spaces were significantly reduced by both CC treatments and the number of both palisade and spongy mesophyll parenchyma cells were more apparent in these CC treatments. In addition, in the moderate RCP 4.5 CC treatment leaves, there was a more marked tendency for the development of two layers of palisade parenchyma. In the more extreme CC scenario (RCP 8.5) leaves, more starch grains and a stronger coloration compared to the control treatment.
