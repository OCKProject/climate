<p class="p">The total number of fruits in the control, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 treatments from nine replicate plants was 210, 249, and 59/plant in the harvest period from 84 to 171 DAT. This shows that in the RCP 8.5 treatment, the fruit number was significantly reduced (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33647-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). The mean fresh weight of control showed 6.30 g/fruit, which was greatest among all the tested treatments. The yield in the RCP 8.5 treatment decreased by 89.2% compared with the control. In addition, the production of abnormal fruits in terms of calcium deficiency symptoms occurred more often in the moderate CC scenario (RCP 4.5). The number of days to harvesting of the control was approximately 49 days, while that for the RCP 8.5 treatment was 37 days (Figure
