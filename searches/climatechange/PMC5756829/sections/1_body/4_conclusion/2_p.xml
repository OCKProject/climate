<p class="p">This study found that the severe RCP CC scenarios reduced growth and yields of hot pepper. There were also negative effects on morphogenesis, photosynthesis, and fruit characteristics. However, in the moderate CC RCP 4.5 scenario, growth of hot pepper was more resilient with minimum effects on growth and yield. This suggests that the future breeding programs should focus on practical resilience of hot pepper cultivars to be able to cope with extreme CC scenarios. This will be important to ensure that a supply of this key ingredient for Kimchi in South Korea is not affected by predicted CC events.</p>
