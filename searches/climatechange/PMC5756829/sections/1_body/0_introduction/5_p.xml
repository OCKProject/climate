<p class="p">While several studies have examined the effect of single environmental factors on growth and yield of hot pepper, very few, if any, have examined the impact of interacting CC factors. The objective of this study was to compare the effect of existing growth conditions with moderate and extreme CC scenarios (RCP 4.5; 8.5) on (1) growth and development, (2) morphological characteristics, (3) photosynthesis, and (4) yield of hot pepper.</p>
