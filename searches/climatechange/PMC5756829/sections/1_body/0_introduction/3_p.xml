<p class="p">Climate Change (CC) models predict that the air temperature will rise by between 1 and 4°C by the end of the 21st century, because of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (IPCC, 
 <xref rid="ece33647-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). The temperature of the earth increased by an average of 0.7°C during the past century, and the rate of temperature increase rate is increasing twice as rapidly in Korea since 1980 (IPCC,

For this reason, the Korean Government has initiated research on mitigation and adaptation of key agricultural and horticultural crops to CC scenarios and to examine impacts of moderate and extreme CC scenarios by examining Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of 4.5 and 8.5 (NIMR,
