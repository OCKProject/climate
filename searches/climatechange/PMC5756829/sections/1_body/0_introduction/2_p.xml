<p class="p">Hot pepper (
 <italic class="italic">Capsicum annuum</italic> L.) is a key ingredient of Kimchi, considered to be an important health‐promoting food, both in South Korea and world‐wide. In South Korea, the cultivated area and production per year of hot pepper in 2015 were 34,514 ha and 97,000 tons, respectively. This was economically worth approx. 7.8 billion USD representing 2% of the country's total agricultural products (MAF Statistics,

The crop is thus exposed to the prevailing weather conditions in terms of temperature, radiation, and precipitation. It is thus vulnerable to extreme weather events. Previous studies have suggested that under high precipitation conditions, hot pepper is susceptible to outbreaks of anthracnose or phytophthora diseases which can significantly impact on yield (Hwang &amp; Tae,

Abnormal/extreme weather conditions in terms of extremely high temperature, heavy rainfall, and drought in summer due to climate change are known to be the main causes of a reduction in hot pepper production (Hwang, Kwon, Doh, &amp; Park,
