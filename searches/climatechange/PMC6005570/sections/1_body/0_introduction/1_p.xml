<p class="p">Engaging the public about climate change has proven to be a substantial ongoing challenge for scientists and policy makers. An important first step to effective engagement involves understanding the number and nature of the audiences one needs to targetâ€“a process known as audience segmentation. Segmentation involves specifying a population of interest and identifying homogenous subgroups that share similar demographic and/or psychographic profiles. Once a population has been segmented, climate change communicators can target their messages based on the distinctive characteristics of each subgroup. For example, to stimulate engagement and behaviour change, messages targeting audiences that are sceptical about climate change may require different content, frames, and delivery channels than messages aimed at audiences who are already alarmed about climate change and its impacts [
