   <italic class="italic">Who should be targeted</italic>? Audience segmentation research reveals the number of distinct audiences present in a population, the characteristics of each audience, and their relative sizes. This information is essential for making strategic resource allocation decisions. For example, to optimise resource allocation and cost-effectiveness, an organisation may decide to bypass small, entrenched sceptical segments, and focus on larger uncertain or unconvinced segments who may be easier to engage [

   <italic class="italic">How to optimise messages and intervention programs for each audience selected for targeting</italic>? Audience segments each embody a unique combination of demographic, psychological and behavioural attributes, which can be informative in crafting communications and other interventions designed to address the knowledge needs and behaviour-change barriers facing each segment. For example, some segments may be sceptical about the climate change science, whereas others may be motivated to act, but lack specific information about what they can do.

   <italic class="italic">How to ensure the messages and interventions reach selected audiences</italic>? Audience segments sometimes have unique preferences about where they obtain information about climate change. Some rely heavily on Facebook, others watch cable news, and others prefer reading traditional print media. If climate change communicators use the wrong channels, key messages may fail to reach their intended recipients, and may elicit backlash effects if, for example, a climate message framed for an alarmed audience is presented to a highly sceptical or dismissive one.

   <italic class="italic">How to select messengers for each audience segment</italic>? Not all climate change messengers will be perceived as equally credible and trustworthy by all audience segments. Divisive figures like former Australian Prime Ministers Tony Abbott and Julia Gillard are highly respected by some, and reviled by others. Audience segmentation can aid climate change communicators in selecting messengers with the relevant expertise, values and personal experiences needed to build and maintain trust with their particular audiences.
