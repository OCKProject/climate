<p class="p">Using the DEFRA segmentation framework, Horton and Doran [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>] found that shifts between segments could be facilitated by targeting individuals’ beliefs about fairness related to sustainable consumption and climate change. Following focus group sessions, numbers of individuals classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Positive Greens</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Waste Watchers</italic> increased and respondents classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Stalled Starters</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> decreased. Flora et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] found that exposing high school students to an engaging 50-minute entertainment-education presentation on climate science increased their knowledge of climate science, positive engagement with climate change, and almost all assessed conservation behaviours. Maibach et al.’s [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] segmentation tool was used to group students into the Six Americas audience segments approximately 2.5 days before and after the edutainment. Thirty-eight percent of students moved into a more engaged segment after the edutainment, whereas only 13% moved to a less engaged segment. The largest shifts into more engaged segments were from the initially 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> groups.
