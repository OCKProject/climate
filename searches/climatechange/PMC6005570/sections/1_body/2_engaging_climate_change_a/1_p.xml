<p class="p">Although most climate change segmentation studies have focused on identifying segments and how they change over time, researchers are becoming increasingly interested in determining how to best engage with the audience segments they identify. Morrison et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] examined how to engage household segments in climate change policy. They found the perceived trustworthiness of celebrities, scientists and left-wing politicians decreased steadily across the segments from 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>. They argued that the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> segment was the most politically-salient voter segment because its members were relatively open to changing their climate change views and were generally supportive of both government and opposition policies.
