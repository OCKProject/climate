<p class="p">In another Australian study focusing on how message content influences climate change adaptation intentions, Hine et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] found messages with strong negative emotive content or that provided specific adaptation advice increased adaptation intentions in all three of their viewer segments (
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Uncertain</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic>). The study also found that including information about local impacts and not mentioning climate change was effective in increasing engagement in 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> audiences. Similarly, in another Australian study, Bain et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>] demonstrated that pro-environmental messages framed in terms of social welfare and economic development, as opposed to avoiding risks associated with climate change, were more likely to be accepted by
