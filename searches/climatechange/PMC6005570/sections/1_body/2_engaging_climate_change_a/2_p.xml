<p class="p">Morrison’s research group [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] further investigated cautious respondents by identifying cautious sub-segments (
 <italic class="italic">Stay-at-home Parents</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Professionals</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Retirees</italic>), and evaluating each sub-segment’s responsiveness to marketing stimuli. Overall, the word “farmer” and images of farmers evoked positive emotions and a desire to act, and only one call to action—“
 <italic class="italic">Deteriorating atmosphere is a major issue in the world today</italic>”—was received positively by all cautious respondents.
