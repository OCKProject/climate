<p class="p">This emerging evidence of issue fatigue suggests that efforts are needed to keep households going in their efforts to reduce climate emissions and adapt to climate change. Messages could seek to reinforce personal efficacy, and to provide positive reasons such as health, social welfare, economic and other community benefits for maintaining efforts to reduce carbon emissions [

 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] which were designed to inoculate sub-populations of concern against misinformation campaigns used both affective and cognitive messaging. These experiments sought to inform participants about the degree of scientific consensus and the nature of misinformation campaigns, and were found to be effective at neutralising the harmful effects of misinformation. Public scorecards could also be used to remind households (and businesses) about progress with respect to energy use and use of public transport, similar to currently-used reminders about domestic water usage and reservoir water levels. Both members of 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments indicate a willingness to change their minds about climate change, so despite their views that they do not need to change their current level of effort, information campaigns about what they should be doing and why are increasingly likely to resonate given their growing experience of and belief in climate change.
