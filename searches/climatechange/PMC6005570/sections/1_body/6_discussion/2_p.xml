<p class="p">Our results indicate that most Australian households now consider that climate change is occurring, and that almost two-thirds consider that it is mostly caused by humans. Further, compared to 2011, in our most recent 2016 survey, households overall are more likely to believe that they have experienced the effects of climate change and they think the effects are more imminent. They are also more likely to believe that climate change is human induced and that there is consensus between scientists. However, the former view is only held by at least 50% of households in 3 out of 6 segments, while the latter view is only held by at least 50% of households in 2 out of 6 segments. The increasing belief in human induced climate change is consistent with Leviston et al. [
