 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments (down from 27.8% to 19.6%) of households and an increase in the proportion of respondents who are in the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments (up from 26.8% to 32.7%), though the proportion of households in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments is relatively stable. Together these findings are suggestive that community awareness of climate change and acceptance of the basic facts are both increasing.
