<p class="p">Although more Australians report experiencing effects of climate change and are expressing greater concern about the issue, issue fatigue appears to be increasing, particularly among households not in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments. This can be seen in the reduced issue involvement of multiple segments, with reductions in how much they had thought about climate change before today and how often they discuss the issue with family and friends. It is also seen in a decline in household willingness to address climate change. Apart from increased use of public transport, household efforts to mitigate emissions are static or declining, and households overall do not believe that they should be doing more. This applies especially to the members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments. Similarly, there is a decreasing will to reward or punish companies for their climate change behaviours. Regarding what the government should do, households are on average converging on the view that Australia should make a “medium scale effort even if it has moderate economic consequences”. Thus, overall, households increasingly believe in climate change, are experiencing it and are more worried about it, but they do not think that they or businesses should do much more than they already are about it, and that Australia should only make a moderate effort to deal with it. The country appears to be at risk of entering into a state of resigned acceptance.
