 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> end (though not in changes over time in the average scores in each segment). However, there is also evidence of decreased issue involvement. This implies a need to move beyond using strategies to increase awareness and acceptance of climate change, to developing and using strategies to keep people focused on efforts to address climate change.
