<p class="p">Segmentation of a sample of the Indian population, using a subset of the Yale/George Mason group’s measures, identified six segments: 
 <italic class="italic">Informed</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Experienced</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Undecided</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Unconcerned</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Indifferent</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic>. Notably, the proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> respondents in India was considerably larger in rural settings (19%) than in urban settings (10%) [

 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>] factor-analysed responses to a set of questions that consisted primarily of the Yale/George Mason Group’s measures. Cluster analysis of the resulting seven factor scores identified five segments that were collectively labeled the 
 <italic class="italic">Five Germanys</italic>: 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned Activists</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic>. This finding revealed a relatively high degree of concern about climate change among German respondents. Of particular interest was the finding that the highly dismissive segment present in the US, Australian and Indian samples was absent in Germany.
