<p class="p">In both 2011 and 2016 the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> end tended to be older, male, live in less urbanised areas and are more likely to be self-employed. When classified by political party preference, the Greens and Labor (both progressive parties) have a higher proportion of 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic>, while those expressing a preference for Liberal or National (both conservative parties) are more likely to be 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>, consistent with findings in the US [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] and Australia [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Nevertheless there has been a distinct movement so that a higher proportion of the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> were Liberal voters in 2016 than in 2011 and a lower proportion of the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> were Liberal voters. These two sets of changes over time are statistically significant. This result points to a convergence of views on climate change issues of supporters of the major political parties.
