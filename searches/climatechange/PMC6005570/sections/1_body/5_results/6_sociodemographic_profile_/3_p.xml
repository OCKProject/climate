<p class="p">The characteristics of the middle segments,

 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. The changes in the characteristics of the 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segment from 2011 to 2016 were substantial. While they tended to be slightly older than the overall sample mean in 2011, they became the youngest segment in 2016. They recorded significant changes in degree qualified (increase), trade qualified (decrease), income (increase from lowest to highest category), rural to urban, being employed full or part-time or casual (increase), and voting intentions towards the National party (increase), though they still remained by far the segment having the highest proportion of people who indicate no interest in politics or would not indicate their voting intentions.
