<p class="p">The six segments identified were labelled 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>. As shown in Tables 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t001" class="xref">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t004" class="xref">4</xref>, they were profiled using 35 items based on climate change beliefs, issue involvement, preferred societal response, and energy use behaviours. The 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> segment followed by the 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segment have higher proportions who are certain that global warming is occurring, who accept human causation and consider that there is scientific consensus about global warming, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and particularly the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments have the low proportions with these views. Members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments are those who could most easily change their mind about climate change. Further details are presented about each of these segments in the following.
