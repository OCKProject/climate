<p class="p">The response to a number of other questions in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref> shows a lower emphasis on behaviours to reduce climate change impacts. All four questions on actions in relation to companies taking steps to (or opposing steps to) reduce their climate change impact show a reduced commitment to take action between 2011 and 2016, though not all changes are statistically significant. The intention to walk or ride a bike instead of driving shows little change from 2011 and 2016. About the only area that shows a minor positive change in energy use behaviour is the intention to take public transport or car pool.
