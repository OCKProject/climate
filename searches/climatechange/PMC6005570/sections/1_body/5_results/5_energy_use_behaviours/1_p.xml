<p class="p">Every question in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t004" class="xref">Table 4</xref> (on energy use behaviours in both 2011 and 2016) follows a declining trend when you move from the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> through to the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> category. Hence, the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> are more likely to reward companies that reduce emissions and punish companies that do not. They are also more interested in carpooling, bicycling and adjusting thermostats. In two areas–thermostat use and intention to reward companies that reduce emissions–there has been a decline between 2011 and 2016 for all groups, with a statistically significant decline for five of the six groups on thermostat use, and for three of the six groups in relation to rewarding companies that reduce emissions. While from an Australian perspective these two seem like US-centric activities, especially related to heating where, for many years, the US media has emphasised regulation of thermostats, the decline since 2011 still indicates an area of concern in Australia. It is possible that this decline is a rebound effect related to the increased use of renewable energy [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]; given that Australians have substantially increased their reliance on rooftop solar panels during the past five years (from about 308,000 households with panels in January 2011 to almost 1.5 million in January 2017) [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], they may be inclined to use more electricity to maintain household comfort. Another possibility is that the result is due to 2011 survey occurring during winter, while the 2016 survey occurred during summer, and this differing context may have affected results.
