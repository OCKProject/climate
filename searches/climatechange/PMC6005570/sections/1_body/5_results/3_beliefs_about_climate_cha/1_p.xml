<p class="p">The results in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> for both 2011 and 2016 on beliefs about climate change in Australia confirm that the categories can be ranked from 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic>. The responses for both years in general have a response profile that is increasing or decreasing across the six segments. For example, the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments have higher proportions certain that climate change is occurring and has human causation, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments have low proportions with these views. The 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> tend to view themselves as being harmed by climate change, and have a more positive view of the efficacy of individual and collective action to combat the problem. To assist in reading the results in
