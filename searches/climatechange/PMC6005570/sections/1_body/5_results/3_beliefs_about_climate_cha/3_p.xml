<p class="p">Turning to changes that have occurred from 2011 to 2016, the results of 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> indicate that, on average, a higher proportion believes that (a) climate change is happening (though only for the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> group has there been a significant change); (b) it is caused by human activities (significant change across all groups except the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> group); and (c) there is consensus among scientists (significant change across all groups except the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> group). Of the ten remaining beliefs shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref> there was a statistically significant change for either only one segment (four cases) or no change (six cases). Also, the category that had the greatest number of statistically significant changes (five) was the 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> group. While all five of these changes were towards engagement with climate change, they were from a low base so that this group still effectively remained detached in 2016.
