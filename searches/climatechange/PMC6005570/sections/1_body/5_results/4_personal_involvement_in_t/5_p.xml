<p class="p">An overall summary of the results is that there is more concern about climate change, particularly as reflected in the movement of households into groups expressing higher concern (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197988.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>), even though there is little change in the mean level of concern within each group (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). In other words, the general trend is for households to increase their level of concern and for some to consequently move to groups portraying more concern on average. However, those who do so move would be expected to enter their new group with scores lower than mean for this group, and thereby suppress any tendency for the group mean to rise. There is also more experiencing of climate change despite the fact that a larger proportion of respondents have thought less about the issue. Also there is a higher reluctance to address climate change.
