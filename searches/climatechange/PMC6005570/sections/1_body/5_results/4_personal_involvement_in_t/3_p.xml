<p class="p">In terms of action, all groups considered that corporations and citizens should be doing less to address climate change in 2016 than in 2011, though only for the 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> group were these changes statistically significant. Indeed, this group has the highest number of significant changes for the issues covered in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. These changes show that the 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> group are more worried in 2016 about climate change and are more likely to have personally experienced the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, the other statistically significant changes show that a smaller proportion of this group in 2016 also considers that corporations and citizens should do more to address climate change, and a similar smaller proportion considers that Australia should reduce its emissions regardless of what others do. The 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> group also has a statistically significant reduction between 2011 and 2016 in how much they have thought about climate change issues.
