<p class="p">The decline in belief that corporations or industry or citizens should be doing more about climate change, or that Australia should unilaterally reduce its emissions, among members of the 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segment most likely also reflects changes in the membership of the segment rather than just changes in the views of those who were 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> members in 2011. Results presented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197988.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> indicated that membership of the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> segments increased while membership of the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments declined. Thus some respondents that were in 2011 would have been classified as 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> have shifted in 2016 to become either 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic>. It is probable that this is because they have now begun to experience the effects of climate change. However, these respondents may still have the attitude generally held by those in the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments that individuals and business are not responsible to act to reduce climate change and that the government should not act unilaterally. If so, this would reduce the means for these variables and lead to this result. The other possible explanation is that others in this segment have changed their view over time regarding who should be responsible and the actions that Australia should take; however, we regard the former as the more plausible explanation.
