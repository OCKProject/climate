<p class="p">There are five questions in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref> about personal involvement in climate change issues that do not follow the monotonically increasing or decreasing pattern generally observed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0197988.t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The first three of these show that those who desire more information, have friends who share their views and are unwilling to change their opinions are at either end of the spectrum in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> categories. This confirms the observation made in Morrison et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] that those in the categories 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> are more open to change and hence to being influenced by a targeted marketing message. The other two questions that do not portray monotonic change are on how much respondents have thought about climate change and how often they discuss the issue with family and friends. There is no obvious pattern across the categories for these two questions.
