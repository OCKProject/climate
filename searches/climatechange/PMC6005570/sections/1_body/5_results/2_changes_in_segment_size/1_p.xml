 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0197988.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> shows the proportion of respondents falling into the six different segments in 2011 and 2016. The key result is that there has been a leftward movement during the period towards the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> categories and away from the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> groups. With a Chi-square value of 48.83, the difference is statistically significant. While there is an increased proportion in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> group (from 15.0% to 17.5%), the major shifts are out of the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> groups and into the 
 <italic class="italic">Cautious</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Disengaged</italic> groups. With 32.7% now in these latter two groups (up from 26.8%), there would be a higher likelihood of climate change messages being effective because Morrison et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0197988.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] showed that members of these two groups are likely to have their opinions on climate change issues easily changed.
