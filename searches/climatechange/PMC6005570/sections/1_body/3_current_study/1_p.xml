<p class="p">The current study extends the Australian climate change audience segmentation literature by exploring how segment membership has changed from 2011 to 2016 in comparable Australian samples using the Yale/George Mason group’s Six America’s classification system. Longitudinal segmentation enabled us to quantitatively assess the extent to which climate change perceptions, policy preferences and behaviour have shifted during the past five years, and also the uniformity of these shifts across various demographic and political subgroups (e.g., urban versus rural, Coalition versus Labor voters, etc.). This will provide practical, actionable information to help climate change communicators to more effectively craft and target their messages.
