<p class="p">We surveyed 1,927 Australian respondents in August 2011 and 2,503 respondents in January and February 2016 selected from an online panel provided by the Online Research Unit. The Charles Sturt University Faculty of Business Ethics in Human Research Committee provided ethics approval for the survey work which involved an online questionnaire (protocol number 200/2015/20). Consent to participate was informed. The purpose of the survey was explained to respondents prior to starting the survey, and other details related to consent including that the survey was voluntary, and that they were free to not participate or to stop participating once they had started the survey. Respondents were told that they could stop participating at any time by closing their browser window. In addition, a statement at the end of the section providing information about the survey was included stating “If you wish to participate, click here”.</p>
