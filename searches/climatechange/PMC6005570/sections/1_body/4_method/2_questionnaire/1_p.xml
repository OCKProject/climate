While one goal of the overall research project was the segmentation of households, other sections of the questionnaire were designed to assess the willingness to pay of households for various policies, to examine the issue of improving the effectiveness of communications about climate change, and to compare the climate change beliefs and attitudes of different religious groups. Findings from our 2011 survey on segmentation where we compare Australia and the US are presented in Morrison et al. [
