We follow the conventional approach of this type of survey work and ask respondents to represent their household. Thus while individuals complete the questionnaire, we analyse the results by household. Latent class analysis was run using Latent Gold 4.5 to identify segments [

We tested a range of segment solutions, and higher numbers of segments were generally better, based on a range of measures including AIC, BIC and log-likelihood. However, given the impracticality for policy makers of using a larger number of segments, the desire to compare the results of this study with our earlier findings, and because larger segmentation solutions generally do not produce substantively different segments to those found in smaller solutions, it was decided to use a six-segment solution. Note that this decision to use six rather than a larger number of segments parallels a similar decision made by Maibach et al. [
