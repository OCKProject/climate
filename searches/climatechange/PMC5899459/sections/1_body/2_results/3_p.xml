<p class="p">Between 2010 and 2299, the model simulations of soil C for the RCP4.5 projection varied from gains of 70 Pg C to losses of 67 Pg C (mean 3-Pg C gain ± 50-Pg C SD;

 </xref>). For the RCP8.5 projection, all of the models projected large net losses of soil C by 2299 that ranged from 74 to 652 Pg C (mean 341-Pg C loss ± 242-Pg C SD;

 </xref>). Although all of the models projected net losses of soil C by 2299 for the RCP8.5 projection, the trajectories of soil C dynamics differed substantially among the models, with some models indicating that net soil C losses will occur throughout the projection period and others indicating that there would be a period of net soil C gain before losses ensued. The models also differed in the relative amount of soil C that would be lost by 2299 with three models losing less than 20% vs. two models that lost 50% and 63% of their initial soil C stock in 2010. Among the three models that ran sensitivity simulations, temperature changes were ∼16 times more important than precipitation changes in causing losses of net soil C for the RCP8.5 scenario.
