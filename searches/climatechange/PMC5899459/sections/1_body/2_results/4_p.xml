<p class="p">Between 2010 and 2299, four of the five models indicated gains in vegetation C of up to 175 (mean, 69 ± 70 SD) Pg C for the RCP4.5 projection (

 </xref>). In the simulations for the RCP4.5 projection, the gains in vegetation C were largely responsible for the overall projected net gains in ecosystem C by 2299 (8- to 244-Pg C gains; mean, 71 ± 99 SD Pg C;

 </xref>). In contrast, for the RCP8.5 projection, gains in vegetation C were not great enough to compensate for the losses of C projected by four of the five models, so that net changes in ecosystem C ranged from a loss of 641 Pg C to a gain of 167 Pg C by 2299 (mean loss, 208 Pg C ± 307 SD Pg C;

 </xref>). Although the models disagreed as to whether net losses of ecosystem C would begin before or after 2100, all of the models indicated that substantial net losses of ecosystem C would not occur until after 2100 as a result of vegetation gain offsetting any soil C losses (
