The models generally agreed on the areal extent of near-surface permafrost loss except one simulation for the RCP8.5 climate trajectory, which projected only about one-half of the loss by 2299 relative to the other models. Among the models that ran sensitivity simulations, ∼90% of the estimated permafrost loss was explained by model sensitivities to changes in air temperature (warming effect in
