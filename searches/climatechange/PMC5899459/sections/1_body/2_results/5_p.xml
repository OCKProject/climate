<p class="p">To gain a greater understanding of the variation in model responses, we analyzed the sensitivity of net primary production (NPP) and heterotrophic respiration (HR) to changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (given no change in climate), mean annual air temperature (given no other changes in climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and annual precipitation (given no other changes in climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) at the regional scale for three of the models. This analysis indicates that both NPP and HR were quite sensitive to changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase of 800 ppmv, but NPP of the other models is not yet saturated for a CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase of 1,600 ppmv.
