<p class="p">Although the response to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization is the primary reason for increases in C storage simulated by the models, models did exhibit substantial sensitivity of NPP to changes in air temperature. In recent decades, increasing temperatures appear to have increased plant biomass in tundra (
 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>), although some recent studies indicate that the long-term trend of greening in tundra may be experiencing a reversal in this decade (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>). Some analyses suggest that productivity in boreal forest regions has decreased in recent decades (
 <xref rid="r36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>). In contrast, models generally indicate that NPP and vegetation C in the northern permafrost region have increased historically (
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>) and will continue to increase in the future (this study). It is important to recognize that there are some potentially important interactions of the NPP response to both changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature. For example, models that include N dynamics can predict increases in NPP in response to warming because of increased nitrogen availability released as a consequence of increased HR in response to warming (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>), which may work against the N limitation of NPP to enhanced atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. This response of NPP to enhanced N availability from soil warming occurs in TEM6, and is largely the reason why the model does not have as large a loss of soil C that would be expected because of N limitation to enhanced atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. In addition, warming may lengthen the growing season to allow vegetation to take up more CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere. Because the responses of ecosystem C among the models in this study depend substantially on the responses of NPP, which has a complicated response to changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature, it is important to better reconcile the NPP sensitivity of the models to changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and temperature with observation-based analyses of changes in productivity and biomass.
