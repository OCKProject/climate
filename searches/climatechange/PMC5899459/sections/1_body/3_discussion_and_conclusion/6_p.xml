<p class="p">The sensitivities of model NPP responses to changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> for RCP4.5 were between 1.9% and 15.4% increase in NPP per 100-ppmv CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> before saturation, which is generally consistent with syntheses of free-air exchange CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment (FACE) experiments (mean of 13% globally) (
 <xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>). However, it is important to recognize that these syntheses primarily represent FACE experiments that were conducted in temperate forests. Thus, there is the need for FACE experiments in the northern permafrost region to better constrain model responses to enhance atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the region. In this study, the model with the least sensitivity (TEM6) was the only model in the sensitivity analysis for which C uptake was limited by plant N dynamics. Because the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> response of the northern permafrost region is expected to be damped by N limitation (
 <xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>), it is important for earth system models to make progress in implementing N limitation to more effectively constrain analyses of the permafrost carbonâ€“climate feedback.
