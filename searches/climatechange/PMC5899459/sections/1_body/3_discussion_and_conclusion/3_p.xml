<p class="p">This conclusion is tempered by three primary sources of uncertainty, one of which is associated with climate forcing, one of which is associated with model structural and functional deficiencies, and one of which is associated with variability in the sensitivity of the models to climate forcing. We only used the climate projections from one earth system model in the CMIP5 archive to facilitate comparison of sensitivity to forcing among the models. We considered the CCSM4 CMIP5 climate projections both appropriate and representative projections from the CMIP5 archive because of (
