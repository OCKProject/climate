<p class="p">It is important to recognize that biogeochemical models generally applied in the northern permafrost region have known structural and functional deficiencies (

Moss can be an important component of the vegetation in some ecosystems of the northern permafrost region. For example, moss comprises 40% of biomass in sedge tundra ecosystems (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>). Even though the models in this study have some deficiencies with respect to modeling the full dimensions of C dynamics in the northern permafrost region, it is important to recognize that earth system models in general do not include any representation of the permafrost carbon–climate feedback because the land models generally used in earth system models have not yet included vertically resolved C dynamics in the soil. Thus, this study provides an important comparison point for future efforts to evaluate the permafrost carbon–climate feedback by the earth system model community as they become more capable of evaluating the magnitude of the permafrost carbon–climate feedback.
