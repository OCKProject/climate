<p class="p">The vulnerability of permafrost and ecosystem C pools in the permafrost region depends in part on the exposure of permafrost C to changes in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and climate. This study analyzed this vulnerability for climate change projections that represented both substantive and little/no mitigation effort. Our analysis indicates that the northern permafrost region could act as a net sink for C (that includes both changes in both vegetation and soil C) under more aggressive climate change mitigation pathways, which both process-based and atmospheric inversion models suggest has been happening in recent decades (

 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>). Although enhanced NPP could maintain the net sink under aggressive mitigation pathways, it is important to realize that, during this century and beyond, soil C in permafrost will be exposed to decomposition once thawed under any warming pathway, a portion of which will be lost to the atmosphere. Under less aggressive mitigation pathways, the region would likely act as a net source of C to the atmosphere, as noted by previous syntheses (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>), but substantial net losses of C would not occur until after 2100. These results suggest that effective mitigation efforts during the remainder of this century could substantially attenuate the negative consequences of net C releases from the permafrost region.
