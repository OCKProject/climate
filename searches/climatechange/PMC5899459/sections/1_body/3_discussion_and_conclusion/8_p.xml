<p class="p">In general, the models indicate that HR is more sensitive to temperature change than NPP, and that HR is much more sensitive in the RCP8.5 simulations than the RCP4.5 simulations as more soil C becomes exposed to decomposition because of deeper permafrost thaw. This variability in temperature sensitivity, combined with variability in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> sensitivity, leads to substantial uncertainty in the timing and magnitude of the permafrost carbonâ€“climate feedback. Data to constrain the HR responses to warming have recently been synthesized (
