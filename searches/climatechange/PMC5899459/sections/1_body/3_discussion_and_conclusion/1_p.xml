<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">It is important to assess the degree to which the climate system is sensitive to the loss of C in the permafrost region. However, most land models that are being used within earth system models, which are being developed to consider how interactions among physical, biological, and human systems influence climate, do not yet represent the linkage between permafrost and soil C dynamics needed to confidently assess the response of C in the northern permafrost region to projected climate change. Syntheses of models that do represent this linkage estimate that the feedback to the climate system from the decomposition of frozen soil C in permafrost could add up to 0.27 °C additional global warming by 2100 and up to 0.42 °C by 2300 for climate change scenarios that represent little or no mitigation effort (
