<p content-type="flushleft" class="p">A recent data-based synthesis has estimated that the release of soil carbon (C) to the atmosphere by 2100 from the northern permafrost region will be between 12 and 113 Pg C (10
 <sup class="sup">15</sup> g) C for climate change pathways involving both substantive and little or no mitigation effort (

In addition to the data synthesis approach, several process-based models have coupled thaw depth dynamics to the vertical distribution of soil C storage in the northern permafrost region (

A compilation of the responses of these models to climate pathways involving little or no mitigation (e.g., representative concentration pathway RCP8.5) has estimated losses of C from the permafrost region of between 37 and 174 Pg C by 2100 (mean, 92 Pg C) (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>). One difficulty in comparing the results of these models is that they were driven by climate change output from different climate models. Furthermore, since these estimates assumed little or no climate mitigation effort, it remains unclear to what extent climate mitigation policies may be effective in preventing the negative consequences of C release from the northern permafrost region. Finally, because C dynamics of the northern permafrost region may be nonlinear with time (
