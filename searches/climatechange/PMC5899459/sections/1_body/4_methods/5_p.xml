<p class="p">Our analysis of the variability in the sensitivity of C focuses on changes in soil C, vegetation C, and total ecosystem C between 2010 and 2299. Soil C is an aggregated variable that is the sum of estimates for litter C, organic horizon C, mineral soil C, coarse woody debris, land use pools (e.g., wood and agricultural products), and soil C exudates reported by some models. Vegetation C is the sum of any live vegetation pool and typically includes leaves, stems, and root C. Although the models in this study did not consider moss to be an explicit dynamic compartment in the vegetation, they either lumped moss biomass/NPP into a leaf compartment or into the aggregated vegetation biomass/NPP so that it is considered implicitly as part of the vegetation C dynamics. Ecosystem C is the sum of the aggregated soil and vegetation C pools.</p>
