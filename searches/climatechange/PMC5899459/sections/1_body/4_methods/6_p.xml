<p class="p">The fluxes we considered in this study for calculating C balance included NPP, HR, fire emissions (Fire C), biogenic CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions (BIO C-CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>), and lateral C fluxes. NPP is the net uptake of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> by vegetation and represents the difference between photosynthetic uptake and plant respiration. HR is the release of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> to the atmosphere associated with decomposition of dead organic matter. Fire C is the release of C-related compounds to the atmosphere from the combustion of above- and below-ground C pools during fire. We assumed that all of Fire C is CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> since the models did not distinguish among species of C emitted (i.e., CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, CO, and pyrogenic CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>). BIO C-CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> represents biogenic CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions to the atmosphere from the production of methane by methanogenic organisms in the soil minus any uptake in the soil column by methanotrophic organisms. In general, the models in this study do not explicitly consider the CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> emissions from lakes in the permafrost region, although their definition of the spatial extent of wetlands may include lakes. Lateral C includes any lateral losses of C from the ecosystem C pools that we do not directly estimate in the balance with the atmosphere, and include the lateral transfer of harvest products from agriculture, forestry, and land use, as well as C fluxes to aquatic ecosystems such as dissolved organic C. Note that some proportion of lateral C is returned to that atmosphere at the regional scale, but the models in this study do not estimate that proportion.
