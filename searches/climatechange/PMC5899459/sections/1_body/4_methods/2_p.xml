<p class="p">All models were driven with a common projection period forcing by applying monthly climate anomalies/scale factors from a CCSM4 simulation that included the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (2006–2100) (

The historical (before 2010) driving datasets in this study were model dependent as a number of models were involved in activities that relied on the use of different retrospective forcing datasets. Therefore, each modeling group was free to choose appropriate driving datasets for climate, atmospheric CO

 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>). The spin-up process was also specific to each model, but it was conducted to support the delivery of simulation results starting in 1960. Guidance was provided from the Permafrost Carbon Network modeling group on how to apply the monthly anomalies, but each modeling group was responsible for harmonizing the historical and future datasets that were to be used for driving their models. The same time series for global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations was used to drive all models.
