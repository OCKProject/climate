 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the location of glaciers and ice sheets in the Northern Hemisphere, (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) the extent of the boreal Asia, boreal Europe, and boreal North America regions (
 <xref rid="r39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>), and (
 <italic class="italic">iii</italic>) other permafrost areas outside of these areas identified as part of the northern permafrost domain in a permafrost and ground ice condition map (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>). The models in this study did not simulate permafrost and C dynamics for glacier and ice sheet area. The areas of boreal Asia, Europe, and North America facilitate comparisons with inversion model analyses of the C cycle. The “Other” area includes areas of Tibet and various mountain ranges in the Northern Hemisphere as well as areas just south of boreal Asia that are considered part of the permafrost region (
