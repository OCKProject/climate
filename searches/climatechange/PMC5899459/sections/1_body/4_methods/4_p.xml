<p class="p">Our analysis of simulated permafrost dynamics focuses on changes in near-surface permafrost area between 2010 and 2299. While there are many different ways to define and estimate the presence of near-surface permafrost [Wang et al. (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>)], we operationally define the area of near-surface permafrost in this study as the area simulated in which the maximum seasonal active layer thickness (ALT) is less than 3 m, that is, where the bulk of the frozen C is located (
