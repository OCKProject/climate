<p class="p">Compared with other earth system models, the CCSM4 simulations we used for forcing projected intermediate levels of temperature change for both global and northern high latitudes domains for both RCP4.5/ECP4.5 and RCP8.5/ECP8.5 pathways (

CCSM4 was among the higher performing models with respect to the mean present-day temperature bias across the northern permafrost region (
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>). In general, the temperature and precipitation trajectories over the northern permafrost region projected by CCSM4 for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 did not diverge until around 2040. However, divergence was substantial after 2040, with these variables for RCP4.5 more or less stable by 2100, while for RCP8.5 these variables were not stable even by 2299. Between the decades of 2010–2019 and 2290–2299, the CCSM4 simulations for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 pathways, respectively, project that over the northern permafrost region (
