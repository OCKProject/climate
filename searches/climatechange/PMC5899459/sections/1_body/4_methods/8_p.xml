<p class="p">To determine the relative effects of the atmospheric temperature, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, and precipitation drivers on the C cycle responses of the models, we conducted three additional simulations in addition to the simulation with all of the drivers. A subset of the models performed separate simulations with (
