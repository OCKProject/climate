 <p class="p">The study was performed within the EU FP7-funded project SWITCH-ON (grant agreement 603587), which explores the untapped potential of Open Data to tackle changes in the Hydrosphere. Modelling of climate-change impact in Sweden was funded by the Knowledge Center for Climate Change Adaptation at SMHI and we would like to acknowledge contributions from Elin Sjöqvist and Jenny Axén-Mårtensson at SMHI for this part. Modelling of the hydropower influence was funded by the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management (HaV) and we would like to acknowledge valuable data of Dalälven River from Niclas Hjerdt, SMHI. The investigation was performed at the SMHI Hydrological Research unit, where much work benefits from joint efforts in developing models and concepts by the whole team. The scientific findings will contribute to the decadal research initiative “Panta Rhei—changes in hydrology and society” by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS).</p>
