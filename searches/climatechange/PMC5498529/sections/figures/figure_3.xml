  <p class="p">Spatial variability of impact from regulation and climate change on local flow regime. Seasonal flow regimes in 12 regulated Swedish Rivers under present conditions (

   <italic class="italic">green</italic>) or projections from climate models (
   <italic class="italic">blue</italic> and

The map shows the calculated accumulated degree of hydropower regulation in Swedish rivers. The climate impact modelling was based on CMIP5 projections for the RCP 4.5 and 8.5 from: CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, EC-EARTH, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MPI-EMS-LR, NorESM1-M, HadGEM2-ES. Each ensemble member was downscaled using RCA
