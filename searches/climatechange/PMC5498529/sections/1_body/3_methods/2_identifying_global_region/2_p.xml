<p id="Par34" class="p">The second assumption implies that the snowmelt during spring is stored in the hydropower reservoirs to be released at other times of the year. This was guided by hydrological interpretation of similarities in observed flow signatures at continental scale (using 1366 river gauges), showing that all snow-dominated regions had clear influence of hydropower regulation in most hydrographs

 </sup>. Following, we did an empirical study using observations from major reservoirs across Europe, representing a wider range of dam types, operations and climate than in Sweden and giving an indication of a possible global relationship. We compared seasonality in observed outflow at dams outlets with the seasonality of simulated inflows, using a pan-European hydrological model (E-HYPE v2.1)

 </sup>. For each dam, we quantified the month of peak natural inflows and the month of peak regulated outflows. The difference reflects the impact of the dam on natural flow regime.
