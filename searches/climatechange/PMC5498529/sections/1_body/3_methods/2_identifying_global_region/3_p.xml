<p id="Par35" class="p">We then compared the change in peak flow month with a number of factors including mean winter temperature, dam capacity, dam capacity compared to inflows, the dam’s regulation volume compared to inflows, and the fraction of precipitation falling as snow (snow fraction). The only significant relationship was found between change in peak flow month and snow fraction and (R2 = 0.19, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.001). We found no significant relationship for any of the other variables. Snow fraction was thus found to be an indicator of hydropower regulation with seasonal redistribution of flow.
