 </sup>. This data set collates data on reservoirs with a capacity &gt;0.1 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>, which includes more than 6000 reservoirs worldwide with a combined capacity of 6200 km
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>. To determine the large-scale degree of regulation we used the global composite runoff field in GranD (called GCRF), which combines observed discharge with climate-driven runoff estimates to get a composite runoff field consistent with observations. The local degree of regulation at each dam (
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">reg</sub>) was calculated by dividing the dam capacity with the mean annual inflows to the dam 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">runoff</sub>. This gives an indication of the dam’s capacity to store the runoff generated over a year, i.e., if 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">reg</sub> &gt; 1, the dam can hold all runoff generated within 1 year, and if 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>
 <sub class="sub">reg</sub> = 0.5 the dam can hold half of the runoff generated within 1 year. The local degree of regulation at each dam was used instead of the accumulated degree of regulation per river as the connectivity between dams on the same river basin was not available in open global databases.
