<p id="Par31" class="p">When modelling climate change impact, we used a state-of-the art modelling chain to assess the climate change impact in hydrology. The S-HYPE model was forced with transient time-series from downscaled and bias-corrected output from an ensemble of climate models for the period 1961–2100. To estimate climate change impact, the river flow at the end of the century (2068–2098) was compared with a reference period (1981–2010) for each ensemble member. We used CMIP5 projections for the representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, respectively, from the following nine Global Circulation Models (GCM): CanESM2, CNRM-CM5, GFDL-ESM2M, EC-EARTH, IPSL-CM5A-MR, MIROC5, MPI-EMS-LR, NorESM1-M, HadGEM2-ES. Each of the GCMs was dynamically downscaled from 1000 to 50 km by the RCA model
