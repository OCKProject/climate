<p id="Par28" class="p">The Method to predict non-regulated and naturalised flow (QN) made use of current approach to model lakes in S-HYPE. The model set-up has 9082 non-regulated lakes explicitly modelled at sub-basin outlets. Lake routing is modelled by establishing rating curves from observed discharge and lake-water levels. These are either explicitly determined from observations (from various time-periods) in individual lakes, calibrated group-wise using downstream gauges or for regions, or by using a general rating curve

 </sup>. When simulating non-regulated conditions, assumptions about such natural rating curves for original lake outlets must be made for sites with lake regulation today. For 30 major reservoirs, we established a specific rating curve to describe naturalised flow based on measurements of water discharge and lake level fluctuations, either by observations prior to regulations or by using reconstructions made by hydropower companies, which are currently used for legal justifications in the water court. For the 476 remaining lakes, we used the equations for the spillways from regulated conditions. Naturalised flow was then modelled by using these new rating curves and removing all regulation storages and man-made diversions in the model. Three man-made lakes were removed completely and replaced with forest on till soil.
