<p id="Par30" class="p">The HYPE modelling of naturalised flow was evaluated against more detailed independent reconstructions based on observed water levels for eight reservoirs across Sweden (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). All stations showed NSE &gt;0.7, except the highly regulated Seitevare, which has a rather small drainage basin and 85% flow regulation with intense short-term fluctuations. We explicitly tested the model predictability of hydropower impact, by studying the effect itself in the HYPE-model compared to observations vs. reconstruction, there was normally a good agreement with a median NSE = 0.71. The performance was related to degree of regulation and upstream lake area. The sites with high flow regulation showed low NSE values and poor skills were also noted at the outlet of Lake Vättern (Motala), which is a very large lake compared to the drainage basin that feeds the river. The dampening of the hydrograph, higher influence of evaporation, and long-term fluctuations in lake water make it more difficult to reach a high NSE at the outlet. In addition, the outflow of Lake Vättern is more affected by short-term regulation than by seasonal re-distribution of the flow. In addition to statistical criteria, the model performance for various sites was also evaluated by plotting flow duration curves and time-series
