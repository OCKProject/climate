 </sup> is a national multi-basin model system for Sweden that covers more than 450,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and produces daily values of hydrological variables in 37,000 catchments from 1961 onwards. The spatial resolution is on average 10 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and it covers the Swedish landmass, including transboundary river basins with Norway and Finland. The model is used operationally for water management and the national warning service for floods and droughts. Most catchments are ungauged, but observations are available in 400 sites for model evaluation of daily water discharge and 86% of the river flow from land to the sea is monitored. A number of model-performance criteria are estimated in each site, e.g., Nash and Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)

 </sup> and relative error. The latest S-HYPE version (2012) has on average daily NSE = 0.83 for 222 stations with ≤ 5% regulation and an average relative volume error of ±5% for the period 1999–2008. For all gauging sites with both regulated and unregulated rivers, the mean monthly NSE = 0.80. Average NSE includes catchments ranging from a few to several tens of thousands of km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and various land-uses across the country. The S-HYPE model provides different kinds of water information and open data to Swedish water authorities and the public, free to download from the web site:
