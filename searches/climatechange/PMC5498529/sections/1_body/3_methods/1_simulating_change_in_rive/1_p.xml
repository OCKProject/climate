In both cases, we used daily values for the reference period 1981â€“2010 to evaluate effects of change. The total effect of redistribution of flow between seasons was calculated by comparing 30 years averages for each day between naturalised flow for the reference period with 30 years averages for each day during river regulation and climate change conditions, respectively.
