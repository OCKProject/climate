<p id="Par26" class="p">The method to predict regulated flow (QR) made use of current approach to model regulation in S-HYPE. The model set-up includes 509 regulated lakes and reservoirs, and 23 man-made river diversions leading water over catchment borders. Each regulated reservoir or group of reservoirs is treated separately, with individual storage volumes as input data. The model simulates the alteration of river flow in a conceptual way by water storage from spring and summer to hydropower production during autumn and winter. The seasonal production pattern is estimated individually from observations of discharge and water levels. This was done explicitly for some 50 gauged dams, and group-wise for some 400 lakes and reservoirs upstream of river gauges. Some small dams are modelled by using a general regulation routine

 </sup> with the following function: (i) when the water level is low production is reduced, (ii) at moderate water levels the outflow only depends on the time of the year, (iii) when a dam is nearly full, discharge occurs through the spillways. The spillway flow is modelled by a rating curve, which is calibrated separately using the same observations as when estimating the seasonal production.
