<p id="Par32" class="p">In total, the impact from 18 climate projections were then simulated by using the unregulated version of S-HYPE to create an ensemble of projected river flows. The total flow from land to sea was compiled as well as river flow from selected rivers with less regulation. The results were quality assured by comparing results with previous estimates of climate change impact in Sweden. The S-HYPE results for unregulated flow for the reference period (1981–2010) were not identical when comparing the model forced by observations with the mean of forcing from climate models (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This was because the the bias correction was done for the period 1961–1990, which allowes the climate signal to differ between models (and to observations) from 1990 and onwards.
