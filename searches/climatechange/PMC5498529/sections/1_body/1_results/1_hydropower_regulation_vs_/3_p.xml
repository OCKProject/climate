<p id="Par10" class="p">Additional changes to the flow regime resulting from climate change are that the spring peak starts about 1 month earlier and there will be about 10% more discharge on an annual basis. These trends have been documented in previous studies of Sweden

 </sup>. However, the increase in annual flow cannot be extrapolated to all snow-dominated regions. These changes are caused by more precipitation in total over Sweden, but also vary spatially within Sweden with some areas getting dryer

 </sup>. It should be noted that the projected climate changes in temperature, governing evapotranspiration and timing of snowmelt, are much more robust than the predictions of future precipitation (including snowfall

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup>), which are uncertain and show large variability in space and time.
