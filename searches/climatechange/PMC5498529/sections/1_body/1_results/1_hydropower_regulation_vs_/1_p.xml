<p id="Par8" class="p">In a detailed reconstruction of natural flow regimes across Sweden, we found that current hydropower production has a significant impact on the seasonal distribution of flow, not only locally but also at the national scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). The flow peak (mean annual maximum flow) was found to be reduced by 15% and the seasonal redistribution of total river flow to the sea amounts to 19% for an average year. This number includes runoff from the whole country (also unregulated rivers) and is caused by the storage of snowmelt in reservoirs, especially in the mountains. The flow duration curve also shifts towards smaller differences between high and low flow for regulated conditions

 </sup>. The rivers of Sweden have been exploited for large-scale hydropower productions since the early 20th century. The development of hydropower production capacity was a major contribution to the industrialisation of Sweden and amounts today to half of the electricity supply for the country, as well as an additional value in terms of meeting energy-demand peaks. There are ~1800 hydropower plants in Sweden, of which some 200 produce &gt;10 MW, providing 94% of the total hydropower production. The total annual production varies from 50 to 75 TWh due to variability in the annual water inflows, with an average of 65 TWh/year.
