<p id="Par9" class="p">A surprisingly similar pattern of change is found when projecting climate change impact for the same geographical domain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>), using a climate model ensemble with 18 members (including RCPs of 4.5 and 8.5). By the end of the century (2069–2098), 19% of the total river flow is again seasonally redistributed by a changed climate, due to less snow storage and more precipitation falling as rain. However, the flow peak is reduced by only 5% due to global warming, which gives a combined total effect for surface runoff (both regulated and non-regulated rivers) of flow peak reduction of at most 20%, if the hydropower dams are operated similarly in the future as they are today.
