<p id="Par11" class="p">The changes observed in Sweden are also significant on a global scale, for landmasses where river-flow generation is controlled by snowmelt, hydropower and temperature change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). We assume similar water management for the snow-dominated parts of the world because hydropower production is favourable and there are similarities in climate, hydrology and energy demand. Snowmelt is stored in hydropower reservoirs, to be released at other times of the year. The snow-dominated part include mountains, which have the best energy potential for hydropower (most precipitation and head) where the snow storage thus contains a lot of accumulated energy. We found the fraction of precipitation falling as snow to be indicative of flow regime changes due to hydropower (see Methods section). The country of Sweden (450,000 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in Northern Europe, represents regions with 10–60% of the precipitation falling as snow. Globally, we found that a large part of the Earth’s land surface also has 10–60% of precipitation falls as snow (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). Hence, the river regime in these areas is controlled by snowmelt as in Sweden. In these snow-dominated regions of the world, the river flow is regulated by some 2200 major hydropower reservoirs

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) according to global data, while the actual regulation (including small dams) may be much higher. Sweden has an average or below average degree of regulation (i.e., altered capacity to store the water runoff, see Methods section). Most of Northern USA, Canada, Europe and some isolated areas of the Asian continent have similar degrees of regulation as Sweden.
