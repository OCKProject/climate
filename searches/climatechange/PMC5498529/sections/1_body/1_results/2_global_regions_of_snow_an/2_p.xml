 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The temperature in snow-dominated regions is projected to rise by 2–4 °C by the end of the century, assuming stabilising green-house gas emissions (RCP = 4.5)

 </sup>. The projected temperature increases in Sweden are similar to the projected average temperature rises for other snow-dominated regions according to IPCC. In accordance with previous findings, we assume that increasing temperatures are more important than precipitation changes for snowpack seasonality in a changing climate

 </sup>. In summary, the conclusions from the detailed modelling of Sweden are deemed representative for regions of snow and hydropower globally, when comparing changes of the natural flow regime caused by global warming and river regulation, respectively.
