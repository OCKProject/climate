<p id="Par15" class="p">The second region is the area downstream of the mountains at the floodplains near the outlet to the sea (east and southwest) where the rivers show less radical changes in flow regime, as there is a contribution also from unregulated discharge with natural peak flow. One exception is Luleälven River (No. 2 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), which has a total regulation degree of 67% at the outlet and an almost constant river flow over the year.
