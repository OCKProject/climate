<p id="Par16" class="p">The third region includes large lakes (No. 9 and 11 in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), encompassing the largest and 6th largest lakes in the EU. The lakes control the flow by naturally damping and storing much of the peak flow from snowmelt. A more variable flow regime has thus been introduced by regulation of these large lakes, which normally would show rather constant flow.
