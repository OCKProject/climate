<p id="Par13" class="p">In the more detailed analysis, we found that the effects of hydropower regulation on flow regimes vary spatially and that this spatial variation can be linked to the main processes controlling river flow in different regions. At the local scale, the snowmelt peak vanishes often completely by regulation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and these rivers are associated with dry reaches and time-spells without any river flow, also at the time of the snowmelt (e.g., site No. 7 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The river response to regulation shows similarities and dissimilarities across the country and can be categorised into four distinct regions, as follows.
