<p id="Par18" class="p">This example of spatial analysis in Sweden helps us to identify the regions that are more or less influenced by climate change and hydropower regulations, respectively. Such mapping can help decision makers to allocate measures for climate adaptation where they would be most effective. Climate adaptation should be targeted to where it can make a difference, and for instance floodplains are identified as areas retaining relatively high ecological status in a European perspective, worth protecting

 </sup>. Hydropower regulation could be used in these areas for artificial flooding of floodplains to secure biodiversity in a future climate. The spatial mapping also identifies rivers where there are other potentials for improvements, for instance through more collaborative regulation strategies or rules to use the water resource for many purposes, including biodiversity aspects. Thus, different adaptation strategies in different rivers or river reaches will help us to better design the measures needed for sustainable development.
