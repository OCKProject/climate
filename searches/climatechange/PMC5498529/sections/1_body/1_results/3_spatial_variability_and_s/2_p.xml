<p id="Par14" class="p">The first region is the rivers in the mountains (northwest), which show most radically changed flow patterns with some completely reversed regimes, e.g. the Upper Indalsälven River (no. 7 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These reservoirs have relatively small drainage areas and often regulation degrees of more than 100%, which means that more than a year’s discharge can be stored and released according to energy demand. The natural peak flow from snowmelt has disappeared completely as regulation controls basically all river flow.
