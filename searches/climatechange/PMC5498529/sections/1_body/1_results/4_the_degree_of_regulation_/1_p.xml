<p id="Par19" class="p">We have shown that hydropower regulation radically changes the river regime for the whole surface of Sweden and conclude that similar effects are likely in other snow-dominated parts of the world, which is in line with reports from regulated and snow-fed rivers on other continents

 </sup>, because the degree of regulation is normally not well documented in a transparent way and local water management remains unknown, especially in open national and global databases. Hence, there is currently a knowledge gap in understanding the impact of this factor on large-scale river flow and in scientific analysis on global change. For instance, when going from the global database GranD

 </sup> to the national database of S-HYPE
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup> for Dalälven River in Sweden, the number of regulated lakes and reservoirs shifted from 1 to 42, which increased the degree of regulation by a factor of three (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). An even more detailed local database further raised the degree of regulation from 21 to 23% when including many small constructions. The implications of this are that regulations are neglected in most large-scale assessments of climate change impacts on water resources

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>–

 </sup>, which are not representative for dynamics of hydropower regulation. More attention must thus be put on documenting and sharing information on reservoir regulation and including these processes in large-scale modelling studies, to better judge their relative impacts on water security in a global change context.
