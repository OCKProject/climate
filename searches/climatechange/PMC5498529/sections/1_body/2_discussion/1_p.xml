<p id="Par20" class="p">Our findings clearly demonstrate that the common assumption of pristine hydrological conditions leads to wrong conclusions regarding on-going global changes and the impacts on large-scale river flow. We therefore show the benefits from using dynamic models that integrate both climate variability and detailed reservoir regulation. Climate change is not the main driver but regulations have significant control of river regime in snow-dominated regions, not only locally but also at the landmass scale. The ignorance among climate and hydrological scientists is because the degree of regulation is normally not well documented, kept secret or considered difficult to simulate. Neglecting or underestimating the degree of regulation will unconditionally lead to wrong conclusions when analysing global-change impact on large-scale river flow. Our results thus imply that scientists should be very careful when estimating changes to future river flow regimes until regulation can be properly addressed in the analysis. We thus urge for more complete and open global databases on flow regulation, and water management for integrated and detailed modelling at the global scale. New techniques using satellites and crowd sourcing could also be helpful here.</p>
