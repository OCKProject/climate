 </sup>. Our detailed mapping of flow regulations for a large landmass indicate that the radical change from natural flow regime in mountains would be difficult to restore. We therefore recommend more attention to downstream areas and floodplains that receive water flow also from unregulated parts of the river network. In these areas, we found that climate change will have about the same impact as hydropower regulations. Hence, climate change will have more severe consequences on present status of biodiversity in floodplains, and it might be worth to introduce artificial flooding for climate adaptation in these regions. The regulations could thus help in climate adaptation, but there may be high costs for energy loss and melt-water must still be available in sufficient amounts from snow storage.
