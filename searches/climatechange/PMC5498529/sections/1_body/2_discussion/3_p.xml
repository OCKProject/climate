<p id="Par22" class="p">The hydropower sector is also subject to future change. It is not yet known how climate change will impact the regulation schemes for power production, as timing of both water supply and energy demand changes. With lower spring flows, reservoirs may need less storage capacity and would thus affect natural flows less. On the other hand, electricity demand may also change over time and reservoir storage may be used to balance out fluctuations in other renewable power sources, such as wind and solar.</p>
