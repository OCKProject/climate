<p id="Par6" class="p">More than 20 years ago it was noted that 77% of the river discharge from the northern part of the world is affected by fragmentation of the river channels by dams and water regulation

 </sup>. It is recognised that this water regulation has severe effects on ecosystems and societies close to the reservoirs, for instance due to dry river channels, flow obstacles, changed flow patterns and short-term fluctuations of water level

 </sup>. However, the accumulated effect on large-scale flow regime further downstream remains unknown as it is difficult to measure and separate from natural variability. Previous studies comparing climate change and regulations have therefore been limited to single reservoirs or rivers
