 </sup>. More precipitation falling as rain in snow-dominated regions and shorter freezing periods will thus give less differences in river flow between seasons. Hydropower production can have the same effect on the flow regime. During spring, the river water is stored in dams and reservoirs often to be released throughout the year whenever electricity is needed most. Thus, the high flow of the snowmelt season is dampened and redistributed to other times of the year. It is known that the main drivers of change in river-flood regime include river channel engineering, land use and climate change
