<p id="Par4" class="p">A large part of the Earthâ€™s land surface receives precipitation in the form of snow. During the cold part of the year in high latitudes or high altitudes, the water is stored as snow and ice, which fully or partly melts during the spring. The seasonality in flow from such snow-fed rivers is therefore characterised by low flow during the winter followed by a high spring peak flood event. The hydromorphology, ecosystems and societies along floodplains, lakes and shorelines in these regions have evolved over time to benefit from these flow dynamics. Examples are migratory fish, ecosystems and cultivation practices, which have evolved to benefit from the natural spring flood.</p>
