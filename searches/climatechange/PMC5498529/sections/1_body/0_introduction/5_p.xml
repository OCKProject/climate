<p id="Par7" class="p">Here, by using a detailed numerical modelling approach, we systematically quantify and compare hydropower impact with the effects of climate change across multiple rivers, from sources to the sea. We conclude that at the large scale and for floodplains in snow-dominated regions globally, hydropower regulations and climate change have about the same effect on flow regimes. Downstream of large reservoirs, however, hydropower regulations affect flow regimes much more than climate change. Overall, flow regulation should thus be key in adaptation measures for a sustainable future of snow-fed rivers and deserves much more attention by policy makers and climate-impact scientists. Our findings show that climate-change impact on flow regime is relevant in floodplains, which experience less impact from hydropower regulation (being further downstream from reservoirs). In line with the findings, we might need to reconsider the relative importance of on-going global changes and adjust adaptation measures and research accordingly.</p>
