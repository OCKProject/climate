<p class="p">In rainfed production systems that are characteristic of the watershed and SSA in general, crop growth and yield are closely related to the LGP. Across SSA, inadequate LGP is one of the major constraints to establishing rainfed sequential cropping systems. In this study, we have demonstrated that increasing drought risk due to climate change will considerably reduce the LGP across the study area. Due to the reduction in LGP, substantial areas in both cultivated and uncultivated areas hitherto suitable for rainfed sequential cropping will revert to single cropping. Cultivated and uncultivated areas that can currently support single cropping will still be suitable in the coming decades. However, the number of crops that can be cultivated (especially long-cycle crops such as cassava and yam) will be limited as a result of the shortening of the LGP. Our analyses show that currently about 60,000ha (40%) of cultivated areas in the study area are suitable for sequential cropping (including relay cropping). It is difficult to ascertain if all of these areas are actually used for sequential cropping due to inadequate data. However, the average cropping intensity of staple crops such as maize, yam, cassava and sorghum in the study area is 1.5, i.e. the harvested area is one and a half times greater than the physical area devoted to the cultivation of each crop [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. This can be attributed to both sequential cropping and intercropping. If all 60,000ha of suitable sequential cropping areas in cultivated areas are currently used for sequential cropping, then in the coming decades, farmers will have to shift to either single cropping systems or adopt crop cultivars with shorter growing periods. To a degree, the impact on crop production may be mitigated by agronomy including breeding of drought resistant varieties. If, however, a substantial portion is only used for single cropping, then climate change will severely limit such opportunities for increasing crop production. In both situations, substantial reductions in sequential cropping areas may result in relatively greater rainfed cropland expansion to make up for lost opportunities to increase crop production.
