<p class="p">In this study, we computed irrigation potential from a water resources perspective, i.e. assuming water availability was the only limiting factor for irrigation and all other socioeconomic, biophysical and technological factors were non-limiting. The irrigation potential reported in this study, therefore, is the maximum irrigable land area because, in practice, other physical and socioeconomic factors will be constraining. Our approach reflects the fact that renewable water resources that are adequate for irrigating a given amount of land today may not be so in the future as a result of climate change. Moreover, unlike water availability, many other limitations may be overcome in the future depending on the socioeconomic development pathway. Hence, analysing the impact of climate change on maximum irrigable land area from a water resources perspective is instructive and important for long-term irrigation development planning. Our irrigation potential estimates were computed using rice as a proxy crop for crop water demand. Rice is currently the only staple crop grown on irrigated fields in the watershed. Compared to other crops, rice has a relatively high water demand especially if measured on a per hectare basis (as opposed to a per kg of produce basis). Hence for other crops, our approach underestimates the irrigation potential. Our model can be adapted in a relatively simple way to assess the amount of other crops that can be irrigated.</p>
