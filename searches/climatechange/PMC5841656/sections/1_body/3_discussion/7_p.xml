 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Under current climatic conditions, there is considerable potential for irrigation expansion. A maximum land area of 27,000ha can be irrigated even after household water demands and environmental water requirements have been implemented. However, our study has shown that future opportunities for irrigation expansion will be heavily constrained by increased severity, frequency and duration of streamflow droughts. Streamflow droughts coupled with increased household water-use due to population growth and socioeconomic development will result in increased competition for surface-water resources. Where household and environmental water requirements are prioritized over irrigation as in this study, streamflow droughts will substantially reduce the irrigation potential of the watershed. Potential cropland expansion into currently forested areas will also affect seasonal distribution of streamflow further reducing irrigation opportunities especially in the critical dry season [
