<p class="p">In our analysis, we used the same land-cover and soil parameters for simulation of the watershed hydrology under both current and future climatic conditions. This is one of the main sources of uncertainty in our study. Land-cover dynamics affect actual evapotranspiration and together with soil properties influence the partitioning of rainfall into overland flow and soil infiltration. Incorporating plausible land-use changes could impact on our analyses in a variety of ways and the net effect on streamflow depends on the types and extent of land-use changes. For example, conversion of forests and woodlands for crop cultivation reduces dry season streamflow and consequently water available for irrigation [

Nevertheless, by maintaining these watershed characteristics constant, we were able to isolate the impacts of climate change on watershed hydrology from the impacts of plausible land-use changes. We excluded the effects of elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide under future climatic conditions in our analysis, which is another source of uncertainty. The effect of changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide on watershed hydrology is incorporated in the SWAT model through a modification of the Penman-Monteith equation for computing potential evapotranspiration [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] to compute potential evapotranspiration because of inadequate data to apply the Penman-Monteith equation. Elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide has countervailing effects on the transpiration rate of vegetation cover. On one hand, it reduces transpiration rate by reducing leaf stomatal conductance [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>]. On the other hand, it increases transpiration rate by stimulating plant growth [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>]. Their net effect on the magnitude and seasonality of the components of the hydrological cycle depends on local weather conditions and vegetation characteristics. For example, in forested watersheds of the northern Coastal Ranges and Sierra Nevada mountain range in California, research has shown that elevated carbon dioxide concentrations reduced evapotranspiration by around 3% and consequently increased streamflow [
