<p class="p">We also used the scenario matrix approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] to analyse the impacts of climate change based on RCPs and socioeconomic development based on SSPs on the irrigation potential of the watershed. It has been pointed out that the radiative forcing projected under some RCPs may be inconsistent with the socioeconomic assumptions described in some SSPs i.e. certain SSPs may not produce the level of greenhouse gas emissions needed to achieve the level of radiative forcing in certain RCPs. However, such inconsistencies occur only at the global scale of analysis. At the local and regional scales, all possible combinations of RCPs and SSPs may be possible. Because 1) the global-average level of radiative forcing described in each RCP may differ from those at the local and regional scales due to a number of factors, including land-use change and air pollutant concentrations [
