<p class="p">In this study, we used multi-model ensemble climate data projected by 17 GCMs for simulation. In using multi-model ensemble data, extreme climatic values projected by individual GCMs are smoothed. To maintain the climate extremes, climate data from individual GCMs with divergent climatic trajectories can be used. However, in West Africa, where these projections are highly uncertain especially for precipitation, and there is a large spread across various GCMs [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>], using climate data projected by individual GCMs may not address the structural uncertainties and independent simulation errors in these models. In these situations, multi-model ensemble data are highly recommended and have been widely used [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The multi-model ensemble approach have been reported to outperform individual ensemble members in hindcasting studies and thus provide an improved ‘best estimate’ forecast [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Lambert et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>] showed that simulations of multi-model ensemble data of precipitation, temperature, and pressure of current climate are generally closer to observed distributions, as measured by mean squared differences, correlations, and variance ratios, than the results of any particular model. Yira et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>] show that as a result of the high uncertainties in precipitation projections in West Africa, a larger ensemble of climate projections is required to estimate the impacts of climate change on water resources accurately. Giorig et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] suggest that as a result of these uncertainties, a minimum of four to five multi-model ensemble is needed to obtain robust regional precipitation change estimates.
