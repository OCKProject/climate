<p class="p">Over 90% of the total suitable sequential cropping area is currently not under cultivation and lies in the forested south-western part of the watershed. In these areas, the higher soil water-holding capacity allows for relatively longer LGPs and the impact of climate change is relatively less. However, most of these potentially suitable sequential cropping areas are presently either forested or are woodland savannahs. The forested areas are essential for biodiversity conservation, wood resources, water flow regulation, carbon sequestration etc. and the woodland savannah areas provide grazing opportunities for livestock. Particularly during the dry season, pastoral communities from other parts of Benin and neighbouring countries, such as Nigeria, often migrate here for grazing [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is likely that forested and woodland savannah areas will be increasingly under pressure from land use change in the coming decades. Among others, this may cause tensions between pastoralists traditionally using the areas for grazing and new settlers. Land use changes in the Upper Ouémé watershed are also likely to affect population growth and per capita water use. These feedbacks are, however, not included in the present study and it would be very challenging to do so in the scope of one paper.
