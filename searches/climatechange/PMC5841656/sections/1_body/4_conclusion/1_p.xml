<p class="p">In this study, we have shown that, in addition to crop yield responses, climate change will affect other options that have been used to increase crop production in recent decades in SSA i.e. rainfed sequential cropping, rainfed cropland expansion and irrigation expansion. Currently, about 41% of cultivated areas in the Upper Ouémé watershed are either used for rainfed sequential cropping or can support it. However, by 2050 this will decrease to between 2% and 16% depending on the climate change scenario. Farmers will therefore have to shift to single cropping systems or adopt improved agronomic practices including drought-resistant and short-cycle cultivars. Farmers may also be driven to expand to hitherto uncultivated areas to make up for lost opportunities to increase crop production. In the Upper Ouémé watershed, over 90% of the land area that can support rainfed cropping is not currently under cultivation and largely consists of forest and woodland savannah. This situation is unlike other parts of Benin where the availability of currently uncultivated land is much lower. A large part of these potential arable lands will still be able to support rainfed sequential cropping in the coming decades despite the loss of between 15 and 30 growing days due to their relatively higher soil moisture storage. If these areas are to be used for rainfed sequential cropping, then fallow periods will have to be shortened or lost completely and improved soil and nutrient management will be needed to increase productivity. However, in a previous paper, Duku et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>], we showed that the conversion of forested and woodland savannah areas to cropland will have negative feedbacks on water availability for irrigation. In the present study, we have shown that even if there is no change in forest cover, at least 50% of irrigation potential will be lost in the coming decades due to climate change. Forest and woodland areas, therefore, will be needed to regulate water flows and increase dry season streamflow in addition to the provision of other ecosystem services. Our paper shows the importance of using an integrated approach to rural development planning, where climate change can be expected to have multiple, major implications on cropping systems and resilience for climate change depends upon maintaining overall landscape integrity including areas that regulate water flows.
