<p class="p">In SSA, sequential cropping in rainfed areas has been one of the ways of increasing crop yields (in addition to intercropping) and involves cultivation of two or more crops on the same field after each other or with overlapping growing periods (relay cropping) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Already, sequential cropping in rainfed systems large parts of SSA is constrained by the length of growing period, high labour intensity, lack of knowledge and lack of market access [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. In the coming decades, detailed information on how climate change will affect sequential cropping in both cultivated areas and in potential arable areas will be vital to reduce agricultural vulnerability to climate change.
