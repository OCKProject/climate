<p class="p">Increasing crop production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is urgently needed. The population of the region is projected to double by 2050 compared to 2015 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. About 97% of current cropland area is under rainfed cultivation [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>] and current productivity levels for major food crops, which are the lowest in the world, are inadequate to meet the projected food demand [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. To meet the food demand of a growing population several options for increasing crop production must be harnessed. These include amongst others crop intensification in rainfed systems to produce higher yields and/or increased cropping frequency, expansion of irrigated area and rainfed cropland expansion. Over the past decades, higher yields, increased cropping frequency (i.e. sequential cropping and intercropping) and cropland expansion have accounted for an estimated 38%, 31% and 31% respectively of the recorded increases in crop production in SSA [
