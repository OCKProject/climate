<p class="p">In addition to cropping frequency, increased application of irrigation water is vital to boosting crop production and meeting the food demand of a growing population in SSA [

However, changes in precipitation and temperature are not only likely to affect water availability for irrigation but also irrigation water requirements of major food crops in SSA. Furthermore, population growth and socioeconomic development are also likely to increase water demand and hence increase competition for water use. Hence, to support agricultural development and planning, there is a need for detailed information on how climate change and socioeconomic development will jointly affect irrigation potential. Yet, despite numerous studies examining the impact of climate change on water resources in general [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], studies specifically examining the impacts on the capacity to support irrigation expansion are rare in SSA.
