<p class="p">In the coming decades, climate change will affect these various options for increasing crop production. West Africa in particular has been identified as a regional hotspot of climate change with climate departure from historical variability projected to occur faster than the global average [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Changes in precipitation and temperature will pose serious risks to crop production systems and food security in general [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. Several studies have examined the impact of climate change on crop yields in SSA. For example, in Benin, reduced rainfall and increased rainfall variability is likely to result in yield reductions in maize and yam [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>] and, in Niger, climate change will reduce millet production between 11% to 26% by 2025 [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. A variety of mechanisms drive impacts of climate change on crop yields. For example, in Tanzania, climate change is likely to intensify rice diseases such as bacterial leaf blight leading to greater yield losses [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Climate change will also affect irrigated agriculture in the Sahel region where, yields of irrigated rice systems are projected to decline by up to 45% by the 2070s [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Across SSA, aggregated mean yields for major food crops are forecasted to decrease by 6% to 24% by the end of this century [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. However, focussing on crop yield responses alone underestimates the impact of climate change on agriculture in SSA. For example, in a key agricultural region in Brazil, analyses of the sensitivities of crop yields, cropping frequency and cropping area to inter-annual climate variability showed that about 70% of the total change in agricultural output in the region could be attributed to changes in cropping frequency and/or cropping area [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. In SSA, to date, information on the likely impacts of climate change on 1) rainfed cropping frequency in cultivated areas; 2) potential arable land; and 3) the irrigation potential are rare.
