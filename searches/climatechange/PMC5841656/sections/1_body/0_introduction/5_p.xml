<p class="p">Therefore, to provide a better understanding of the varied impacts of climate change on opportunities for increasing crop production, we examine three potential options for increasing crop production in a large sub-humid tropical watershed in central Benin, the Upper Ouémé watershed. First, we analyse the impact of climate change on the potential for increasing rainfed cropping frequency through sequential cropping in cultivated areas. Second, we analyse the impact of climate change on the suitability of potential arable land areas for rainfed sequential cropping. Finally, we analyse the combined impacts of climate change and socioeconomic development on the potential for irrigation expansion in the watershed taking into account household water demand and riverine environmental flow requirements, which are the two major non-agricultural water uses in the watershed. Our approach combines hydrological modelling and scenario analysis involving two contrasting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), two water-use scenarios for the watershed based on the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), and environmental water requirements leading to sustained water flows in the Upper Ouémé river network.</p>
