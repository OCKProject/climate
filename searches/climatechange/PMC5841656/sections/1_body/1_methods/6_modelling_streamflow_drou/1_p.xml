<p class="p">Streamflow droughts affect the availability of water for irrigation and other consumptive purposes. We used two approaches to compute streamflow droughts; the Standardised Streamflow Index (SSI) [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>] and Severity-Duration-Frequency curves (SDF) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. The SSI approach is similar to the SPEI methodology, however, in this case a non-parametric probability distribution was fitted to the time-series of monthly streamflow totals simulated at the watershed outlet [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Unlike the SSI approach, the SDF approach involved daily streamflow simulated at the watershed outlet and streamflow droughts occurred when streamflow was below a specified threshold for at least a specific period of time (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]). We used the environmental water requirements of the river as the threshold level. The environmental water requirement is critical for sustaining the natural functioning of riverine ecosystems during periods of high flow in the wet season and low flow in the dry season. We defined the environmental water requirements separately for each month as the streamflow value with a 75% exceedance frequency (Q75) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>]. We estimated these threshold levels based on flow duration curves under baseline climatic conditions. For example, the Q75 value of the month of August was 138 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> whereas the value in November was 22 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>s
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>. See
