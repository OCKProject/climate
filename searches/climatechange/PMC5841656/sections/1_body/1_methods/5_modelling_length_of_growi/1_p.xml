<p class="p">The length of growing period (LGP) indicates the potential for rainfed crop production. We modelled the LGP as the number of days in a year in which moisture supply (i.e. the sum of daily precipitation and plant available soil water content) was equal to or exceeded potential evapotranspiration and temperature was above 5°C (e.g. [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>] is that plant growth and development will only occur if the temperature exceeds some minimum threshold. For our study area, which is located in tropical lowlands, the year round minimum daily temperature always exceeds 5°C. Hence, the limiting factor in the computation of LGP was moisture supply. The SWAT model was used to simulate daily soil moisture content for the computation of LGP. The computed LGPs were then used together with the criteria in
