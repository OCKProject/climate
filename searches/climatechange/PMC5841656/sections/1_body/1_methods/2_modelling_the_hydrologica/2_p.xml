<p class="p">The grid-based SWAT landscape model used in the present study to simulate hydrological response of the watershed under current climatic and future climatic conditions had been set up, calibrated and validated in Duku et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The input data used to set up the model are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192642.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The Soil Conservation Service curve number approach was used to model surface runoff and the daily curve number value was calculated as a function of plant evapotranspiration [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] and potential evapotranspiration was modelled with the Hargreaves method [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The model was calibrated and validated using daily observed streamflow data from 11 monitoring stations within the watershed (See

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. Calibration was mostly from 2001 to 2007 and validation was from 2008 to 2011. Calibration and validation of the model was carried out using the Sequential Uncertainty Fitting (SUFI-2) optimization algorithm of the SWAT Calibration and Uncertainty Program [
