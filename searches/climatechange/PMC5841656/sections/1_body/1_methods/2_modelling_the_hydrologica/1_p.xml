<p class="p">To simulate the hydrological response of the watershed under current and future climate conditions, we used a modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), which had been reconfigured with a grid-based landscape discretization [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] and further enhanced to simulate water flow across the discretized landscape units [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. The SWAT model in general is a spatially explicit, physical, ecohydrological model that simulates the impact of land use and land management practices on water, sediments and agricultural chemicals in large complex watersheds with varying soils, land use and management conditions over several years [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>] from the standard Hydrological Response Units (HRUs), enhances the spatial detail and accuracy of simulated hydrological processes [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. Furthermore, a landscape routing sub-model was incorporated to enhance the spatial interaction between discretized landscape units and allowed for the simulation of surface water, lateral and groundwater flow interactions across these units. Detailed information about the grid-based SWAT landscape model description can be found in Rathjens et al. [
