<p class="p">We estimated the irrigation potential from a water resources perspective i.e. assuming surface water availability was the major limiting factor [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. We created a matrix of RCPs and SSPs, where each RCP was characterized by 1) the simulated total streamflow in excess of the Q75 threshold level and 2) potential evapotranspiration (crop water demand); and each SSP was characterized by 1) irrigation efficiency, 2) population growth and 3) per capita domestic water use (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0192642.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Irrigation potential (in hectares) was computed as the quotient between total volume of streamflow available and irrigation water requirement [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. The volume of streamflow available for irrigation was computed using 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0192642.e001" class="xref">Eq 1</xref>. The total irrigation water requirement was computed as the quotient between crop water demand (using rice as a proxy crop) and irrigation efficiency. We used rice as a proxy crop for crop water demand because rice is the most commonly irrigated crop in Benin. Furthermore, land-use data with the required level of detail to distinguish between different crops in croplands are currently unavailable. Obtaining such information is complicated by the small plot sizes and cropping patterns varying from year to year. We discuss the implication of the use of rice as a proxy crop for water demand in Sect. 4,.
