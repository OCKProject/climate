<p class="p">We characterised meteorological drought conditions under each RCP scenario using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. The SPEI methodology estimates the severity and frequency of meteorological drought by accounting for changes in evapotranspiration demand caused by changes in temperature in addition to precipitation. It is based on a probability distribution fitted to a time-series of the difference between monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration (i.e. climatic water balance) aggregated over different time-scales using a moving window (e.g. 3-month, 6-month etc.). This probability distribution is transformed to the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution (with a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1). In this study, the regional (i.e. average over the entire watershed) monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration time-series were used. Potential evapotranspiration was computed using the Hargreaves method [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. The sequences of climatic water balance in the baseline and for the 2040s and 2090s in each RCP scenario were used to compute the 6-month (seasonal drought) and 12-month (annual drought) SPEIs.
