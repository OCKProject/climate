<p class="p">For simulations under climate-change scenarios, we obtained downscaled monthly precipitation totals, and maximum and minimum temperature data projected under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5; and for two time-periods i.e. 2041–2050 (2040s) and 2091–2100 (2090s). Daily precipitation and temperature data are the outputs of multi-model ensemble of 17 General Circulation Models (GCMs) (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0192642.s002" class="xref">S2 File</xref>) and were obtained from the MarkSimGCM geoportal (

The MarkSimGCM geoportal is part of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) research program on Climate Change Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS). In MarkSimGCM, fifth-order polynomials are fit to climate anomalies between the baseline [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] and each GCM future climate prediction. Cubic convolutions are then used to interpolate to smaller grids of about 1 km resolution. These intra-GCM differences are then added to the baseline data to provide monthly averaged climate data at each grid cell [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. To produce multi-model ensemble data drawing from all 17 GCMs, the polynomial functions that were fitted to each individual GCM were averaged and not the climate data produced by the GCMs, which would have led to a progressive dilution of the variance as more GCM models were added. A detailed description of the downscaling and bias correction approach can be found in [
