<p class="p">To generate the daily time-series of climate data needed to run the SWAT model, we used the change factor approach [

 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. The change factor approach involves the calculation of the relative changes in monthly precipitation and the absolute changes in temperature between the multi-model GCM data and the baseline climate data for each time period (i.e. 2040s and 2090s) under each RCP scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The change factors were calculated separately for each of the 44 subwatersheds of the Upper Ouémé watershed (the SWAT model assigns one climate station to each subwatershed based on the nearest neighbour) [
 <xref rid="pone.0192642.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. The calculated changes were used to perturb the baseline climate observations in the calibrated and validated grid-based SWAT landscape model. In simulating watershed hydrology under each RCP scenario, the effect of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration was not taken into account. We discuss the implications of excluding increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide in Section 4.
