 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192642.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). The SSPs are a set of alternative reference assumptions about future socioeconomic development in the absence of climate policies. The SSP1 scenario depicts a development pathway characterised by rapid economic development especially in low-income countries leading to rapid technological development, increased resource use efficiency and low population growth whereas SSP3 represents a scenario with slow economic growth, slow technological development, low resource use efficiency and rapid population growth. In this study, each SSP was characterized by three variables; population growth, irrigation efficiency, and per capita domestic water use (
