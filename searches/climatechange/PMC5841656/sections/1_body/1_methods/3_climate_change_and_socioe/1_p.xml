<p class="p">For the present study, simulations involving daily time-steps were undertaken for the period from 2003 to 2012. This represented the current climatic conditions henceforth referred to as the baseline conditions. To simulate the hydrological response of the watershed under future climate scenarios, climate data (precipitation and temperature) projected under two contrasting Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) were utilized. RCPs encompass four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories adopted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and supersedes the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios projections [

It represents a peak in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 followed by a consistent decline throughout the rest of this century. It is the pathway needed to realize the targets set during the twenty-first Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, i.e. keep mean global warming to within 2Â°C above pre-industrial levels. The RCP8.5 scenario, on the other hand, is characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions leading to the highest concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gases by the end of this century [
