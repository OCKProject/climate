<p class="p">SPEI values are the number of standard deviations by which the anomaly in climatic water balance deviates from the long-term mean. Our SPEI analyses clearly show a substantial shift from relatively wetter climatic conditions under the baseline to increasingly drier climatic conditions under both RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios (
