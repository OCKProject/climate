 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192642.g008" class="xref">Fig 8</xref> shows the irrigation potential of the watershed under different combinations of climate change based on RCPs and socioeconomic development based on SSPs. It shows that the irrigation potential is likely to be at least halved under all combinations of future climatic conditions based on RCPs and socioeconomic development based on SSPs. This can be mainly attributed to reduced precipitation and increased temperature resulting in reduced water availability for irrigation and increased irrigation water requirements. Even though increased irrigation efficiency under SSP1 compared to current conditions may reduce the irrigation intensity, this reduction cannot completely offset the effects of climate change and to a lesser extent population growth.
