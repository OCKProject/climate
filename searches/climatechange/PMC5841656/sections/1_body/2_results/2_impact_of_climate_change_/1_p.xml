<p class="p">Our analyses show that a watershed-wide average of between 15 and 30 growing days will be lost depending on the climate change scenario. Despite the loss of growing days, cultivated and uncultivated areas that currently are used for single cropping or can support it will still be suitable depending on the type of crop cultivated. However, substantial areas of hitherto rainfed sequential areas will only be suitable for single cropping (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192642.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). Depending on the climate change scenario, between 50% (30,000 ha) and 95% (57,000 ha) of cultivated areas that are currently used for rainfed sequential cropping or can support it will only be suitable for single cropping (Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0192642.g005" class="xref">5</xref>). In currently uncultivated areas, between 10% and 60% of the areas where rainfed sequential cropping is currently feasible will only be suitable for single cropping. Currently over 90% of areas that can support sequential cropping in the watershed, i.e. over 570,000 ha, are not under cultivation and lie mainly in the forested south-western part of the watershed (
