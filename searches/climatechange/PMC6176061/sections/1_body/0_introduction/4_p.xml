<p class="p">We summarize the major results of literature reviews and meta-analyses on the quantitative responses of tree PSCs to specific CC-related abiotic factors, with restriction to literature up to 2015 in

  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2</xref>
 </bold>. Recent results of PSC (after 2015) and plant VOC (after 2012) research are then reviewed. We then discuss the roles of multiple CC-related stresses on PSCs of forest trees and the potential of non-volatile and volatile PSCs to modulate plant adaptation to CC and their involvement in climate feedback.
