<p class="p">At the global level, climate change (CC) is strongly linked to increasing CO

At the regional scale, global warming affects arctic and boreal areas most strongly and will include drastic changes, e.g., in precipitation, drought, and cloudiness (shading), affecting temperature-dependent ecosystem processes in forests such as nutrient availability (
