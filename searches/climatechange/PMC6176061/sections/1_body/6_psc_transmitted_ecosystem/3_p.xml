<p class="p">Volatile PSCs have several functions in the species interactions affecting herbivores and their natural enemies and activating defenses in healthy plants (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blande et al., 2014</xref>). CC factors also affect herbivore-induced volatiles, but studies on forest trees and woody plants remain limited (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Holopainen and Gershenzon, 2010</xref>). Non-volatile PSCs released from plant leaf and needle litter accumulate in soil and affect C or net N mineralization in forest soils (e.g.,

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> did not affect concentrations of total phenolics and MTs in 
 <italic class="italic">P. sylvestris</italic> needles, but at elevated O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> resin acids were increased. However, during decomposition this difference in needle litter was lost (

 <italic class="italic">B. pendula</italic> growing at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> concentrations, several phenolic compounds were elevated, and the growth of juvenile earthworms was reduced (

 <italic class="italic">Alnus incana</italic> litter, UV-A and UV-B exclusion affected concentrations of phenolic groups variably, whereas in birch litter there were no significant differences in phenolic compounds (
