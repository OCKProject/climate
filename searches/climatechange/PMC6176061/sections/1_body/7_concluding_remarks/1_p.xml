<p class="p">There is strong evidence that CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases phenolic compounds in foliage, but limits terpenoids in foliage and emissions, while warming decreases phenolic compounds in foliage, but increases terpenoids in foliage and emissions. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in combination with other abiotic stresses has more variable effects. As current PSC information is mostly from tree seedlings, long-term experiments covering the whole ontogeny of trees in forest ecosystems are needed to better understand CC effects on PSCs in trees. Assessment of the role of volatile PSCs in sun-screening and non-volatile PSCs in control of decay rate of carbon storage in dead wood will be necessary to improve our knowledge of the capacity of PSCs to mitigate CC. Transgenic trees with silenced or over-expressed genes for key volatile PSCs (
