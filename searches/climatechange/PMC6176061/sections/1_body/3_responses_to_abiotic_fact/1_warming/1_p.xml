<p class="p">Warming is one of the most intensively studied factors in volatile PSC studies (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010</xref>), due to VOC emissions being strongly light and temperature dependent and some, e.g., isoprene not being stored in leaves (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sharkey and Yeh, 2001</xref>). At the global scale, isoprene represents nearly 50% of the estimated biogenic VOC emission, and emissions of MTs and SQTs together comprise about 15 and 3%, respectively (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guenther et al., 2012</xref>). Warming increased emissions of volatile terpenoids most consistently (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010</xref>) by stimulating biosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Loreto and Schnitzler, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fini et al., 2017</xref>) and temperature-dependent release from leaf storage structures (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Grote and Niinemets, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Peñuelas and Staudt, 2010</xref>). VOC emissions from storage structures are high in conifers, e.g., over 40% in 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic>, and very low in deciduous trees (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghirardo et al., 2010</xref>). Differences in emission responses of MTs and SQTs to temperature might be caused by temporal storage of less volatile SQTs in leaf surface waxes (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Joensuu et al., 2016</xref>), and their temperature-dependent adherence and release (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Himanen et al., 2015</xref>).
