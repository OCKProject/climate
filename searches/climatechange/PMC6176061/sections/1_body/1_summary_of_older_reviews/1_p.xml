<p class="p">Terpenoids and phenolic compounds in leaves and terpenoids in emissions are the most frequently studied PSCs of forest trees in response to CC-related factors (

 </bold>). Major CC factors such as elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and warming have the most distinctive, and often contrasting effects on PSCs. Greater availability of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increases phenolics in foliage and reduces terpenoids both in foliage and in emissions, while warming reduces phenolics in foliage and increases terpenoids in foliage and emissions (

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> effects on foliar concentrations of terpenes and volatile emissions have been variable, but increased phenolic compounds have been found. One reason for variable responses of terpenes could be within-species variation in O
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> sensitivity (

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> reactivity of terpenes (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blande et al., 2014</xref>). Major terpenoid groups such as monoterpenes (MT) and sesquiterpenes (SQT) in foliage have been less studied separately under most of the other CC related stresses.
