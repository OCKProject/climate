<p class="p">Short-wave (280â€“315 nm) UV-B radiation induces tree foliage to produce more phenolic acids and flavonoids as protective pigments (

 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> in mountains lead to lower flavonoid concentration, but increased salicin in leaves, and salicylates and total phenolics in stem (

 <italic class="italic">Salix myrsinifolia</italic> to 32% elevated UV-B in a field site did not result in significant changes in flavonoid concentrations, and in male trees total salicylates were even reduced (
