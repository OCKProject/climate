<p class="p">Reduction in foliar phenolics at elevated temperatures (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Julkunen-Tiitto et al., 2015</xref>) has been explained by a dilution effect whereby more carbon was allocated to growth supporting structures with turnover of phenolics slow or even absent (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kosonen et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that warming reduces flavonoids (
