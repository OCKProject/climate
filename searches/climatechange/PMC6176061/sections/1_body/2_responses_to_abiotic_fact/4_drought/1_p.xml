<p class="p">Drought in warm periods is expected to become the most frequent widespread climatic extreme that negatively affects terrestrial ecosystems (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwalm et al., 2017</xref>). Forests in southern Europe will face stronger summer drought than those in the north (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ruosteenoja et al., 2018</xref>). The observed trends in PSCs are not strong, although reduction of some terpenes and phenolics have been reported (
