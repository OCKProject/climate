  <p class="p">Global climate change – related abiotic and biotic stresses and their influence on types of plant secondary compounds (PSCs) in forest trees. Ecosystem level feedbacks transmitted by leaf PSCs are indicated with arrows on the left from the target tree. PSCs in foliage provide chemical defenses against herbivores and pathogens (
   <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lämke and Unsicker, 2018</xref>). PSCs of leaf and needle litter affect mostly on tree nutrient uptake (
   <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smolander et al., 2012</xref>) and rhizosphere organisms while PSCs in deadwood are part of important carbon storage (

   <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Blande et al., 2014</xref>), while reactive VOCs affect the atmosphere and may have atmosphere-biosphere level feedbacks in the surrounding ecosystems (
