  <p class="p">Summary of the results in comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses of plant PSCs responses in their concentration or emissions in forest trees under climate change related stresses. This tabulation covers nearly 400 original scientific articles. Type of stresses: O
   <sub class="sub">3</sub> = elevated ozone, CO
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> = elevated carbon dioxide, UV-B = elevated UV-B radiation. The tabulation gives the direction of PSC responses to single environmental factors, except for the combined O

Arrow direction (increase or decrease) shows the effect size (significant or highly significant effect in meta-analysis) or the amount of evidence in reviews. Horizontal bidirectional arrow indicates the studies with non-significant results and up and down arrows in the same cell indicate significant results in both directions dominate. Question mark indicates that the reviews and meta-analyses did not provide enough data. Gray arrows in CO
