<p id="Par45" class="p">The Inverse Poisson Functional has been compared in 
 <italic class="italic">ex-ante and ex-post fits</italic>. The model is in direct agreement with the historical time-delay data for CFC emissions onset and the ratification of the Montreal Protocol. The model therefore gives reasonable fits to global pollution events for chlorofluorocarbons and to a lesser degree for sulfur and nitrous oxides emissions. The model also predicts a decrease in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> levels in 80 years and a 95% CI spread of 55−120 years. Observations of emissions scenarios from past events can be used in a statistical model to extrapolate and therefore predict future peaking of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. The statistical model presented here allows for a method relatively independent from IAMs to determine the global reaction time to climate change and presents a view based on observation. Some scholars take a more normative approach to CC, assigning a damage to emissions in IAM simulations and therefore curbing emissions faster
