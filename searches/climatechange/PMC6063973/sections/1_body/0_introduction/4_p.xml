These models also include simulations of both the social science side (e.g., demographics, political, and economic modeling that affect greenhouse gas emissions) and the physical side (e.g., energy transfer, atmospheric, land, and ocean models that determine how and to what degree temperatures rise). IAMs have been used to explore economic scenarios and future CO
