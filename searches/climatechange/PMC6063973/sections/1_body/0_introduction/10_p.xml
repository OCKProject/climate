<p id="Par13" class="p">The paper will show the similarities in the underlying distributions of natural and anthropogenic events and then will use this information to build a time-delay distribution. We develop an extrapolation of time-delay and show examples of forecasts from both past (
 <italic class="italic">ex-post</italic>) and future (
 <italic class="italic">ex-ante</italic>). The paper is arranged in the following way: Section 1 proposes a look at global disaster data, both natural and anthropogenic; Subsection 1.1 illustrates fit functions for raw-count data and the time-delay data; Subsection 1.2 presents a model of time-delay; Subsection 1.3 presents 
 <italic class="italic">ex-ante</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ex-post</italic> forecasts. Finally, we present results (Section 2) and discuss interpretations (Section 3).
