<p id="Par10" class="p">Given these challenges, this paper aims to focus on the progression of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions in light of the historical evidence. We propose a descriptive approach to understanding the global behavior of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions based on the cost-of-impact and the time required for the actual curbing of emissions as a result of measuring the mean response time of environmental impacts of similar costs. In other words, we propose that the delay of 
 <italic class="italic">substantial</italic> mitigation to anthropogenic pollution is related to the time-delay of damage; the mitigation delay connects to the level of cost-impact from natural or anthropogenic disasters. We define substantial in this work by mitigation that curbs emissions so that concentration no longer increases, but begins to decrease (or at least levels to zero increase). Observation of environmental events, both natural and anthropogenic leads to the following two equivalence propositions:

    <italic class="italic">The distributions of natural environmental events and anthropogenic accidents emanate from the same parent population and are defined by Poisson statistics</italic>.

   <p id="Par12" class="p">Proposition 2 
    <italic class="italic">Emissions are the equivalent of a set of anthropogenic events; when the peak of emissions (highest impact cost) can be identified, it can also be analyzed statistically as an event</italic>.
