<p id="Par35" class="p">Climate change can be considered a continual set of events that theoretically leads to a single concentration peak of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. By using the assumption that pollution events are intrinsically a series of anthropogenic events, starting from small emissions and leading to an eventual peak, we were able to use historical data and extrapolate to make a forecast. This was achieved by using 
 <italic class="italic">ex-post</italic> comparisons with large-scale events (CFCs, SO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and NO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) and then to making the natural extension to an 
 <italic class="italic">ex-ante</italic> prediction for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. Given sufficient statistics at a cost level, Poisson distributions could be generated and extrapolated to high costs, namely the high cost of CC. Also, the study showed that within a 95% CI, the time delay of natural events and anthropogenic accidents is similar and therefore statistics could be combined from both data sets, improving the accuracy of the extrapolation.
