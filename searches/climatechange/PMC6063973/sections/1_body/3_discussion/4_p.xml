<p id="Par38" class="p">When considering pollutant delay times, chemical lifetimes of GHGs also needed to be considered. Two metrics are often used to measure atmospheric gas lifetimes. Global mean lifetimes (GML) characterize the time required to turn over the global atmospheric burden (teragrams of pollution divided by the mean global sink, teragrams/yr, for a gas in steady state)

 </sup>. A second metric is the perturbation lifetime (PLT), a measure of the time where anomalous levels of, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, for example, remain in the atmosphere; PLT is also the time required for a fractional reduction to 1/

 </sup>. For completeness, both GML and PTL values are considered whenever possible. Chlorofluorocarbon GMLs range from 10 to 100 years: CFC-11 (F11) 45 years, CFC-12 (F12) 100 years, HCFC-22 11.9 years, CFC-113 85 years and nitrous oxides 120 years (GML) years or 114 years (PLT)

 </sup>. No single lifetime can be defined for CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> as there are several processes that remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. “Between 65% and 80% of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> released into the air dissolves into the ocean over a period of 20–200 years. The rest is removed by slower processes that take up to several hundreds of thousands of years

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the troposphere are a few days

 </sup>. Extended gas lifetimes cause damage impact to be extended. This fact is taken into account by measuring the concentrations of species. Longer lifetimes result in a slower decrease of the pollutant concentration as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>. Similarly, even if CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions were stopped completely and instantaneously, the delay time would cause a fairly slow decrease for pre-industrial levels. According to a study funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, “Within a millennium of this simulated shutoff, the carbon itself faded steadily with 40 percent absorbed by Earth’s oceans and land masses within 20 years and 80 percent soaked up by the end of the 1,000 years”
