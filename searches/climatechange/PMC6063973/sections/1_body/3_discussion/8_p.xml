<p id="Par42" class="p">The study also looked at the global situation. By viewing the ’big picture’, we remove the small-scale issues that make global projections more challenging (e.g., except for the largest polluters,  individual nation’s policy decisions to either favor or not favor low carbon emissions are individually too small to be considered in this model). However, we do not imply that individual nation’s efforts are not important. According to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report, “Effective mitigation will not be achieved if individual agents advance their own interests independently”

 </sup>. The results of this study are therefore consistent with the IPCC’s assessment that cooperative effort is mandatory. “Collective and significant global action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to keep global warming below 2 °C. The report also states “that the longer we wait, the more expensive and technologically challenging meeting this goal will be”
