The increase will not be linear as a function of CO

According to an assessment by the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, “Mitigation costs will exceed the avoided damage in the short term, but eventually, the benefits of reduced climate change will outweigh the mitigation costs.” From the same report, “In the second half of this century, without mitigation efforts, adaptation costs are likely to increase sharply, and large residual damage will remain unsolved, as adaptation can only reduce them to a certain degree”
