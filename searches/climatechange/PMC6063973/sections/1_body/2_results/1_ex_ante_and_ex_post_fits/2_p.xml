 <italic class="italic">ex-post</italic> fits. Comparisons made with large-scale natural events including Hurricane Katrina, 2005 (USA); the Great Thailand Flood of 2012 (Thailand); a San Diego Wild Fire of 1998 (USA); and a moderate storm with damage of 0.5 million (2014 USD levels). Anthropogenic accidents include the Chernobyl Nuclear event, 1986 (USSR, present-day Ukraine), the Deepwater Horizon Accident (DWH), in 2010 (USA) in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM), and a moderate industrial accident with damages of 0.5 billion USD (2014 adjusted). Costs for events were obtained from the International Disaster Database (EM-DAT). The delay time Δ
