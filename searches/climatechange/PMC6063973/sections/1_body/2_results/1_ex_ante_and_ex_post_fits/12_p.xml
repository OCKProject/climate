<p id="Par34" class="p">Only after considering a cascade of consequences can the cost of CC impact be determined. IAMs have been developed to make these calculations, and generally, the critical issues are the projected levels of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions such as methane, nitrous oxides, as well as CFCs. The latter three gases are much more potent regarding global warming potential but are also significantly less present in the atmosphere
