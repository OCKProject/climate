<p id="Par23" class="p">The IPF is plotted for both natural and anthropogenic data in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>. Some specific natural events and man-made accidents are indicated in each figure. A series of statistical tests were conducted to produce an optimal set of fits. First, cost-cuts that gave insufficient statistics were filtered. Systematic tests were conducted to find a best filter cut for all three data-sets, natural, anthropogenic and combined. Poisson fits were improved when cuts had at least 100 counts and low-cost values inferior to 30 were filtered. Low statistics data (counts inferior to 100) accounted for 22% of the Natural data. By applying the cut, the standard deviation (SD) 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>, improved from 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 18.4 (raw data) to 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 5.38 (filtered). Similarly, 17% of the anthropogenic data had low statistics and when applying these two cuts, (SD) improved from 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 10.0 (raw data) to 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 6.22 (filtered), and combined data improved from 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 14.6 (raw data) to 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic> = 6.23 (filtered). Increasing the count filter above 100 did not significantly improve the fits for any of the three data sets. For comparison, unfiltered data are shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>.
