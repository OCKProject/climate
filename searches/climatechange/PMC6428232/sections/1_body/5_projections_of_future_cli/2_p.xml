 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" class="xref">136</xref>], although it is difficult to separate the cause from the effect. A similar relationship is also found for the Ural blocking. Such consistency, however, has not been reported over the Pacific, suggesting that multiple and perhaps competing factors are contributing to Pacific blocking changes, in agreement with the larger disparity of model projections in this region. Reduced Pacific winter blocking has been related to a weakened and poleward-shifted Hadley circulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130" class="xref">130</xref>] and more El Niño (less La Niña) events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128" class="xref">128</xref>]. While individual models do not support a link with ENSO changes, ensemble projections with prescribed warming in the equatorial Pacific reveal consistent decreases in winter Pacific blocking for a variety of future ENSO responses [
