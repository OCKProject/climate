 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102" class="xref">102</xref>], our analysis of conventional blocking indices does not identify robust hemispherical trends over this longer period. Moreover, regional trends in blocking frequency (e.g. the positive summer trend in Greenland blocking, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">103</xref>]) are also seen to vary depending on the index. One potential risk in identification of trends such as these is that the geopotential height is affected by warming in the column underneath, and so increases in the height do not necessarily imply changes in the statistics of synoptic flow. Previous work has also shown that trends in blocking are not generally robust over longer periods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>], and even the satellite era is still a relatively short period over which to distinguish potential anthropogenic trends from natural multidecadal variability. We conclude, therefore, that clear long-term changes in blocking frequency have not emerged from the internal variability in recent observations.
