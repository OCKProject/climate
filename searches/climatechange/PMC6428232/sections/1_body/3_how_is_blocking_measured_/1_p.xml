<p id="Par20" class="p">The range of systems interpreted as blocking, as shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, has led to a diversity of blocking definitions. This makes the comparison across studies not straightforward and raises concerns on the sensitivity of the results. All objective blocking methods determine local and instantaneous blocked conditions on a gridded field using a so-called blocking index. Additional criteria are imposed to ensure that the blocking events have minimum spatial extension, quasi-stationarity and persistence (typically 4 or 5 days). The employed datasets vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions, the meteorological variable (geopotential height or materially conserved PV-based dynamical fields) and the vertical level (500 hPa, the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere or the dynamical tropopause). Although upper tropospheric fields may better capture blocking in all seasons [
