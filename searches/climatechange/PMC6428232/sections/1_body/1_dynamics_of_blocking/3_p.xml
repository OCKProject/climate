 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">26</xref>]. One important aspect is that the cyclone moves slowly so that air mass trajectories can travel a long way polewards within the warm sector. An excellent example occurred at the beginning of October 2016 where a slow-moving rapidly growing cyclone southwest of Iceland contributed to downstream ridge building (Fig.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] for more detail on this example and the connection with reduced predictability). However, in observed cases, it is difficult to establish cause and effect since the large-scale ‘steering flow’ approaching the block region before onset is often weak, perhaps due to a change in the planetary-scale conditions, which would slow cyclone propagation and enhance meridional extension. This implies that the synoptic-scale eddies and planetary-scale background flow are often tightly coupled in blocking onset. As an additional complexity, the relative importance of synoptic-scale and planetary-scale forcing varies regionally [
