<p id="Par35" class="p">Despite overall disappointing progress in representing European blocking in a multi-model mean sense, the existence of a small number of models with reasonable blocking behaviour offers considerable opportunity. Some studies have identified a small subset of models with reasonable blocking structures and frequencies (within about 20% of the observed) and exploited these for more targeted investigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121" class="xref">121</xref>]. These are also typically the models for which mean state biases can account for much of the remaining underestimate in blocking. Despite the presence of biases, the relationship between extreme temperature and blocking is often captured by models, at least when large ensemble simulations are used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>]. An additional cause for optimism is that blocking biases are slightly weaker in summer than winter for some regions (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>]), when the association with heatwaves makes blocking of particular concern in a warming world. Some bias does remain, however [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108" class="xref">108</xref>], and further work would be welcome to investigate this, as many studies continue to focus on winter events only. Insights to reduce biases in climate models could be gained from the experience with prediction models. As a result of recent improvements to forecasting models, impressive skill is evident in probabilistic predictions of blocking and related weather regimes in the medium range [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>] and even in some cases on the seasonal time scale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">125</xref>]. Forecasts can be highly skillful once a blocking is established but predicting the onset of blocking can still be challenging ([
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>,
