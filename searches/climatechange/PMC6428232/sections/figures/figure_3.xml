  <p class="p">Blocking biases. Multi-model mean (MMM) bias in (top) winter and (bottom) summer blocking frequency (shading, in percentage of days in the season) for the 1961–1990 period: (left) anomaly method (ANO), (middle) absolute method (ABS), (right) hybrid method (MIX). Bias is defined as the difference of blocking frequency climatologies (1961–1990) between the corresponding historical run and the ERA-40 reanalysis. Contour lines depict the ERA-40 blocking frequency climatology (2% intervals starting at 2%). Biases are only displayed over regions with climatological blocking frequencies above 1% in the ERA-40 reanalysis. Black dots denote regions of model disagreement on the sign of the bias (i.e. less than two thirds of the models displaying the same sign). CMIP5 models (one member per model): BNU-ESM, BCC-CSM1-1, BCC-CSM1-1-M, CanESM2, CCSM4, CMCC-CESM, CMCC-CM, CMCC-CMS, CNRM-CM5, FGOALS-g2, FGOALS-s2, GFDL-CM3, GFDL-ESM2M, HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES*, IPSL-CM5A-LR, IPSL-CM5A-MR, IPSL-CM5B-LR, MIROC5, MIROC-ESM, MIROC-ESM-CHEM, MPI-ESM-LR, MPI-ESM-MR, MRI-CGCM3, NorESM1-M. *The 1981–2005 period is used instead as historical period</p>
