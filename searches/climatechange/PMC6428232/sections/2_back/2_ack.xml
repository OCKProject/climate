 <p class="p">This paper was stimulated by an international workshop on atmospheric blocking in April 2016 with over 100 participants. Giacomo Masato instigated the workshop and it was taken forward by members of the WMO World Weather Research Programme’s WG on Predictability, Dynamics and Ensemble Forecasting (PDEF) with sponsorship from WCRP/SPARC, IAMAS/ICDM, NCAS-Climate, ERC, and the Universities of Bern and Reading. We thank Ben Harvey as the local organiser for the workshop, hosted by the University of Reading, and Ted Shepherd for his ERC support. We would like to acknowledge David Barriopedro for the analysis presented in Figs.
