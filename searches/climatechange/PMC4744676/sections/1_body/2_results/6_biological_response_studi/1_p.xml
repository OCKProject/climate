<p class="p">We examined 545 biological responses from the 311 highly cited studies investigating potential biological changes (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). Nearly 30% of these responses were measured in laboratory settings, but this varied greatly among biological subdisciplines and themes. For example, &gt;50% of the biological responses among fish, archaeo‐, bacterio‐, and phytoplankton were measured in the laboratory compared to ≤5% for mangroves, birds, mammals, and turtles, clearly reflecting differences in tractability of experimental manipulations. For 85% of the biological changes examined in our database, the authors concluded that their results could be attributed to physical or chemical changes in the marine environment. Other factors, such as anthropogenic activities (e.g., fishing) or habitat degradation, were sometimes considered. It was not the goal of this review to assess confidence in the attribution of climate change impacts on marine systems, although other studies have addressed this issue extensively (e.g., Poloczanska
