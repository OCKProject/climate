<p class="p">A variety of responses were examined across each of the biological themes within eight general categories: reproductive fitness (e.g., number of offspring produced), physiological effects (e.g., calcification rate, stress hormone response), phenological shifts, changes in distribution or range shift, dietary effects (e.g., body condition, diet, foraging preferences), changes in community structure (e.g., species composition), behavioral effects (e.g., antipredator response), or changes in population abundance and demography (e.g., recruitment rate, number of individuals). A single study examined evolutionary adaptation as a function of change in population growth (i.e., Lohbeck

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), which was included as a demographic response. Physiological changes (31%) and changes in abundance (30%) were most frequently reported (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), followed by shifts in reproductive fitness (12%). The remaining five categories each constituted &lt;10% of the responses reported. Physiological responses were most frequently measured in benthic communities, and nearly half (47%) were measured in the laboratory. Abundance studies were more evenly divided among the biological subdisciplines (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a) and were examined by all themes, but with varying frequency (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). Notably, changes in abundance were the main response studied by all themes in plankton communities. Dietary effects were not considered in any of the benthic communities studies included in this review, yet nearly all plankton and vertebrate studies examined dietary effects. Vertebrate studies exhibited the greatest diversity of biological response types, with turtle and bird studies often focusing on reproductive success and phenology more than any other themes.
