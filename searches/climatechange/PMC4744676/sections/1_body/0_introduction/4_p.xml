<p class="p">Our goal was to address these questions by reviewing the types of data available to detect changing ocean conditions across multiple marine disciplines, identifying disciplinary trends, and detecting areas where discourse on marine climate change has been lacking. We reviewed highly cited, contemporary literature on ocean change to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current discourse on climate change in marine environments. Specifically, we considered the following: (1) geographic scope of ocean change studies, (2) the spatial and temporal scales used to describe ocean change, (3) the oceanographic stressors implicated in biological responses, (4) the types of biological responses reported, and (5) field observations vs. laboratory manipulations. Our review encompasses hundreds of physical, chemical, and biological observations representing 19 specific research foci, or ‘themes’. We believe that enhanced recognition and understanding of discipline‐specific differences and data limitations in ocean change research, as revealed by this review, will improve interpretation and communication of contemporary changes in marine ecosystems. No previous syntheses of marine climate impacts, to our knowledge, have examined in similar detail such a wide range of research foci among several marine disciplines. In particular, our comparison across biological and physical/chemical realms is a novel approach that helps identify key disciplinary differences that may affect interpretation of ocean change research. Our interdisciplinary approach reveals research areas worthy of expansion. For example, we suggest geographic regions that provide unique opportunities for more integrated studies considering multiple stressors, standardization of biologically meaningful metrics when synthesizing spatial and temporal scales of ocean change, and expanded support for interdisciplinary training and efforts.</p>
