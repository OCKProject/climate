<p class="p">Ocean change studies addressing the biological effects of physical or chemical changes (i.e., those in the benthic, vertebrate, and plankton subdisciplines) often measured multiple biological response variables or included responses for more than one species. Therefore, we also cataloged each biological response reported. For each biological response, we recorded the number of stressors examined in each study, categorical data on the physical or chemical factor(s) driving the response (referred to here as a ‘stressor’) and type of biological response examined (see Table S1). In cases where multiple stressors were examined, we focused on the primary stressor identified by the author(s). We grouped stressors and responses into categories typically considered in studies of marine ecological responses to climate change (e.g., Brierley &amp; Kingsford,
