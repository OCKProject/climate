<p class="p">We focused our review among disciplines by classifying papers into two major groups: (1) those that addressed changes in the abiotic domain, consisting of papers on aspects of physical or chemical oceanography (referred to here as the ‘physical/chemical’ discipline), and (2) those that addressed changes in the biotic domain. We further divided the biotic domain into three subdisciplines, based on differences in process, species composition, and scale: (1) plankton communities, (2) benthic communities (specifically, macroalgae, seagrasses, mangroves, and invertebrates), and (3) vertebrates. We then subdivided the abiotic and biotic groups into 19 specific research ‘themes’ (see Table 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>) for more thorough examination: 5 within the physical/chemical discipline and 14 within the three biological subdisciplines to span the range of marine taxonomic groups from the smallest (viruses) to the largest (mammals).
