<p class="p">We selected our themes to represent a broad range of taxa and several lines of inquiry in physical/chemical oceanography, aiming to capture the most highly cited literature shaping contemporary scientific discourse on ocean change. Ocean acidity, temperature, sea level, sea ice, and dissolved oxygen are signals of climate change in global oceans (Doney

Our categorizations of biological subdisciplines aimed to broadly define useful taxonomic groups and ecological distinctions. We focused on the smallest‐bodied organisms at the lowest trophic levels (i.e., ‘plankton communities’) as well as the largest‐bodied organisms at the highest trophic levels (i.e., ‘vertebrates’) in pelagic systems. Our ‘benthic communities’ subdiscipline focused on organisms intermediate in size and trophic level, as well as ecological communities typically studied in coastal environments.
