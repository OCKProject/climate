<p class="p">Recent discussions on the state of global oceans are often marked with mounting concerns for the fate of marine species and communities (e.g., McCauley

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) argue for increased scrutiny of the available evidence for “ocean calamities” and suggest that several observation and citation biases may lead to an unsupported perception of ocean condition. The goal of our study was to examine the current discourse on changing ocean conditions across multiple marine disciplines, identify disciplinary trends, and determine areas where discourse on marine climate change has been lacking. We provided a novel cross‐disciplinary approach and reviewed a wider breadth of topics than previous syntheses, examining the nuanced intricacies of physical and chemical processes as well as biological impacts across research foci.
