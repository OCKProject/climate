<p class="p">Our review of highly cited marine biological responses yielded only one paper (i.e., Lohbeck 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) explicitly studying evolutionary implications of ocean change. Changes in gene frequency, via processes such as evolutionary or genetic rescue, are an increasingly recognized response to climate change (Carlson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The persistence of populations experiencing environmental change has been linked to individual performance regarding phenotypic plasticity, dispersal, and/or adaptive evolution (Merilä &amp; Hendry, 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), which can be categorized as acclimatization, colonization, adaptation, or extinction (O'Connor 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We documented population‐level responses corresponding to acclimatization (i.e., phenological, behavioral, diet, and physiological responses), colonization (i.e., distribution shifts), and avoidance of extinction (i.e., via reproductive or demographic responses) in the highly cited marine literature. In contrast, we found a general lack of studies on adaptations (i.e., changes in gene frequency), except for a selection study conducted on multiple generations of a coccolithophore in the laboratory (Lohbeck 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, we reviewed no studies confirming adaptive evolution in the wild. Attribution of genetic changes to climate forcing requires intensive common‐garden experiments or genetic time series that are rarely done or available, especially for long‐lived or large‐bodied species. The evidence for adaptive evolution in response to climate change, whether marine or terrestrial, is actually quite rare (Gienapp 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Rather, phenotypic plasticity is more apparent than adaptation (Hendry 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and has been investigated for marine species (e.g., Reed 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0075" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Kelly 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011a</xref>). Ultimately, future marine research could more acutely focus on the adaptive abilities of marine species to cope with changing conditions in order to better understand future population viability.
