<p class="p">Temperature may be a key factor interacting with other important abiotic mechanisms that warrant simultaneous investigation. Sensitivity to changing thermal regimes may set the physiological limits for responses by some marine species, but other factors like oxygen, acidity, upwelling, and salinity can also complicate predictions of climate impacts (Pörtner 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, a recent study demonstrated the importance of modeling interacting forces of acidification, temperature, and deoxygenation in understanding impacts on aerobic metabolic rates for teleost fishes (Del Raye &amp; Weng, 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Dissolved oxygen was rarely studied as a primary stressor in biological response studies despite being an important ecophysiological factor affecting many marine organisms (e.g., Dodds

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) that is susceptible to climate variations (Deutsch 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Hoegh‐Guldberg

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) suggest that understanding the effects of declining oxygen concentrations is an emerging research need. Our study indicates that long‐term, high‐resolution data on dissolved oxygen are less available to researchers compared to data on temperature, which may contribute to the apparent lack of dissolved oxygen as a stressor in biological response studies. Similarly, climate‐related changes in salinity and upwelling can strongly influence primary productivity, as well as the abundance and distributions of marine organisms (Hays 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Doney 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Understanding changes in surface winds may be critical to understanding regional upwelling processes and how upwelling contributes to hypoxia at varying depths or other important ecosystem effects of ocean–atmosphere interactions (Hoegh‐Guldberg 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Despite their regulatory influence on marine biota, salinity and upwelling were also poorly represented as primary stressors in our review of biological responses.
