<p class="p">Physiological responses were also frequently studied by the papers in our review, often in the laboratory and particularly for benthic communities. Of the 168 articles considering physiological responses, 63% investigated how OA was affecting processes like nutrient uptake or metabolism (phytoplankton, fish, seagrasses, kelp), tissue damage (fish), and calcification (rocky shore invertebrates, corals). Our findings suggest this focus on physiological effects is related to the recent proliferation of research on the effects of OA on marine species, especially calcifying organisms or those reliant on calcifiers (Orr
