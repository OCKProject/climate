<p class="p">Studies conducted over shorter time periods or lacking historical baselines have limited statistical power to demonstrate conclusively impacts due to climate (Edwards

 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Therefore, physical records, particularly the long duration and large spatial scale records for SST and sea level height, may ultimately have more statistical power to detect when a climate‐driven change has occurred. However, relating biological responses to physical changes is often complicated by mismatches in scale, sampling frequencies, or proximity of samples. The problem of pattern and scale (Levin, 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1992</xref>) is thus a key issue in attributing observed biological changes to climate (Rosenzweig 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0083" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Biological responses are measured at local, regional, and global scales relative to an assortment of climate measures (Garcia 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and confidence in the assessment of climate impacts on marine taxa is greatest for long‐term studies with fine‐resolution data (O'Connor 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) or those conducted on the scale of entire ocean basins or greater (Parmesan
