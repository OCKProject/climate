<p class="p">In addition to basin‐specific patterns, we found that approximately 20% of the highly cited ocean change studies were multiregional or global in scale, providing the potential for a more representative view of ocean change (Parmesan

 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, we also observed a trade‐off between geographic scale and sampling resolution (data not shown) for a number of studies in this review. Smaller‐scale environmental studies (&lt;10 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) often had increased sampling frequency (hourly–weekly) compared to studies that covered a greater geographic extent (greater than monthly or discrete sampling). Hence, while more localized studies may not be able to extrapolate findings to the basin or global scale (appropriate for ecosystem‐wide assessments), they may be better suited to estimate rates of change on more localized scales (e.g., discrete populations). There is also the potential for citation biases for large‐scale studies, where such studies may be cited more frequently due to their broad geographic representation and therefore more represented in our analyses. Indeed, multiregional and global papers had a mean number of 149.4 citations compared to 82.2 citations for all other smaller‐scale papers included in this review. The potential citation bias associated with large‐scale papers may be explained by uncritical or superficial citations (Banobi 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12978-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) when used in introductory sentences rather than more substantive citations used to augment interpretations and discussion of research findings.
