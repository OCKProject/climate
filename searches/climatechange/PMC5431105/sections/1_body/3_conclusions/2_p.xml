<p class="p">We found that changes in crop spatial distribution pattern affect the assessment of climate change impacts on corn yields. Changes in county-scale crop spatial distribution pattern can modulate the state-level corn yield response to climate change, with distinct impacts on the magnitude and even the direction at the state level. Averaged over the country, climate change has led to 2.5% decrease of corn yield for the historical period, which is reduced to 1.8% if accounting for the effects of corn growing pattern changes. The benefits are mainly achieved by reducing the adverse impacts of daily maximum temperature and strengthening the positive effects of precipitation. Whatâ€™s more, changes in crop spatial distribution pattern have played a more profound role in modulating the linear climatic effects than the non-linear climatic effects. Under future climate change scenarios, corn yields are projected to decrease 20~50% depending on emission scenarios, which could be reduced by ~10% after accounting for crop growing pattern changes.</p>
