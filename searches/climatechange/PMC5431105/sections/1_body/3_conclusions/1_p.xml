<p class="p">The impacts of climate change on crop yield have been extensively studied over the past few decades, but with limited attention on the effects of changes in crop spatial distribution pattern. In this study, we explore how changes in county-level corn spatial distribution pattern modulate the response of its yields to climate change at the state level over the CONUS.</p>
