<p class="p">Overall, our results indicate that previous empirical studies ignoring the changes in crop growing pattern would have overestimated the adverse climate impacts on corn yield over CONUS. The difference between estimated climate impacts with and without considering corn spatial distribution pattern is even comparable to the range among climate models, thereby introducing another important uncertainty source. A focus assuming constant spatial distribution pattern may therefore bias assessments of the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change. As a result, the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern are important to consider in impact studies, as they may affect both estimates of impacts as well as associated estimates of uncertainty. Despite the consensus that warming will likely have adverse impacts on agriculture in tropic and sub-tropic regions, there is continuing debates on whether warming will be a net loss or gain for agriculture in temperate regions like CONUS

 </sup>. By revealing the important least-understood uncertainty source from crop spatial distribution pattern changes, this study complement previous efforts for better understanding the link between weather and yields for crops grown in CONUS.
