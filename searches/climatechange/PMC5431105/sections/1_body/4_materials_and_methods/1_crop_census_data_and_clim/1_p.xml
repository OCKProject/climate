<p class="p">County-level corn yield and harvest area are obtained from the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Agriculture Statistics Survey’s Quick Stats database (http://www.nass.usda.gov/Quick_Stats). Historical climate data during 1970–1999 is based on the gridded observations, which include precipitation (Prec), daily minimum (Tmin) and maxim air temperature (Tmax) at 0.125 grid resolutions across the CONUS

 </sup>. We also use future climate projections under four Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) for 2021–2050. The climate projections are statistically downscaled to 1/8 degree resolution and bias-corrected against the observed climate over CONUS using the bias-correction and spatial-downscaling approach (BCSD)

 </sup> and are obtained from ftp://gdo-dcp.ucllnl.org/pub/dcp/archive/cmip5/hydro. There are a total of 97 climate projections under four RCPs. We didn’t rely on certain criteria to select a subset of climate projections. Instead, we used all the 97 climate projections in this study (Supplementary Table
