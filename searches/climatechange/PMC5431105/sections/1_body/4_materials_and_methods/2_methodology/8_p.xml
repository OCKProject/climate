<p class="p">We predict future changes in corn yields under a range of precipitation and temperature anomaly scenarios by 2050 s. We limit our projections to 2050 s because temperatures beyond this period are frequently beyond the range of historical temperatures used to fit the statistical models. Changes in Prec, Tmin and Tmax are computed for each of the 97 model simulations with weights based on the MIRCA2000 gridded corn area map and applied to the statistical model. Future crop yield estimates are compared to historical estimates, with inter-model standard deviation to indicate the range among climate models. Comparing the projected changes using the two statistical models has great implications for understanding the uncertainties in assessing future climate change impacts on crop yields.</p>
