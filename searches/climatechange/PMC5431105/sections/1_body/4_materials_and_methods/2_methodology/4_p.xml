<p class="p">By this, information on the changes in corn growing pattern between counties is incorporated. It should be noted that corn growing location within a specific county remain constant inheriting from the gridded corn area map since no dynamic grid scale maps are available. Thus, we investigate the effects of crop pattern changes between counties in modulating climate impacts on corn yield at the state level.</p>
