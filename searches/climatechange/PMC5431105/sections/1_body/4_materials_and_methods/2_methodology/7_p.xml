<p class="p">Here, we validate the statistical crop model based on the statistical significance (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value) and the model’s explanatory power as measured by the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>). A low coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) indicates the poor model performance in capturing the observed crop yield response to climate

 </sup>. Only those models that are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level (i.e. 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05) are included for analysis. And the coefficient of determination (R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) is provided in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>. We note that there are other ways to validate the statistical model, e.g. training the model with a subset of years and validating it using the remaining years of data

 </sup>. The model performance are then quantified by means of average error and/or correlation between predicted and ‘actual’ yields and etc. However, issues would occur as to which subset of 30-year census data should be used (e.g. 15 years) and the length of subset data would not necessarily meet the requirement of adequate power in the statistical regressions. In this study, we use the entire time series of crop yield and climate data to ensure adequate power of statistical relations and the approach we choose for model validation is well adopted and documented in statistical modeling of climate-crop yield relations

 </sup>. Here, the statistical models are fitted for a total of 41 states. The statistical significance of the regressions is calculated according to the two-tailed Student’s t-test. In 13 states, either one or both models are not statistically significant. Only those states (a total of 28 states, see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) where both models are statistically significant are selected for analysis. By comparing the results based on the two regression models, the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern changes between counties on state-level corn yield response to climate change can be quantified.
