<p class="p">To investigate the effects of crop spatial distribution change, we follows the logic of statistical modeling of crop yield response to climate conditions as follows. Typically, one of the key step in constructing the statistical model is to aggregate the gridded climate data into the administrative level, at which crop yield census is reported

 </sup>. This aggregation is conducted based on the weights given by a gridded crop area map, assuming that the relative distribution of crops in space has remained constant over the study period. We noticed that there exist time series of crop area data at the county scale in CONUS, which enable us to investigate the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern changes at the state level. In this study, two statistical models are fitted for each state, with one based on the newly generated transient crop maps and the other based on a fixed crop map. We note that there are potentially other approaches to explore the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern changes, e.g. incorporating the stability index into the statistical model. If choosing this approach, however, we may have to struggle with the definition of stability index and evaluate which stability index can better represent crop spatial distribution pattern changes and the associated uncertainties. This is evidently not within the scope of this study as this index is developed with the purpose of showing the evolution of crop spatial distribution pattern for each growing state, which is used to justify the following investigation of crop pattern change effects.
