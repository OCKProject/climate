 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 </sub>) indicating spatial distribution pattern changes in those states where statistically significant relations between climate and corn yield are constructed. Corn area has changed significantly with anomaly larger than one standard deviation for most states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). Specifically, annual corn areas exhibited an increasing trend before the year 1985 followed by decrease and then peaked in some states. Most of the increase in corn area concentrated during the period 1975–1990 with anomaly larger than one standard deviation, especially those high production states. Relative to the year 2000, the corn growing pattern between counties has exhibited distinct variations at the state level, with considerable changes observed in all investigated states (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Such changes in corn growing pattern are more pronounced (higher

 <italic class="italic">SI</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 </sub>) in highly productive regions such as Illinois and Iowa.
