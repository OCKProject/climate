<p class="p">Based on the crop model, recent climate trends have exerted an overall adverse impacts, resulting in a reduction of corn yield by 2.5% without adaptations, which is consistent with the estimates by Lobell

 </sup> Although historical observations have revealed a substantial change in corn spatial distribution pattern for the study period (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), this important factor has received limited attention to date. We show that with consideration of changing corn spatial distribution pattern, the negative climate impacts would reduce to 1.8%. Although the sampling uncertainty revealed by bootstrap resampling technique is large at the state level, our results show a clear difference in the estimated climate change impacts on corn yields at the state level by changes in crop spatial distribution pattern between counties. The reduced negative climate impacts also imply that the indirect role of climate change on corn yield through influencing crop growing pattern should be considered, although factors affecting crop growing pattern is not limited to climate conditions.
