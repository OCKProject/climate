<p class="p">Importantly, difference between the two models are observed due to the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern changes. Our results show that corn yield response to climate change varies with crop spatial distribution pattern, with distinct impacts on the magnitude and even the direction at the state level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Specifically, we found that, if not considering the changes of corn spatial distribution pattern, the positive effects of precipitation would be underestimated while the negative effects by Tmax would be enhanced. However, there are exceptions in some states, where the negative effects are enhanced with positive effects reduced after considering corn growing pattern changes. This may be due to the fact corn spatial distribution pattern is mainly determined by factors other than climate which are neglected in this study. The results demonstrate that climate change can influence crop yield not only by directly affecting the physiological response of crops to climate but also indirectly by changing the optimal land conditions and the subsequent shift of crop growing pattern, although the feasibility of these shifts would depend on a range of other factors, including topography, soils, agricultural management and competing land uses. Overall, one unit increase of precipitation lead to 5.9% increase of corn yield for the area-weighted country-mean, while the estimate is 4.2% by the model without considering crop growing pattern changes. For Tmax, the negative effects would be reduced from −5.7% to −3.9% per unit warming when the role of growing pattern is accounted for while minor effects are found in regulating the Tmin impacts. Notably, the beneficial effects of crop growing pattern changes are mainly achieved via modulating the linear climatic effects with negligible impacts on non-linear climatic effects (Fig.
