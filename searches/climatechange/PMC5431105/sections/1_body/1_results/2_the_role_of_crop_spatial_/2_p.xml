 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the sensitivity of corn yields to one unit increase of each climate variable as estimated by the two statistical models. The error bar indicate the sampling uncertainty based on 1000 samples generated with bootstrap resampling technique. The regression model coefficients revealed a consistently positive response of corn yield to wet conditions in states except SD and FL (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>). However, the positive effects of precipitation would be reversed after exceeding certain thresholds, demonstrating the non-linear climatic effects as accounted for in our model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Negative corn yield response to warmer growing season Tmin and Tmax is found for most states, with largest yield reduction up to 20% by 1° increase of temperature (e.g. in LA). More rapid crop development and greater water stress are among the most likely mechanisms behind the reduction of corn yields with climate warming. Nonetheless, a clear positive warming effect is also observed in some states possibly due to the fact that temperatures may not currently be above the optimum level for maximum photosynthesis rates in these regions, so that warming could enhance crop growth and yield

 </sup>. Notably, corn yield exhibits distinct and even opposite sensitivity to nighttime and daytime temperatures. For example, in IL, one degree increase of Tmin leads to 16% decrease of corn yield while Tmax could enhance the corn yield by 10%. Combined, it result in negative impacts of daily mean temperature given that Tmin has risen faster than Tmax. This findings is broadly consistent with
