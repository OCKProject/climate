<p class="p">How has change in crop spatial distribution pattern regulated corn yield response to historical climate change? Before our quantitative investigations, we first examine the performance of statistical models linking growing season precipitation (Prec), daily minimum temperature (Tmin) and daily maximum temperature (Tmax) with corn yield. TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> presents the portion of corn yield variance explained by the models in the investigated states. It is found that our models provided fairly accurate descriptions of historical corn yield variations, of which 40~70% can be explained by the considered climate factors at the state level. Averaged over the states, more than 60% of corn yield variance can be explained by the three climate variables. Note this does not preclude the role of other factors, but simply says that the majority of corn yield variation is driven by changes in the considered climate variables. Importantly, the portion of variance explained by the model fed with information of crop growing pattern changes is in general higher than that with fixed pattern except for MS, LA and OK. The low ability of statistical model to explain crop yield variance in MS, LA, and OK could be attributed to the fact that we only consider temperature and precipitation and their growing averages, without explicitly accounting for other factors such as extreme weathers and agricultural managements, which could largely influence crop yields (See Discussions section for details).
