<p class="p">Previous empirical studies are based on the assumption that crop spatial distribution pattern is constant. How would this assumption add up to the uncertainty in projecting future climate impacts on crop yields? Here, climate change uncertainties are considered by utilizing 97 climate projections under four emission scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). With global warming, growing season temperature is projected to increase for all investigated states while precipitation changes are more uncertain across the models and emission scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the projected corn yield changes by 2050 s (i.e. 2021–2050) based on the two crop models. Decrease of corn yields are found for almost all investigated corn growing states due to overwhelming effects of projected increase of Tmin and Tmax, suggesting that the majority of impacts will be driven by trends in temperature rather than precipitation. The smallest decrease is projected under RCP2.6 scenario, demonstrating the benefit of mitigations on reducing the negative climate impacts on corn yields. At the state level, the largest decrease is found in LA, which would lost all its crop yield under RCP8.5 scenario without adaptions. For those highly productive states, corn yield reduction by 20%~50% is projected depending on emission scenarios, which is in line with previous estimates

 </sup>. To physically explain the difference in the estimates between the two crop models for all investigated states is not easy as it depends on the tradeoff among the considered climatic factors, the nonlinearity and etc. Importantly, based on the model trained with corn spatial distribution pattern changes, corn yield is projected to reduce by 10%~40%, which is about 10% less than that assuming fixed pattern. The results imply that previous empirical studies ignoring the changes of crop spatial distribution pattern would have overestimated the adverse climate impacts on corn yields. Further, the difference of estimated climate impacts by considering corn spatial distribution pattern changes is comparable to climate model spread, thereby introducing another important uncertainty source.
