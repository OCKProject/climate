<p class="p">Here, we provide a data-driven analysis to investigate the role of changes in crop spatial distribution pattern between counties in regulating corn yield response to climate change at the state level over Contiguous United States (CONUS). By comparing the estimates of climate impacts on crop yield with and without accounting for crop spatial distribution pattern changes, uncertainties by assuming constant crop spatial distribution pattern as in previous empirical studies can be explored. This also helps understanding the increasing debates on whether warming will be a net gain or loss for agriculture regions like that of CNOUS by strengthening our understanding on this least understood uncertainty source. Specifically, we will address the following two scientific questions: (1) how changes in crop spatial distribution pattern have regulated the response of crop yield to historical climate change over CONUS? and (2) How much uncertainty would be expected when projecting future climate change impacts if assuming fixed crop spatial distribution pattern? Although we focus our analyses on corn in the CONUS, which account for ca. 41% of the worldâ€™s total production, the analysis framework can be extended to other crops of interest. Our results are conducted at the state-level since county-level corn area and yield information is available over CONUS.</p>
