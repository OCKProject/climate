 </sup> since fine-scale datasets of crop area and the changes do not yet exist. However, it is likely that for some crop–region combinations this may not be valid due to shift in spatial distribution pattern made possible by advances in crop technology, competing land use and etc. Therefore, investigating the effects of crop spatial distribution pattern changes can not only help explore the implications of its adaption role in modulating historical climate impacts on yields, but also understanding the uncertainty in projecting future crop yields.
