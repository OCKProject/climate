<p class="p">Understanding the relationship between climate and crop yield helps in enhancing resilience of agricultural production systems to climate change. Towards this, numerous studies have been conducted investigating how crop yield respond to climate conditions, with emphasis on the decadal and interannual climate variability

 </sup>. Indeed, farmers tend to grow crop in lands with optimal water and nutrient storage conditions, resulting in subsequent changes in crop spatial distribution pattern. Hence, a key question arise to how historical changes in crop spatial distribution pattern have regulated crop yield response to climate change?
