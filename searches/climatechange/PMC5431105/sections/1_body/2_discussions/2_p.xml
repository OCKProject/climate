<p class="p">Certainly, the inability to establish significant relationships in some crop–state combinations imply that the methodology is not suitable in all locations. Therefore, more regionalized studies might improve the specifications of climate-crop yield relationships and may corroborate or refute the findings of this study. In this study, our models provide fairly accurate descriptions of historical corn yield variations, with more than 60% of corn yield anomalies explained for the country as a whole. The remaining variance of corn yields which cannot explained by the models suggest that the poorly understood processes such as crop infection, pollination, and dormancy may be important mechanisms through which climate conditions influences crop yields. We also emphasize that future projections are conditional on the assumption of no adaptations, and therefore are unlikely to represent the true future course of yield impacts. What’s more, we acknowledge that selection of reference year and gridded crop map are the uncertainty sources which would impact our results.</p>
