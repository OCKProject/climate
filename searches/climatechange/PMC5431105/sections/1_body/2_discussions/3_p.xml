<p class="p">Therefore, we acknowledge that estimates of climate impacts in this study should not be interpreted as representing the correct magnitude of net climate change impacts. Rather, the results are intended to provide a measure of the sensitivity of climate impacts on crop yields to changes in crop spatial distribution pattern, which has received little attentions. Understanding the potential impacts in the absence of crop spatial distribution pattern is a critical step towards planning and prioritizing effective adaptation options. Moreover, our analysis is restricted to the state level as we only consider the transient crop spatial distribution pattern changes between counties within a specific state. That is, corn growing location within a specific county remain constant inheriting from the fixed gridded corn area map. Thus, we emphasize the need to develop finer scale crop area datasets for constraining the estimations in the future.</p>
