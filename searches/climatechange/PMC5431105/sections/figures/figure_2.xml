  <p class="p">Sensitivity of corn yields to one unit increase of precipitation (Prec), daily minimum temperature (Tmin), and daily minimum temperature (Tmax) estimated by two crop models. The lower case T and F in the x and y labels indicate the estimates based on model with and without considering the changes in crop growing pattern, respectively. The first row is for the corn yield response to linear effects of climate change while the second row is for the non-linear climate effects. The sensitivity is defined as the percentage changes (%) of corn yield normalized by the long-term mean to each 1 mm/day increase of Prec, 1 °C increase of Tmin and Tmax, respectively. The number indicate the average sensitivity averaged over investigated states with weights based on the long-term mean growing area. The error bar denote the standard deviation among the 1000 samples constructed by boot-strap technique to show the crop model uncertainty ranges. Figure was created using software MATLAB 2015a (
