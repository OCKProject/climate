  <p class="p">Projected state-level corn yield changes (%) by 2050 s relative to 1970–1999 under four RCPs estimated by the two crop models. The lower case T and F in the x and y labels indicate the estimates by crop model with and without considering the changes in crop growing pattern, respectively. The projected corn yields are estimated based on each climate model and the ensemble median value is shown with error bar denoting one standard deviation among the climate models in each RCP. The number indicate the multi-model ensemble median changes in corn yields averaged over investigated states with weights based on the long-term mean growing area.
