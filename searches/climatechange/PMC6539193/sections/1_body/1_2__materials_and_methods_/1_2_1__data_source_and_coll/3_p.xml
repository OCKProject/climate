<p class="p">First, we wanted to establish a qualified dataset. For all variables related to soil temperature and for any given month to be included, there had to be at least 20 days of daily records for that month. This criterion reduced the number of stations to 360. For any month, if the calculated average temperature differed from the 50-year average (
