<p class="p">Correlation coefficients (SAS statistical software, liner, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) were calculated between the soil temperature variables and other climate variables, including SD, p, h, and V in order to estimate relationships between them (
 <xref rid="ijerph-16-01504-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Furthermore, we also calculated partial correlation coefficients (SAS statistical software, liner, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) between the variables and SDTR to eliminate the effects of any interaction among variables on SDTR.
