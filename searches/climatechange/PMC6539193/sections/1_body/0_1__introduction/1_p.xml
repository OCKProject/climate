<p class="p">A large proportion of the globe has experienced climate change since the 20th century. Using the global mean surface air temperature, it has been determined that the reported increases in mean daily temperatures are due, at least partially, to differential changes in the maximum and minimum temperatures [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. On most continents, the diurnal temperature range, defined as the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures, proved to be decreasing, this is due to the obvious increase in night temperatures, and less distinct or absent increases in day temperatures [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-16-01504" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Numerous changes in climatic and environmental conditions as well as local land use can affect DTR (diurnal range of air temperature) [
