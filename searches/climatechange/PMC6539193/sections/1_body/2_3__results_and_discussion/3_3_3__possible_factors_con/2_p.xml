Consequently, a decreasing SD would reduce the downward shortwave radiation during the day, thereby limiting the increases in

The magnitude of correlation coefficients follows the order of winter (0.78) &gt; autumn (0.77) &gt; spring (0.74) &gt; summer (0.61). In addition, looking at the trends in SD changes over the same time period (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01504-f006" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>), we found that the areas of decreasing SD correspond to areas where SDTR had also decreased (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-01504-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>). Based on the strong positive correlation and similar spatial patterns, we concluded that the decreases in SD were largely contributed to the decreases in SDTR.
