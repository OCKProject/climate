<p id="Par34" class="p">As was visualised from the Google Earth image (Plate 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), there were a lot of spaces within the forest ecosystem and most of those spaces were earlier covered by grassland and in the recent past (notably seen in the image of 2014 Plate 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), these areas are now covered by shrubs and woodland that had little value to pastoralist. Additional information, for example the growth of Doldol town, was extracted from Google Earth image. Doldol town was seen to expand from 7 to 14 ha between 1984 and 2014. There were other small settlements, but they were too small to be mapped at this scale. Plate
