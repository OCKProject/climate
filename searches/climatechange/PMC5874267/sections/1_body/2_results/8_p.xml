<p id="Par40" class="p">As indicated in Plate 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, the epoch of 2004 had no agricultural activity at all and the area was covered by forest (the green and dark green colour in Plate 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In this epoch, shrub land had been noticed encroaching areas which had grassland which was reducing gradually. In deep discussion in focus group, it came out that the drought of 2000 to 2001 had discouraged the few farming households in Mukogodo area and stayed without farming up to 2005. Plate 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref> shows Mukogodo land cover change 1995 to 2004 (overlays map).
