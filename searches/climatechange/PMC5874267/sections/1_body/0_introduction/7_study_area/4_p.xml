<p id="Par11" class="p">The Yaaku are associated with the Maasai of Kenya and majority speak Maa language and are referred to as the 
 <italic class="italic">Mukogodo</italic> Maasai. 
 <italic class="italic">Athii</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mwoko</italic>re are names given to the Yaaku in the traditions by highland Bantus like Kikuyu and Meru. The Maasai called these early Cushitic people by the name Dorobo. The 
 <italic class="italic">Dorobo</italic> are not one tribe but referred to various original forest-dwelling hunters-gatherers (Southern or Eastern Cushite). One connotation of 
 <italic class="italic">Dorobo</italic> is poor people who do not own cattle (Orville 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">1996</xref>). The Yaaku consider themselves Maasai and speak Maa language because they have gotten completely into Maasai culture and language. Between 1925 and 1936, they left their Cushitic language Yaaku for the Eastern Nilotic Maasai language (Yaaku dice databaseâ€”Internet). The hunters and gatherers have knowledge of the forests natural resources, its animals and its trees, the individual properties and use of thousands of plants, where to find and gather honey and how to use them in a sustainable way; this has not only sustained the hunters and gatherers themselves but has benefited their neighbours, with whom exchange networks have been established and functioned for centuries. Their neighbours are the Maasai and Samburu who are pastoralists and the Meru who are agro-pastoralists.
