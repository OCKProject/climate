<p id="Par15" class="p">Whereas land cover indicates the physical land type such as forest or open water, consequently, land use documents how people are using the land and therefore land use data documents show how much of a region is covered by forests, wetlands, agriculture, bare areas and water types. An understanding of land use/land cover change at local, regional and global scales is important in an increasingly human-dominated biosphere. The terms land cover and land use, although often used interchangeably, their actual meanings are quite distinct. Land cover refers to the surface cover on the ground, while land use refers to the purpose the land serves (Shiraz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2014</xref>). Land cover/land use has been used extensively to derive a number of biophysical variables, such as vegetation index and biomass (Shunlin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2008</xref>). Land use and land cover are important components in understanding the interactions of the human activities with the environment, and thus, it is necessary to be able to simulate changes (Kuldeep and Kamlesh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2011</xref>). Land use and land cover change have become a central component in current strategies for managing natural resources and monitoring environmental change (Kuldeep and Kamlesh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2011</xref>). The properties measured with remote sensing techniques relate to land cover, from which land use can be inferred, particularly with supplementary data or a priori knowledge (Noam 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">1999</xref>). The detection of land use/land cover change is the process of identifying differences in the state of an object or phenomenon by observing it at different times (Singh
