<p id="Par22" class="p">As well as impressive stands of Pencil Cedar and Olive, Mukogodo boasts some magnificent Crotons, 
 <italic class="italic">C. megalocarpus</italic>, tall, graceful trees that are typical of dry forest habitats, having flattish, spreading crowns and layered silvery leaves. The nectar of the creamy-white Croton flowers attracts countless bees, providing local community groups with a rich source of honey. In the northern reaches of the forest, other plants—such as giant 
 <italic class="italic">Euphorbia candelabrum</italic> trees and “blue-bark” Commiphoras, 
 <italic class="italic">C. baluensis</italic>—come into their own. Before the rains, the Dombeya, 
 <italic class="italic">D. rotundifolia</italic>, produces exquisite bunches of pale pink flowers resembling cherry blossoms.
