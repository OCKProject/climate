<p id="p0100" class="p">From a maximum daily temperature of 26 °C upwards, the residual anomalies with their CIs do not coincide with the CI of the mean of the residuals for the overall period, shown as centred on zero. It is from a maximum daily temperature of 26 °C, therefore, that heatwave-related mortality can be said to begin to rise statistically significantly. This temperature coincides with the 89th percentile of the maximum daily temperature series for the summer months (May–September) across the period considered.</p>
