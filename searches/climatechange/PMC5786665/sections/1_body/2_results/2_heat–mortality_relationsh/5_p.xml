<p id="p0110" class="p">Although using one temperature or another for the purpose of defining a hot day (i.e. one where heat-related mortality happens) in Antwerp may be of no consequence statistically speaking, from an epidemiological standpoint the effect of temperature on mortality is linked in greater measure to high maximum than to high minimum temperatures, which fundamentally give rise to discomfort and are not a direct cause of mortality (
