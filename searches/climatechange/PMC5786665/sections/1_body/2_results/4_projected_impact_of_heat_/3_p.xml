<p id="p0135" class="p">When confronted by this difficulty, it is common to assume for simplicity that both heat-related mortality threshold temperature and its corresponding impacts remain constant over time (

 <italic class="italic">is</italic> a process of acclimatization and that this translates as the fact that the cold- or heat-related threshold temperature has indeed varied across time. This can be achieved by assuming that the percentile of the series to which the threshold temperature corresponds will remain constant, and that, since temperatures are going to vary in the coming decades, the temperatures to which such percentiles correspond will also vary.
