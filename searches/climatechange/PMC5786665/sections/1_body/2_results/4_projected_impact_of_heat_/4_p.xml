<p id="p0140" class="p">In this case, both possibilities are considered to determine, on the basis of the temperature series furnished for the periods 2026–2045 and 2081–2100 under RCP8.5 in Antwerp, the future impact of and mortality attributable to heat over this time horizon. In addition, mortality will be analysed for the entire period, and its impact will be analysed by reference to different intermediate time periods. Therefore, two hypotheses are considered in this study, with the respective assumptions being:

   <p id="p0145" class="p">that the heat-related mortality threshold temperature, corresponding to a maximum daily temperature of 26 °C (89th percentile of the maximum daily temperatures for the months of May to September), is not going to vary across time, i.e. there is no heat-adaptation process; and,</p>

   <p id="p0150" class="p">that there
