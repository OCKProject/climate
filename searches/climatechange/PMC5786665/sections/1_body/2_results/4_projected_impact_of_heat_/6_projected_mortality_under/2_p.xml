<p id="p0160" class="p">With reference to the established threshold under this scenario (i.e. a maximum daily temperature of 26 °C), there would be 535 heatwave days in Antwerp during the period 2026–2045 under RCP8.5, with 26.7 hot days/year versus the current figure of 16.4 days, a 62.8% increase. Attributable mortality across this period would be 631 persons, with a mean heat-related mortality of 32 persons per year. This value is more than double that calculated for the retrospective period 2009–2013.</p>
