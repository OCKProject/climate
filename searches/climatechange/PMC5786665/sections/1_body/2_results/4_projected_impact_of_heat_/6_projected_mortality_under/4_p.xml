<p id="p0170" class="p">In turn, during the period 2081–2100 there would be 1075 days with a maximum daily temperature above 26 °C, i.e. heat-wave days, with 35.8 hot days/year. Attributable mortality across this period would be 1710 persons, with a mean heat-related mortality of 86 persons per year. This value is 6.6 times that of the period 2009–2013, i.e. 13 persons. 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> shows the results by intermediate periods of 5 years each for 2081–2100. Under this scenario, the hot days are multiplied by 3.6 in the year 2100 and attributable mortality is multiplied by 7 in relation to the reference period 2009–2013.
