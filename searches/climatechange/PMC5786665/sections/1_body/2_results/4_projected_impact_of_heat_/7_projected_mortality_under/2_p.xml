<p id="p0175" class="p">This scenario assumes that the percentile of the series to which the threshold temperature corresponds will remain constant, and that, since temperatures are going to vary in the coming decades, the temperatures to which such percentiles correspond will also vary. In this case, that percentile that remains constant throughout is the 89th percentile of the maximum daily temperatures for the months of May to September, as determined in the period 2009â€“2013. This scenario would be the most conservative from a population acclimatization standpoint, and the goal would be to ensure that the heat-related mortality threshold temperature did not exceed the temperatures established for these periods.</p>
