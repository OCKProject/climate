<p id="p0180" class="p">Except for the first period, attributable mortality remains practically the same as in the reference period 2009–2013, i.e. 67 (19–117), as seen in 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. The number of hot days per year is always the same, since the threshold temperature is based on a percentile. These results are in line with a heat-acclimatization process, the fact that there is no variation in attributable risk, and that variations are solely due to temperature, since mortality has also been kept constant in each year.
