<p id="p0055" class="p">The geographical area under study comprises the municipality of Antwerp (Belgium) for which the daily mortality series (all non-accidental causes, ICD-10 codes: A00-R99) was collected for the period 2009–2013. Initially, mortality data were collected for the 22 municipalities that can be loosely defined as the greater Antwerp area. However, for these surrounding municipalities, both separately and in aggregate, the mortality count was too low to find statistical associations. Therefore, the analysis included only temperature and health outcome data for the city (municipality) of Antwerp for the years 2009 to 2013, for which data were provided by the Flemish Agency of Public Health. In addition, the daily series of emergency admissions due to cardiorespiratory causes (ICD-10 codes: I00-I99 and J00-J99) were collected for the same period. Population data for the city of Antwerp were obtained from Statistics Belgium for the period 1986–2015. Projections for the periods 2026–2045 and 2081–2100 were based on the United Nations World Population Prospects (WPP) forecasts for Belgium (

Taking as reference the population data for the city of Antwerp in the year 2015 (516.009 inhabitants), we calculated the proportion it represented from the total national population. Thereafter, that proportion was assumed constant, whereby the population of Antwerp would behave like that of Belgium. The specific WPP scenario chosen was the “medium variant” (
