<p id="p0070" class="p">On fitting the model, we controlled for seasonalities of a five-, four- and three-monthly nature, using the sine and cosine functions with these same periodicities; and for trend and the possible autoregressive nature of the series. To consider the effect of heat stress through maximum daily temperature (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>), we created the variable 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">heat</sub> defined on the basis of the previously calculated mortality threshold temperatures. Given that the effect of heat stress on morbidity and mortality may not be immediate, the following lagged variables were calculated: 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">heat</sub> (lag 1), which takes into account the effect of the temperature on day 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> on mortality, one day later, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> + 1; 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">heat</sub> (lag 2), which takes into account the effect of the temperature on day 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> on mortality, two days later, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> + 2; and so on successively. The number of lags were selected on the basis of the literature, which establishes that the effect of heat is short-term (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">heat</sub>: lags 1–4) (
