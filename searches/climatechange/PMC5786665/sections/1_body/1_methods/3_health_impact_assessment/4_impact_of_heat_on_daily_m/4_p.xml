Particulate matter measurements of the urban background telemetric station in Borgerhout (in the centre of the Antwerp agglomeration) have been acquired from the Flemish Environmental Agency. Based on previous studies (

 <sub class="sub">10</sub> and mortality is assumed to be linear, with an effect on mortality until lag 4. The corresponding lagged variables were therefore created until this lag, as in the case of temperature. To determine the significant variables in the modelling process to be used for calculating the

 <italic class="italic">AR</italic>s, the backward stepwise procedure was used, beginning with the model that included all the explanatory variables, and gradually eliminating those which individually displayed least statistical significance, with the process being reiterated until all the variables included were significant at
