<p id="p0060" class="p">As the dependent variable, we used data on daily mortality due to natural causes in the summer months in Antwerp from 1st January 2009 to 31st December 2013. As the independent variable, we used data on the daily maximum and minimum temperatures in this city across the same period. Instead of using daily mortality data, we chose to work with mortality residuals, thereby eliminating trend and seasonalities from the mortality series, leaving anomalies in mortality to be related to temperature. The residuals were obtained by means of univariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) modelling (

The advantage of working with residuals as opposed to daily mortality is that, once modelled, residuals display neither trends nor periodicities (both of which are inherent in daily mortality), with the result that any associations found will show a genuine temperature–mortality relationship from a statistical standpoint (with significance cut-off 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). We proceeded to plot the following on a scatter plot diagram: the mean value of the mortality series residuals on the same day (vertical axis); the maximum daily temperatures at 2 °C intervals (horizontal axis), and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). When these mortality residuals are showed in a scatter plot with the maximum temperature data, the deviations detected correspond to real mortality anomalies. The temperature from which the mortality residuals increased significantly vis-à-vis the mean would thus be the threshold temperature.
