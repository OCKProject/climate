<p id="p0045" class="p">The retrospective meteorological data series is based on temperatures derived by UrbClim, an urban climate model designed to model the urban influence on large-scale meteorological conditions at a resolution of a few hundred of metres (

 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lauwaet et al., 2015</xref>). The model solves a set of simplified prognostic flow equations for the atmospheric boundary layer and contains detailed urban surface physics, taking into account the reduced vegetation and increased soil sealing in the city centre. The synoptic (large-scale) atmospheric boundary conditions are taken from the global ERA-Interim reanalysis data set of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dee et al., 2011</xref>). Local terrain and surface data are based on open-source datasets, such as the Corine land cover and the European Environment Agency soil sealing data set for Europe. The model has previously been validated with several validation campaigns, among which one has focussed on the agglomeration of Antwerp (

 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Laaidi et al., 2011</xref>). Using the UrbClim model, daily urban climate data has been composed for all summer periods (May–September) for a climate reference period (1986–2015). The model provides gridded hourly data with a 250 m resolution for the entire urban agglomeration of Antwerp, which occupies a domain of approximately 20 by 20 km. This raw output is subsequently converted to daily minimal, mean and maximal temperature values, and for each of the 22 municipalities within the agglomeration, the (spatial) mean over the municipality is computed.
