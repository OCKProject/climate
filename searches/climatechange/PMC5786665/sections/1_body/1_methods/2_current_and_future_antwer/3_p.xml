 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lauwaet et al., 2015</xref>). We have composed projected summer daily minimal, maximal and mean temperatures for two periods, one in the near (2026–2045) and one in the far future (2081–2100), by rescaling reference temperatures (1986–2015) according to the monthly temperature changes observed in an ensemble of global climate models (GCMs). For the study at hand, the temperature rescaling functions are based on the output of a set of GCMs contained in the archives of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) archive of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2013</xref>). Based on data requirements and availability, eleven GCMs have been selected, which have to form a representative set of the GCMs contained in the entire CMIP5 archive (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lauwaet et al., 2015</xref>). Due to the large computational demand of the study, only one climate scenario has been used. In its most recent assessment report (AR5), the IPCC has identified four pathways (Representative Concentration Pathways, RCPs) (
 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2013</xref>), ranging from strong (RCP2.6) to weak mitigation (RCP8.5). To provide a range for the negative effects of climate change on human health, we have focused on the RCP8.5 scenario. Although this is the IPCC-scenario with the largest warming potential, global emission trends still track along the lines of this scenario (
