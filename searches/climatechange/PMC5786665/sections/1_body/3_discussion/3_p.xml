<p id="p0195" class="p">Heatwave definition temperatures based on epidemiological studies, such as this one, have an important advantage over those based on an exclusively climatological method, since they consider the above population-linked factors (

Moreover, from the stance of the operational efficiency of prevention plans, a proper definition of the plan activation temperature is crucial because, if the trigger temperature yielded by the climatological method is higher than that obtained epidemiologically, plans would not be implemented while heat-related mortality may already be occurring. In contrast, if the climatological percentile is below the figure obtained, this would imply activation of the prevention plan on days on which it was not required, with the ensuing economic cost (
