<p id="p0235" class="p">Modelling the heat-acclimatization process through a rise in the heatwave threshold temperature associated to a constant percentile of future temperature series under climate change may serve to test whether the adaptive processes currently being implemented are adequate to the task in a changing climate. In the case of Antwerp, the heat-related mortality threshold temperature across the period 2041–2045 should not exceed the present temperature of 26 °C by &gt; 2 °C and for period 2096–2100 should maintain about 5 °C above the present temperature. Furthermore, it should also be borne in mind that annual mortality will gradually rise over time, resulting in an increased heat-related mortality as well.</p>
