<p id="p0215" class="p">Unfortunately, we could not perform the analysis separately for cardiovascular and respiratory hospital admissions because we only had aggregated data for both sets of causes. This could indeed explain the lack of an effect of heat on the hospital admissions in our analysis. Notwithstanding, the failure to detect an association between high temperatures and hospital admissions due to cardiorespiratory causes could also be explained by differences in the pattern of relationship between heat-related hospital admissions and mortality (

Heat-related cardiovascular diseases tend to deteriorate so rapidly that patients die before being admitted to hospital. This occurs for mortality due to circulatory causes but not for mortality due to respiratory causes, which tend to display a longer-term progression (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Alberdi et al., 1998</xref>). In our case, both the fact that circulatory- and respiratory-cause admissions were combined and that the number of daily emergency admissions due to circulatory causes is generally higher than that due to respiratory causes, may account for this lack of association.
