<p id="p0200" class="p">If the minimum rather than the maximum daily temperature is used as a heatwave-definition indicator, the threshold would be 18 °C (91st percentile). This heat threshold percentile is higher than that based on the maximum daily temperature indicator, something frequently observed (
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diaz et al., 2015</xref>). The fact that this percentile is higher than that corresponding to the maximum temperature supports the choice of maximum daily temperature as the heatwave definition indicator. The reason, aside from biological considerations (
 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Havenith, 2002</xref>), is that a lower percentile implies that the prevention plan will always be activated on days on which the epidemiological evidence suggests it would be needed. For instance, if the maximum daily temperature was chosen as a threshold indicator in the period considered, it would have been exceeded 84 times, for a total of 70 occasions if the minimum temperature was chosen. That is, during 14 days there would have been mortality attributable to heat without preventions plans activated. A cautious approach to prevention would suggest using maximum daily temperature as an indicator to define a heatwave, an approach followed in several relevant studies (
