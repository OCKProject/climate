<p id="p0190" class="p">The heat-related mortality threshold temperature, corresponding to a daily maximum of 26 °C (89th percentile of the summer months) indicates that the hot day phenomenon understood as days hot enough to cause mortality is currently relatively frequent in Antwerp, with a mean of 16.4 “hot days” per year. This hot day definition temperature is in line with the climatic characteristics to which the Antwerp population is subjected (
