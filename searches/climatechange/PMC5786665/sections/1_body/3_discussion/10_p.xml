<p id="p0230" class="p">While valid as a reference point, the no acclimatization scenario - which also assumes no adaptation - is unrealistic. As mentioned, demographic and socioeconomic factors might do, and will likely continue to influence the trend in mortality-inducing temperatures (

 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ha and Kim, 2013</xref>), while in the case of respiratory-cause mortality the effect remains practically constant (
 <xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Miron et al., 2015</xref>). This trend seems to be linked to improvements in health services, socioeconomic shifts, the provision of infrastructures for better living conditions and the acclimatisation of the population to heat (
