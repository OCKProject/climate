<p id="p0250" class="p">Heat is causing significant excess summer mortality in Antwerp, and this mortality may increase in the future in the absence of adequate prevention, including the adaptation of such prevention to a changing climate. Heat-health action plans and their activation should always be based on the best available evidence, and specifically on activation thresholds based on epidemiological data and analysis. The acclimatisation of the population should be accounted for, as should realistic projections of demographic and mortality trends. More research is needed to fulfil the local evidence gap for effective prevention against heat, particularly in mid-sized urban agglomerations.</p>
