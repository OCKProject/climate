Baccini et al. studied the relationship between daily maximum apparent temperatures and mortality in 15 European cities, finding various degrees of increase in mortality in Mediterranean cities and north-continental cities, respectively, for every 1 °C increase in maximum apparent temperature above a city-specific threshold (
