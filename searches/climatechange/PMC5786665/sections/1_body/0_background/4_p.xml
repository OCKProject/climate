 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Sartor et al., 1997</xref>), and thereafter very strong impacts have been confirmed in 2003 (

 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maes et al., 2007</xref>). In this paper, we examine retrospectively the association between temperature and mortality, and selected non-fatal outcomes, in the city of Antwerp, in Belgium, in the period 2009 to 2013. Thereafter, we estimate the changes in heat-related mortality under likely climate change and population scenarios in two future time periods (2026–2045 and 2081–2100), in the absence of adequate adaptation, and discuss policy implications in the context of current prevention and adaptation efforts in Belgium.
