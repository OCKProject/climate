<p class="p">Madagascar is among the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. The population of approximately 25 million inhabitants, is predominantly rural with high levels of poverty, and is exposed to many significant extreme weather and climate events each year. The country lacks readily available resources to adequately prepare for, respond to, and recover from the damages of such events on the health sector [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Between 1990 and 2013, the country recorded 63 major natural disasters, affecting at least 13 million people [

The drought triggered by the strong El Niño phenomenon in September 2015 created an unprecedented nutritional crisis and precarious situation in the greater south of Madagascar. Due to the prolonged and severe drought that lasted from 2015–2017, 1,144,000 people were food insure, of which 665,000 people (including 333,752 women and girls) experienced severe food insecurity, and 475,000 were moderately affected [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Damages to the health sector from natural disasters each year are significant and continue long after the event. For example, in 2008, 167 Basic Health Centers and 6 hospitals were damaged [

Infectious diseases, emerging and re-emerging diseases and non-communicable diseases remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both adults and children in Madagascar. Many of these diseases are sensitive to climate conditions [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>], and are expected to be exacerbated in the future as global temperatures rise, and extreme events such as droughts and floods become more severe and frequent. Exacerbating the effects of increased human exposure, the country’s infrastructure and urban areas, especially in coastal zones, have not been developed to cope with the effects of current and future climate events. This can result in significant impacts on livelihoods, food security, infrastructure, and other sectors related to economic development.
