 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. To identify appropriate adaptation measures, analysis of current and future trends in health and climate parameters was conducted, along with an assessment of the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of the health sector and of households in specific areas. Four climate-sensitive diseases were considered: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrheal diseases, malnutrition and malaria as they are among the top ten causes of morbidity seen in outpatient clinics in the Basic Health Centers (CSBs). Some of these diseases are also among the top ten causes of hospital mortality in Madagascar, including malnutrition, which remains among the leading causes of death in children.
