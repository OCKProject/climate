<p class="p">Exposure at the household-level was measured by estimating exposure to cyclones, floods, and droughts. Sensitivity was measured using household economic indicators, such as accessibility to health infrastructure, housing characteristics, demographic conditions, health status and access to mobile phone networks. The adaptive capacity of the health system, the communities and households was measured using the ratio of health workers to population in the study area, the ratio of population served by basic health facilities, the geographic accessibility rate, literacy rates, the non-farm business ownership rates and the average annual income. The identification of adaptation options to reduce health risks was based on expert judgment retrieved during the focus groups that were held in each target district. For the analysis of climate trends, the Mann Kendall statistical test and linear regression analysis were used to identify whether the climate trends are significant variables for the occurrence and distribution of the climate sensitive diseases of interest.</p>
