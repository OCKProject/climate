<p class="p">The main climate-related hazards affecting Madagascar are tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. On average, from November to April, three to four tropical cyclones hit Madagascar every year. Most cyclones form in the Indian Ocean, but some occasionally form in the Mozambique Channel and arrive from the west. All regions in Madagascar can be affected by tropical cyclones but the most affected are the eastern, northwestern, and western regions.</p>
