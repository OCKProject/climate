<p class="p">Droughts occur mostly in the southern regions of Madagascar which has a semi-arid climate, but it can also affect the central highlands and the eastern region. When the onset of the rainy season is delayed and the amount of precipitation is well below normal in the central highlands and eastern regions, rice production which is the staple of the local diet, is significantly affected.</p>
