<p class="p">Tropical cyclones bring torrential flooding which often lead to dam breaks, as was the case in Fiherenena in 2013 after tropical cyclone Haruna struck the southwest region. Episodes of heavy summer rainfall can also cause flooding in cities, including the urban slums of Antananarivo, due to the lack of efficient rainwater drainage systems.</p>
