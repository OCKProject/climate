<p class="p">The assessment of regional vulnerability to the health risks posed by climate change was based on secondary data and the indicators selected depended on their availability. The regionally aggregated data are representative at a regional scale, however strong differences in data quality are observed when considered at district and commune level. In addition, the data were collected over different time periods. Epidemiological data from the Ministry of Public Health is collected through routine surveillance conducted by health facilities. However, national average attendance rates for basic health facilities is low at around 40%, and varies greatly among regions and districts, suggesting that official sources may underestimate the actual prevalence and conditions of many climate sensitive diseases.</p>
