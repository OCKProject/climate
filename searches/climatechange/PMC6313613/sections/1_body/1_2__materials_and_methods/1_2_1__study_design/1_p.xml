<p class="p">The vulnerability and adaptation assessment followed the methodology proposed by World Health Organization [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. The study was conducted over ten months in 2015. A multidisciplinary study team comprised of experts in key areas such as meteorology, public health, epidemiology, malaria, malnutrition supported the project. The assessment focused on regional scale vulnerability mapping, establishing a baseline of indicators for key climate sensitive health outcomes, and projecting possible future disease trends. As a government led study, participating experts included those that are highly involved in Madagascar’s national disease control and prevention activities. This ensured that the outcomes of the study would relate directly to the health sector’s programmatic opportunities. Four analyses were conducted for the study:
