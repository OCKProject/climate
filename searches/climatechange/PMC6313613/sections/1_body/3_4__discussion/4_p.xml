<p class="p">Significant correlations of varying degrees were found between the frequency of climate-sensitive health outcomes, socio-economic determinants and climate parameters. This finding suggests important relationships exist between climate conditions and socio-economic factors of households that are important to the health status of Madagascar’s population in specific localities as well as a whole. Differences in exposure and vulnerability also result from non-climate stressors and multidimensional inequalities among the population that are often produced by unequal development processes. These differences help to determine differential health risks due to climate change. Ultimately, Madagascar’s 22 regions show different levels of vulnerability to the health risks posed by climate change. Areas with high levels of exposure and low adaptive capacity are among the most vulnerable, as is the case in Farafangana. Poverty and low literacy rates appear to be influencing factors for all health outcomes of interest studied within this assessment.</p>
