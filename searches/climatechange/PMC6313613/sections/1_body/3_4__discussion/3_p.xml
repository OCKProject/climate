 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f004" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>a) show an increasing observed trend from 2000â€“2014 and both are also expected to increase in the future as the climate continues to change. ARIs, with a morbidity rate of 30%, are by far the leading reason for visits to basic health facilities in Madagascar. In addition to climate factors, the poor quality of ambient air (due to industrial pollution, deforestation, burning of waste and indoor air pollution from biomass burning for cooking and heating), poor nutritional status are all risk factors for the occurrence of ARIs. Further studies are required to determine the reasons behind the continued increase in the prevalence of ARIs in Madagascar and to identify which risk factors are most significant.
