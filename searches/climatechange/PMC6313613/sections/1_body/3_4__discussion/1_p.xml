 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f003" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>a) may be explained by high levels of investment in malaria control and in food and nutritional security over the study period. Nevertheless, the assessment suggests projected increases in the prevalence of these two health outcomes in the future due to the impacts of climate change (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f005" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). For example, it is well known that decreases in rainfall reduces the availability of surface and ground water and can lead to reduced agricultural production, animal survival and nutrition among the population, ultimately leading to poorer health. In Madagascar, the negative impacts of drought on crop yields and subsequently on the nutritional status of the population have been observed frequently in the past. These events have resulted in the loss of life and livelihoods and have also undermined development investments in economic and nutritional security within the region.
