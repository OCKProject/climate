<p class="p">For malaria, the projected increase in cases can be explained by the expected expansion of the mosquito vector’s habitat range to areas where it does not currently exist. This aligns with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report which reported a change in the geographical distribution of some vector-borne diseases [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Multiple microclimates (tropical hot and humid, semi-humid, semi-arid), the expected increased variability of precipitation and the continuous increases in temperature can modify the number and the quality of mosquito vectors’ larval deposits, as well as vegetation density, and influence the resting spots for mosquitos. A high density of vectors, combined with decreasing rates of immunity due to previous control interventions, or a possible reduction in the effectiveness of future control measures, could trigger disease outbreaks and expand transmission. If the most significant effects of climate change on disease transmission are likely to occur at the extremes of the temperature range by favoring the transmission of many diseases, (generally 14–18 °C for the lowest temperatures and 35–40 °C for the highest temperatures [

These findings are supported by a study commissioned by the WHO showing that the risk of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue, are expected to increase in Madagascar towards 2070 [
