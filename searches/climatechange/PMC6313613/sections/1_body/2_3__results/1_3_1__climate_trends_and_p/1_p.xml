<p class="p">For the analysis of temperature trends, minimum temperatures in the winter season (June—July—August) and maximum temperatures in the summer season (December—January—February) were considered since these climate extremes influence the transmission mode of climate sensitive diseases. Early summer (October—November), core summer (December—January—February) and late summer (March—April) seasonal precipitation rates were analyzed as they determine the starting and ending dates of many disease epidemics such as plague and malaria.</p>
