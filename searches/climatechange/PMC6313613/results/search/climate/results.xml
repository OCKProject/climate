 <result pre="However, due to evidence of the link between some diseases," exact="climate" post="and socioeconomic factors—and higher levels of vulnerability to the"/>

 <result pre="regions, the following adaptation measures should be implemented: (1) Integrate" exact="climate" post="risk management into health system activities, particularly in program"/>
