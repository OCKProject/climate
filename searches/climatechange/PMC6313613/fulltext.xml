In this study, the vulnerability of Madagascar&#x02019;s health sector to climate change was assessed and appropriate adaptation measures were identified. In order to assess climate risks, vulnerability and identify adaptation options, the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health as well as the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service worked in close collaboration with a team of local experts to conduct a literature review, field surveys, and analyses of current and future climate and health trends. Four climate-sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, malnutrition, and malaria. Baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence; while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period. To assess future impacts in Madagascar, this baseline information was used with climate projections for the two scenarios&#x02014;RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5&#x02014;for the periods 2016&#x02013;2035, 2036&#x02013;2070 and 2071&#x02013;2100. Future climate conditions are shown to exacerbate and increase the incidence of all four climate sensitive diseases. Further analysis of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the climate hazards suggests that the health sector in four regions of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable. The study recommends adaptation measures to improve the monitoring and early warning systems for climate sensitive diseases, as well as to reduce population vulnerability.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Madagascar</kwd><kwd>assessment</kwd><kwd>health</kwd><kwd>climate trends</kwd><kwd>climate projections</kwd><kwd>climate-sensitive diseases</kwd><kwd>vulnerability</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-ijerph-15-02643"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Madagascar is among the most vulnerable countries to the adverse effects of climate change. The population of approximately 25 million inhabitants, is predominantly rural with high levels of poverty, and is exposed to many significant extreme weather and climate events each year. The country lacks readily available resources to adequately prepare for, respond to, and recover from the damages of such events on the health sector [<xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Between 1990 and 2013, the country recorded 63 major natural disasters, affecting at least 13 million people [<xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The drought triggered by the strong El Ni&#x000f1;o phenomenon in September 2015 created an unprecedented nutritional crisis and precarious situation in the greater south of Madagascar. Due to the prolonged and severe drought that lasted from 2015&#x02013;2017, 1,144,000 people were food insure, of which 665,000 people (including 333,752 women and girls) experienced severe food insecurity, and 475,000 were moderately affected [<xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Damages to the health sector from natural disasters each year are significant and continue long after the event. For example, in 2008, 167 Basic Health Centers and 6 hospitals were damaged [<xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Infectious diseases, emerging and re-emerging diseases and non-communicable diseases remain the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in both adults and children in Madagascar. Many of these diseases are sensitive to climate conditions [<xref rid="B5-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and are expected to be exacerbated in the future as global temperatures rise, and extreme events such as droughts and floods become more severe and frequent. Exacerbating the effects of increased human exposure, the country&#x02019;s infrastructure and urban areas, especially in coastal zones, have not been developed to cope with the effects of current and future climate events. This can result in significant impacts on livelihoods, food security, infrastructure, and other sectors related to economic development.</p><p>This study was conducted by the Government of Madagascar to assess the risks, vulnerability and identify adaptation options to improve the health sector&#x02019;s preparedness for the impacts of climate change [<xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. To identify appropriate adaptation measures, analysis of current and future trends in health and climate parameters was conducted, along with an assessment of the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of the health sector and of households in specific areas. Four climate-sensitive diseases were considered: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrheal diseases, malnutrition and malaria as they are among the top ten causes of morbidity seen in outpatient clinics in the Basic Health Centers (CSBs). Some of these diseases are also among the top ten causes of hospital mortality in Madagascar, including malnutrition, which remains among the leading causes of death in children.</p><p>Monthly health data from January 2000 to December 2014 was analyzed along with climate data from 1981 to 2014. Climate projections were derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparaison Project version 5 (CMIP5) products.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-ijerph-15-02643"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-ijerph-15-02643"><title>2.1. Study Design</title><p>The vulnerability and adaptation assessment followed the methodology proposed by World Health Organization [<xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The study was conducted over ten months in 2015. A multidisciplinary study team comprised of experts in key areas such as meteorology, public health, epidemiology, malaria, malnutrition supported the project. The assessment focused on regional scale vulnerability mapping, establishing a baseline of indicators for key climate sensitive health outcomes, and projecting possible future disease trends. As a government led study, participating experts included those that are highly involved in Madagascar&#x02019;s national disease control and prevention activities. This ensured that the outcomes of the study would relate directly to the health sector&#x02019;s programmatic opportunities.

Madagascar Climate</title><p>Madagascar is an island located 400 km from the southeast African coast. With an area of 587,041 km&#x000b2;, Madagascar is the fourth largest island in the world. The geographical location, highly varied topography, maritime influence, and wind regimes explain the variety of climate and ecological regions on the island. Madagascar experiences two main seasons: a dry season from May to October, and a rainy season from November to April. Broadly, Madagascar is divided into five climate regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>-</label><p>The eastern coast has a warm and humid tropical climate;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>The central highland has a high altitude tropical climate;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>The western region has a warm climate and two distinct seasons, a dry winter and a hot and humid summer;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>The north and northwest region has a tropical climate, with the northwest monsoon conditions driving rainfall during the summer season;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>The southern region of the country has a semi-arid climate.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The main climate-related hazards affecting Madagascar are tropical cyclones, floods and droughts. On average, from November to April, three to four tropical cyclones hit Madagascar every year. Most cyclones form in the Indian Ocean, but some occasionally form in the Mozambique Channel and arrive from the west. All regions in Madagascar can be affected by tropical cyclones but the most affected are the eastern, northwestern, and western regions.</p><p>Tropical cyclones bring torrential flooding which often lead to dam breaks, as was the case in Fiherenena in 2013 after tropical cyclone Haruna struck the southwest region. Episodes of heavy summer rainfall can also cause flooding in cities, including the urban slums of Antananarivo, due to the lack of efficient rainwater drainage systems.</p><p>Droughts occur mostly in the southern regions of Madagascar which has a semi-arid climate, but it can also affect the central highlands and the eastern region. When the onset of the rainy season is delayed and the amount of precipitation is well below normal in the central highlands and eastern regions, rice production which is the staple of the local diet, is significantly affected.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-ijerph-15-02643"><title>2.3. Climate Hazards and Health Outcomes</title><p>The climate hazards used in the assessment were chosen according to three criteria:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>-</label><p>affecting Madagascar;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>generating significant negative socio-economic impacts, particularly on health;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>could be aggravated by climate change.</p></list-item></list></p><p>According to these criteria, three climate hazards&#x02014;tropical cyclones, floods and drought&#x02014;were selected for assessment within the exposure component of the vulnerability study. The health outcomes of interest are malnutrition, ARI, diarrhea, and malaria. They each: (i) have established associations with climate parameters, (ii) constitute a public health problem in Madagascar, (iii) exhibit morbidity rates that can be reduced by preventive interventions, and (iv) have data of sufficient quality to conduct longitudinal analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-ijerph-15-02643"><title>2.4.

Sensitivity was measured using household economic indicators, such as accessibility to health infrastructure, housing characteristics, demographic conditions, health status and access to mobile phone networks. The adaptive capacity of the health system, the communities and households was measured using the ratio of health workers to population in the study area, the ratio of population served by basic health facilities, the geographic accessibility rate, literacy rates, the non-farm business ownership rates and the average annual income. The identification of adaptation options to reduce health risks was based on expert judgment retrieved during the focus groups that were held in each target district. For the analysis of climate trends, the Mann Kendall statistical test and linear regression analysis were used to identify whether the climate trends are significant variables for the occurrence and distribution of the climate sensitive diseases of interest.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot7-ijerph-15-02643"><title>2.7. Limits of the Study</title><p>The assessment of regional vulnerability to the health risks posed by climate change was based on secondary data and the indicators selected depended on their availability. The regionally aggregated data are representative at a regional scale, however strong differences in data quality are observed when considered at district and commune level. In addition, the data were collected over different time periods. Epidemiological data from the Ministry of Public Health is collected through routine surveillance conducted by health facilities. However, national average attendance rates for basic health facilities is low at around 40%, and varies greatly among regions and districts, suggesting that official sources may underestimate the actual prevalence and conditions of many climate sensitive diseases.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3-ijerph-15-02643"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>The decreasing trend in the prevalence of malaria in Morondava (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f003">Figure 3</xref>b) and of malnutrition in the city of Antananarivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f003">Figure 3</xref>a) may be explained by high levels of investment in malaria control and in food and nutritional security over the study period. Nevertheless, the assessment suggests projected increases in the prevalence of these two health outcomes in the future due to the impacts of climate change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f005">Figure 5</xref>). For example, it is well known that decreases in rainfall reduces the availability of surface and ground water and can lead to reduced agricultural production, animal survival and nutrition among the population, ultimately leading to poorer health. In Madagascar, the negative impacts of drought on crop yields and subsequently on the nutritional status of the population have been observed frequently in the past. These events have resulted in the loss of life and livelihoods and have also undermined development investments in economic and nutritional security within the region.</p><p>For malaria, the projected increase in cases can be explained by the expected expansion of the mosquito vector&#x02019;s habitat range to areas where it does not currently exist. This aligns with the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report which reported a change in the geographical distribution of some vector-borne diseases [<xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Multiple microclimates (tropical hot and humid, semi-humid, semi-arid), the expected increased variability of precipitation and the continuous increases in temperature can modify the number and the quality of mosquito vectors&#x02019; larval deposits, as well as vegetation density, and influence the resting spots for mosquitos. A high density of vectors, combined with decreasing rates of immunity due to previous control interventions, or a possible reduction in the effectiveness of future control measures, could trigger disease outbreaks and expand transmission. If the most significant effects of climate change on disease transmission are likely to occur at the extremes of the temperature range by favoring the transmission of many diseases, (generally 14&#x02013;18 &#x000b0;C for the lowest temperatures and 35&#x02013;40 &#x000b0;C for the highest temperatures [<xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]), the projected increase in the average annual temperature of Madagascar (currently between 14 &#x000b0;C and 27.5 &#x000b0;C depending on region) will result in many areas becoming more favorable to the transmission of climate-sensitive vector-borne diseases, including malaria, as well as dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever. These findings are supported by a study commissioned by the WHO showing that the risk of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue, are expected to increase in Madagascar towards 2070 [<xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02643" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>In addition, ARIs in Farafangana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f004">Figure 4</xref>b) and diarrheal diseases in Antsiranana (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-15-02643-f004">Figure 4</xref>a) show an increasing observed trend from 2000&#x02013;2014 and both are also expected to increase in the future as the climate continues to change. ARIs, with a morbidity rate of 30%, are by far the leading reason for visits to basic health facilities in Madagascar. In addition to climate factors, the poor quality of ambient air (due to industrial pollution, deforestation, burning of waste and indoor air pollution from biomass burning for cooking and heating), poor nutritional status are all risk factors for the occurrence of ARIs. Further studies are required to determine the reasons behind the continued increase in the prevalence of ARIs in Madagascar and to identify which risk factors are most significant.</p><p>Significant correlations of varying degrees were found between the frequency of climate-sensitive health outcomes, socio-economic determinants and climate parameters. This finding suggests important relationships exist between climate conditions and socio-economic factors of households that are important to the health status of Madagascar&#x02019;s population in specific localities as well as a whole. Differences in exposure and vulnerability also result from non-climate stressors and multidimensional inequalities among the population that are often produced by unequal development processes. These differences help to determine differential health risks due to climate change. Ultimately, Madagascar&#x02019;s 22 regions show different levels of vulnerability to the health risks posed by climate change. Areas with high levels of exposure and low adaptive capacity are among the most vulnerable, as is the case in Farafangana. Poverty and low literacy rates appear to be influencing factors for all health outcomes of interest studied within this assessment.</p><p>To better understand and guide decision-making processes that support planning, monitoring, preparedness, and implementation of control measures through adaptation, further analyses and modeling of these health risks with climate change scenarios is needed while also considering Madagascar&#x02019;s the diverse geography, climate zones, and socio-economic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-ijerph-15-02643"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The findings of this assessment will serve to enhance knowledge on the link between climate change and diseases of concern in Madagascar and will inform actions taken by the health sector to protect the population from the health risks of climate change.</p><p>This study revealed two striking results:<list list-type="simple"><list-item><label>-</label><p>The population of Madagascar and the health sector are already very vulnerable to the risks of current climate variability as evidenced by observations of current health impacts;</p></list-item><list-item><label>-</label><p>Climate change is expected to increase risks to health and well-being in the future.</p></list-item></list></p><p>Strengthening the adaptive capacity of the population and of the health sector is an urgent need and actions should be taken to empower the population, especially in more vulnerable areas, to adopt needed protective measures.</p><p>Continuous collaboration between the health and meteorological sectors is essential. The health sector should use current and projected climate data to inform the development of a climate and health early warning system.</p><p>The reduction of vulnerability at the household-level also represents an important adaptation measure to reduce negative health impacts from climate change. It is therefore essential to implement a rigorous system and a national action plan to guide appropriate and effective household adaptation actions and increase Madagascar&#x02019;s resilience to climate change.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank (1) The World Health Organization (Madagascar Office, AFRO, Geneva); (2) The World Meteorological Organization/Global Framework for Climate Services; (3) The GIZ and (4) Christopher Golden, Harvard School of Public Health, Wildlife Conservation Society, HEAL (Health &#x00026; Ecosystems: Analysis of Linkages).</p></ack><app-group><app id="app1-ijerph-15-02643"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/12/2643/s1">http://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/15/12/2643/s1</uri>, Table S1: Correlation between diarrhea and climate and socioeconomical parameters, Table S2: Correlation between malnutrition and climate and socioeconomical parameters, Table S3: Correlation between malaria and climate and socioeconomical parameters, Table S4: Correlation between ARI and climate and socioeconomical parameters, Table S5: Matrix of the exposure assessment, Table S6: Matrix of sensitivity assessment, Table S7: Matrix of adaptive capacity assessment, Table S8: Matrix of the regions&#x02019; vulnerability assessment.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ijerph-15-02643-s001"><media xlink:href="ijerph-15-02643-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></app></app-group><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, N.R.
