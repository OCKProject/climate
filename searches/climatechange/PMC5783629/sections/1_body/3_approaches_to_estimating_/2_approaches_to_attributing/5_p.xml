<p class="p">Two recent efforts took different approaches to heat-related D&amp;A, not based on event attribution. A study in Stockholm, Sweden estimated the extent to which mortality due to temperature extremes during the period 1980–2009 could be attributed to climate change based on 1900–1929 baseline temperatures (

 </inline-formula>). The increase in daily mean temperatures suggested the increased number of heatwaves were due to climate change. The study concluded that mortality from heat extremes was double what would have occurred without climate change, adjusting for urbanization and the urban heat island effect.
