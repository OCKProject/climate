<p class="p">The observed increase in cases of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> infections in the Baltic Sea can be attributed to an increase in SST, which in turn can be attributed to global climate change. SST projections into the future indicate that an enlargement of coastal areas that can sustain large 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> populations also translates into an elevated risk of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> infections in this region.
