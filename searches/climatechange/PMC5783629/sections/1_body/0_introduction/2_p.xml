<p class="p">There have been limited efforts to understand the extent to which changes in the current burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes could be formally attributed to climate change (
 <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cramer et al. 2014</xref>). Nevertheless there is strong evidence now that changing weather patterns associated with climate change are shifting the geographic range, seasonality, and intensity of transmission of selected climate-sensitive infectious diseases (
 <xref rid="c53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenza and Menne 2009</xref>), and increasing morbidity and mortality associated with extreme weather and climate events (
 <xref rid="c56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Smith et al. 2014</xref>). We now have a much better understanding of the character, timing, and spatial pattern of climate change due to research undertaken over the past several decades (
 <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC 2013</xref>). Together with demonstrable changes in disease incidence and/or mortality, this means it is now possible, in a few instances, to attribute a portion of current burdens of specific climate-sensitive health outcomes to climate change. Building the evidence-base on detection and attribution (D&amp;A) is the basis for better evidence-based risk management to reduce current and plan for future climate change-related health burdens, and to inform advocacy for actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.
