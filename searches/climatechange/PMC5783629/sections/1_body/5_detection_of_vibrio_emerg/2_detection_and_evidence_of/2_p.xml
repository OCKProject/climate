<p class="p">Based on a review of the peer-reviewed literature, gray literature, and microbiology laboratories in the Baltic Sea region, 283 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> cases were identified in the Baltic Sea region and the Eastern North Sea area between 1977 and 2010 (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baker-Austin et al. 2013</xref>). Of these, 272 cases (96%) were from the Baltic Sea area, and most cases reported were 
 <italic class="italic">V. vulnificus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholerae</italic> (non-O1/O139) wound infections. The vast majority of cases were reported from 1997 onward (234 cases, 85%). The number of cases over this period increased in correlation with temperature increases, with periods of reported infections in close association with the areas of maximum warming. For example, during the summers of 1994, 2003, 2006, and 2010, significant and sustained warm water anomalies were evident across much of the Baltic Sea area and these years corresponded with increases in reported 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic>-associated illness. The relationship between the annual number of human cases of vibriosis and mean summer SST was examined using a generalized linear model. It showed a highly significant association between a mean summer temperature increase and the number of reported human cases of vibriosis: For every increase in the maximum annual SST, the number of observed cases increased 1.93 times (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baker-Austin et al. 2013</xref>). Thus, 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> cases can be attributed to SST increase. When plotted, the number of cases occurring each year was highly aggregated, with only a few cases observed in the majority of years, and only a few years (2003, 2006, and 2010) with an exceptional number of cases.
