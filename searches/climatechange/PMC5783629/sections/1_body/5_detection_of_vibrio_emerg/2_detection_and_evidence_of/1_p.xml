 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> bacteria can be analyzed by examining zooplankton from a Continuous Plankton Recorder, an instrument that, when tugged behind ocean vessels, filters plankton over vast areas of ocean. 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> bacteria attach to such plankton samples and can be tracked over time and space. Over the past six decades, the concentrations of these different 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> species have increased along with increasing SST (

 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> abundance, but also with 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> cases in humans along the coast of the North Atlantic and North Sea. Based on generalized additive models, the SST warming trend is responsible for the long-term increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> concentration in this large oceanic area, as well as the unprecedented increase in 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> cases in humans reported from Northern Europe and along the U.S. Atlantic coast (
