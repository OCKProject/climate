 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> species, besides 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholera</italic>, became nationally notifiable in January 2007. A total of 1,252 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> infections (excluding toxigenic 
 <italic class="italic">V. cholerae</italic> O1 and O139) were reported to CDC in 2014, of which 326 (27%) resulted in hospitalizations, and 34 (4%) in death (

 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> was responsible for almost half of all cases but only 1% of deaths, and 
 <italic class="italic">V. vulnificus</italic> was isolated from 10% of the patients, 18% of whom died. Of all these 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> cases, a third was reported from Pacific Coast states, a quarter from Gulf Coast states, a quarter from Atlantic Coast states and the remaining from noncoastal states. Of the domestically acquired vibriosis cases, a third (402) were non-foodborne (confirmed or probable); of these 79% reported having skin exposure to a body of water within 7 d before illness began, 17% reported contact with marine wildlife, and 17% reported handling seafood (
