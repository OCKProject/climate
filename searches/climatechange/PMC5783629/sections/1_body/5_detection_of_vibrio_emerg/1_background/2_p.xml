 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic>. Although wound infections with 
 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> also occur, they are less frequent than seafood-borne infections. In fact, 
 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> outbreaks tend to be clustered along coastal areas in late summer and early fall when SSTs surpassed the threshold of 15Â°C that favors bacterial replication (
 <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Semenza et al. 2012a</xref>). Besides oysters and clams, other seafood associated with these outbreaks includes shrimp, crab, squid, mackerel, tuna, and sardines. Recreational water use in areas with high bacterial load or working in affected areas can also result in infections of the eyes, ears, or open cuts and wounds. Subsequent to Hurricane Katrina, 22 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> wound infections were reported, 3 caused by 
 <italic class="italic">V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and 2 of which were fatal.
