<p class="p">Based on the expected warming of the Baltic Sea under climate change scenarios the risk of 
 <italic class="italic">Vibrio</italic> infection can be projected into the future (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baker-Austin et al. 2013</xref>). Based on the risk model constructed for the summer 2006, projections of temperature were applied to estimate the risk of infection for 2050. Based on these models, areas in the Baltic with an elevated risk are projected to enlarge; moreover, the risk of infection is projected to expand farther north and engulf coastal areas with high population densities in the middle and southern part of the Baltic Sea.
