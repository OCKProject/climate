<p class="p">The first studies to detect a significant expansion of the range of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> were conducted in 2007 and 2008 (

 <xref rid="c31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogden et al. 2010</xref>) and found low abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> at a number of sites in southern Quebec and low prevalence of 
 <italic class="italic">B. burgdorferi</italic> in ticks at some of these sites. The spatial pattern of these tick-positive sites at a subprovincial scale was strongly and statistically significantly associated with the predicted numbers for the site based on the site temperature conditions obtained using a simulation model of the tick populations. This analysis accounted for other possible drivers for the emergence of the tick populations including estimated numbers of immigrating ticks, tick host abundance, and clustering/spatial autocorrelation issues. Other studies using the same sites or sampling sites in the region found consistent positive associations between the presence and abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> ticks on animal hosts (rodents and deer) and temperature, accounting for a range of alternative potential drivers for tick occurrence including habitat, rodent host abundance, rodent host species diversity, animal-level variables (e.g., age, sex, reproductive status), deer density, rainfall, and the possibility of spatial autocorrelation (
