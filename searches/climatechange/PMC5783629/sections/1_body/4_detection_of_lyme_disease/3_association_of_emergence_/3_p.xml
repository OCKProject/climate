<p class="p">Even so, it could be argued that warming in southern Canada and emergence of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> tick populations was just coincidence, and that the process of northward spread of 
 <italic class="italic">I. scapularis</italic> tick populations was simply a matter of the tick continuing to more completely fill its ecological niche in North America. However, Leighton et al. provided empirical evidence that during the period of warming, locations acquired tick populations faster the warmer they were, over and above other possible determinants of tick population establishment (dispersal, spatial spread from neighboring locations, habitat, etc.) (
