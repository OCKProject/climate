<p class="p">D&amp;A studies have a long history in climate science in quantifying the extent to which climate change has changed the mean and variability of weather variables (
 <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hegerl and Zwiers 2011</xref>). The main approaches to D&amp;A can be categorized into single-step and multi-step studies (Stone et al. 2013).

    <bold class="bold">Single-step attribution</bold> uses a single comprehensive statistical model that detects a significant change in the variable of interest and compares the observed change with that expected if climate change had not occurred. This approach is typically used for weather data; for example, temperature and heat-related mortality.

    <bold class="bold">Multi-step attribution</bold> links separate single-step approaches that 
    <italic class="italic">a</italic>) attribute an observed change in a variable of interest to a change in climate or other environmental variable, and 
    <italic class="italic">b</italic>) attribute the change in climate to external drivers (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions). For example, the first step links temperature increases to heat-related mortality. The second step links the temperature increase to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The assessment of the relationships between climate and the variable of interest may involve a process model or statistical association. This approach has been used for D&amp;A in ecosystem studies (
