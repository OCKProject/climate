<p class="p">D&amp;A studies determine 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) “whether a system is changing beyond a specified baseline that characterizes behavior in the absence of climate change”; and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) “whether climate change has contributed substantially to the observed change in a system” (Stone et al. 2013). Because climate is always changing, and because there are many factors that can influence whether an aspect of a health or other system changed over time, with these factors also changing over time, studies establish baselines or reference periods against which change is measured. D&amp;A analyses of impacts ideally isolate the system of interest, such as the constellation of influences on Lyme disease, and then determine whether the observed behavior in the system changes when other factors than climate are removed or held constant to the extent possible. Attribution studies typically focus on whether and to what extent a system has changed in response to observed climate change (
