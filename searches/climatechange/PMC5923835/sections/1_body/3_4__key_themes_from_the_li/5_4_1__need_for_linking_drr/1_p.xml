<p class="p">The push for greater health involvement in DRR and CCA is highlighted in both areas of global policy and research literature [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. The need for linking DRR and CCA in health will increase as the role of health in DRR and CCA continues to grow. As the Sendai Framework has broadened the definition of hazards to include epidemics and pandemics as part of an all-hazard approach to DRR [

 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], climate-sensitive diseases emerge as a potential area for overlap between DRR and CCA in health. Furthermore, some categories of climate change impacts, such as heatwaves, are not often classified as hazards associated with disasters within climate change discourse [

 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. These potential areas for additional overlap between DRR and CCA in health have not previously been considered in the literature [
 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. These overlaps have the potential to increase as DRR continues to move toward an approach which aims to address underlying risks, just as CCA seeks to address underlying vulnerabilities.
