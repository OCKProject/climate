<p class="p">This review takes a narrative approach in the presentation of the findings. Literature was primarily sourced from Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Google Scholar using ‘disaster risk reduction’, ‘climate change adaptation’ and ‘health’ as search terms. Literature considered relevant to this review needed to explicitly refer to building integration, links, synergies or coherence between DRR, CCA and health in the body of the text (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-15-00793-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The review also draws on integration literature not specific to health where relevant.
