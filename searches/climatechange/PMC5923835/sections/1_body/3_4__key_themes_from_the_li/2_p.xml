<p class="p">The knowledge around why and how to build links between DRR and CCA is growing conceptually, and at international and national policy levels. However, the development of links between DRR and CCA is still in its infancy [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Further exploration into how these links are developed in different contexts at various scales is needed, particularly in health. While there has been some discussion on theoretical ways in which DRR and CCA can be linked in health, this knowledge base is scattered and thin. To build a coherent foundation for driving links in health this review summarises the current state of knowledge.
