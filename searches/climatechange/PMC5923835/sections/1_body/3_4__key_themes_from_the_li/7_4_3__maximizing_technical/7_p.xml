<p class="p">EWS are an important aspect of the resilience of health systems and populations. Both DRR and CCA in health promote EWS as essential tools for preparing for disasters and preventing poor health outcomes from hazards and climate-sensitive diseases [

 <xref rid="B133-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">133</xref>]. These efforts have been strengthened by the objectives of the HFA [

Recently, a UNFCCC report on adaptation in health highlighted the need to increase risk communication to the public, and early response for climate change, particularly the “need for more guidance to be provided to the public on how to act in the event of climate change impacts such as heatwaves and storms” [
 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] (p. 18). EWS, public communication strategies, and preparedness for heatwaves are areas that DRR actors in health have existing experience, tools and technical knowledge [

 <xref rid="B87-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">87</xref>]. It is important to draw together DRR and CCA approaches in these areas to ensure they are informed by the most recent climate change science, and early warning and risk communication expertise. Doing so will also be essential to avoid creating unnecessary technical and operational duplication. However, there is no literature relating to how the seemingly separate initiatives do, or will, link together to draw on potential synergies.
