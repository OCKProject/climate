 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Uncertainty and a lack of comprehensive climate change data, as well as little research of climate change on health systems, present significant challenges to joint assessments [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. As such, a greater understanding is needed on how to conduct joint risk assessments in the context of uncertainty of climate change data, and health and health system impacts. The consideration of health impact pathways is a potential starting point for building technical and operational synergy to address commonalities in health risks of climate change and climate-sensitive disasters [
