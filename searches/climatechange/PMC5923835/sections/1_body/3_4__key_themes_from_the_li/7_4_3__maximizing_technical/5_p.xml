<p class="p">Health systems strengthening has been suggested as an important no-regrets strategy for linking DRR and CCA in health [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Health systems strengthening has become an important approach in DRR, particularly since the Ebola outbreak, which forced health practitioners and researchers to examine how resilient health systems are in the face of growing global challenges [

 <xref rid="B121-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">121</xref>]. Similarly, the health systems approach has been picked up in CCA and health literature and technical guidance, such as the aforementioned H-NAPs [

 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. If health systems strengthening is going to be developed as a sustainable long-term solution to disaster and climate change risks in health, joint action will be needed in identifying risks and priorities for the health system. This may include the use of key climate change and health data in health planning to prevent slow-onset health disasters from emerging due to changing pressures on health systems. For example, having an understanding of climate change-related migration can improve the ability of health facilities to accommodate population surges in areas as a result of climate related-disasters and thus improve the resilience of the health system [
 <xref rid="B110-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]. However, there is little health systems strengthening research that maximizes technical and operational synergies by drawing on both DRR and CCA literature and approaches outside of strengthening health infrastructure.
