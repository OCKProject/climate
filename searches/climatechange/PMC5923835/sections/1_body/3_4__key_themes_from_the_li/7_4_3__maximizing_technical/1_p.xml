<p class="p">Linking DRR and CCA is important to build on existing methods and resources in DRR and CCA in order to maximize technical and operational synergies. Technical and operational synergies are those areas of work which offer potential for joint strategies to reduce duplication and strengthen tools, expertise and implementation of DRR and CCA. This shared learning will strengthen the rigor, robustness, effectiveness and efficiency in addressing climate change and disaster risks long-term [

 <xref rid="B109-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]. For example, informing disaster risk with the latest climate knowledge and adaptation expertise has been suggested in broader DRR and CCA strategies and is also applicable in health [

Similarly, linking DRR and CCA within the health sector can maximize operational synergies by reducing the burden of implementing DRR and CCA separately, including duplicated human and financial resources, particularly in resource constrained contexts [

Technical and operational synergies are presented together here as often the implementation of DRR and CCA (the operational aspect) cannot be separated from the tools and expertise behind DRR and CCA action (the technical aspect). Some opportunities identified in the literature for technical and operational synergies include: synergies in policy; joint risk and vulnerability assessments; health system strengthening and resilience of health systems; Early Warning Systems (EWS) and risk communication; as well as disaster preparedness and response.
