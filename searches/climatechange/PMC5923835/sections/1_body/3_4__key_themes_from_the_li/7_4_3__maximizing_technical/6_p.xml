<p class="p">Building the resilience of health infrastructure to disasters is relatively well established within DRR. There is technical guidance on the prevention and preparedness of health facilities dating back to the 2000s [

 <xref rid="B132-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">132</xref>]. However, the extent of use of these approaches is currently unknown. Commonly the climate change literature refers to ‘climate-proofing’ health infrastructure [

 <xref rid="B74-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] with little mention of how this fits in with existing DRR efforts. However, there are examples of where this is becoming less prevalent, such as the SMART hospital initiative which offers guidance on how to combine infrastructure resilience with reducing carbon emissions in hospitals [
 <xref rid="B128-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">128</xref>]. Recent technical guidance for DRR in Hospital facilities, known as the Safe Hospitals Initiative, also includes resilience to future risks and specifically names climate change as key for consideration [
 <xref rid="B125-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">125</xref>]. It is important to build on the technical expertise developed in both of these approaches to maximize synergies in implementation. However, the application of this in middle and low-income countries is underexplored.
