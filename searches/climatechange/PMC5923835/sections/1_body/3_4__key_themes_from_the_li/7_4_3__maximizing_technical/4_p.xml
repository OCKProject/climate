<p class="p">The consideration of health impact pathways has been highlighted as an important and useful way to examine underlying vulnerabilities to climate-sensitive disasters and climate change [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Focusing on the pathway between a climate-related event or hazard, and the health outcome, and performing integrated risk assessments, enables health professionals to identify key causes of climate change and disaster risks in health simultaneously and identify opportunities for intervention, including necessary broader approaches at systems level [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. This presents a potential method for identifying common disaster and climate change vulnerabilities related to health, as well as technical and operation synergies in risk reduction and adaptation strategies. Few [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] states that interventions to reduce health risks of climatic hazards occur at multiple points along the health impact pathway, with the understanding that a holistic and long-term approach is needed in reducing risks. For example, Few [
 <xref rid="B80-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>] suggests that climate change mitigation action even be incorporated in the reconstruction of health facilities post-disaster, as well as the consideration in long-term changes in hazard characteristics resulting from climate change. Therefore, when considering an impacts pathways approach, there is an opportunity for health professionals to consider the full spectrum of upstream to downstream risk reduction and adaptation actions. Thus, this potentially creates greater opportunities for identifying strategies for long-term proactive risk reduction and adaptation [
