<p class="p">The operational synergies of the above suggested synergies exist in the commitment and maintenance of human and financial resources dedicated to the implementation of joint DRR and CCA action in health. There has been wide recognition of the operational needs to link DRR and CCA in the context of the health sector [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The seven areas of potential technical synergies discussed above—joint policy processes; health systems strengthening; consideration of health impact pathways for identifying opportunities for joint intervention; risk and vulnerability assessment; resilience of health infrastructure; EWS and risk communication; and disaster preparedness and response—are also opportunities for potential operational synergies.
