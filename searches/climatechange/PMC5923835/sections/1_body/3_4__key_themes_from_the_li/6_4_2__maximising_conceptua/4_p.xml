<p class="p">As DRR and CCA continue to become more concerned with building resilience, and reducing underlying risks and vulnerabilities, DRR and CCA will have greater conceptual overlaps [

 <xref rid="B88-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">88</xref>]. Resilience, risk and vulnerability concepts present potential opportunities for building conceptual synergies between DRR and CCA in health. However, the utility of these concepts to link DRR and CCA in health is still unknown. Further exploration is needed to understand how these concepts serve as potential joint pathways for linking DRR and CCA and thus reducing health impacts.
