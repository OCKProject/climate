First, health emergency preparedness and response has been discussed as reducing climate change vulnerability and disaster risk [

 <xref rid="B103-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. Incorporation of the social determinants of health has been suggested as a potential opportunity to strengthen both DRR [

Further to this, anchoring DRR and CCA in health on the social determinants of ill-health and vulnerability has been suggested as a potential strategy for building synergy in addressing climate change risk over the long-term [
