<p class="p">Commonalities have also been drawn between the concept of vulnerability and the determinants of health in disaster and climate change literature [

 <xref rid="B136-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">136</xref>]. Public health professionals are inherently familiar with, and have an understanding of, the various causes of underlying risks, including vulnerabilities and complex interactions of determinants of health, including in the context of climate change and disasters [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>,

 <xref rid="B104-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. This familiarity and experience are useful for interpreting and addressing the direct and indirect health impact pathways, and simultaneous underlying disaster [
 <xref rid="B67-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] and climate change risks [
 <xref rid="B104-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">104</xref>]. Furthermore, public health professionals are accustomed to addressing similar types of risk through preventative strategies [
 <xref rid="B63-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Population/public and primary health services work across scales, with a significant focus on communities and vulnerable groups [
 <xref rid="B103-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">103</xref>]. As such, public health professionals are accustomed to varying risk profiles within populations, as well as addressing health vulnerabilities and needs in complex socio-ecological systems [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The unique positioning of the health sector within the community has the potential to improve implementation of CCA and DRR strategies in health as local-level action is important within complex multi-level adaptation and risk reduction [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B61-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]. Public health professionals are also experienced in engaging and empowering communities to appropriately address their needs [
 <xref rid="B138-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">138</xref>]. Thus, public health professionals are well-positioned to understand and address the simultaneous climate change and disaster health risks that communities and vulnerable populations face.
