<p class="p">Linking DRR and CCA in health is critical for effectively addressing the numerous health impacts of disasters and climate change. As the role of health grows in both DRR and CCA, the need for linking these two approaches will increase. Linking DRR and CCA in health is fundamental to maximise conceptual linkages in order to reach common goals including building resilience, and reducing risk and vulnerability. Therefore, there is a need for empirical research to investigate if and how these common concepts can facilitate linkages between DRR and CCA in health. Similarly, linking these two fields can build technical and operational synergies. So doing builds on: existing expertise and resources available in each field, including in policy; health systems strengthening; risk and vulnerability assessment; resilience of health infrastructure; EWS and risk communication; disaster preparedness and response; and the examination of health impact pathways to identify points for joint intervention. Health professionals and administrators play a vital role in building these links due to their experience in dealing with risks and complex health problems, and potential familiarity with concepts and approaches in DRR and CCA. However, there is currently a lack of in-depth knowledge on how these links can be advanced and the forms they take, as well as the opportunities, challenges and enablers for building and sustaining these links. Therefore, empirical examination of the development of links between DRR and CCA in health is necessary in order to understand how best to address the growing health risks from climate change and climate-sensitive disasters.</p>
