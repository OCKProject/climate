<p class="p">A large body of research has suggested that building links between DRR and CCA in the context of sustainable development is essential and important to ensure a robust approach to dealing with climate-sensitive disasters and their associated risks [

Linking DRR and CCA strategies makes operational sense as it will enable countries to enhance coherency and synergies between DRR and CCA approaches, as well as maximize efficiency in terms of the human, technical and financial resources used to reach common goals, thus reducing the use of resources in duplicated institutional structures and implementation [

Additionally, linking these two approaches makes technical sense, enabling the sharing of expertise, knowledge, lessons and tools between the two fields, thus increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of risk reduction and adaptation particularly through the consideration of long-term risk and adoption of long-term adaptation options [

For example, linking DRR with CCA and climate change science has been recognized as necessary for improving DRR strategies, understanding risk, dealing with uncertainties, addressing increasing vulnerability as a result of climate change, and reducing the potential for maladaptation [
