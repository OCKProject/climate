 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Climate change and climate-sensitive disasters impact health through common direct and indirect pathways potentially resulting in increased risk of death, disease and injury, as discussed in Banwell et al. [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] in this special issue. An increase in well-planned, effective and appropriate adaptation and risk reduction is necessary over the short-, medium- and long-terms to address climate change and climate-sensitive disaster risks [

 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Increasing health action in two broad management paradigms, Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA), under the umbrella of sustainable development, has a significant role to play in this process. This is reflected in key international DRR and CCA policies, and comes as a result of the ever-growing role of health in these contexts [

Here, health is used to broadly refer to the government and non-government actors on international, national, sub-national and local levels with a role in public and primary health care, as has been used in previous literature (e.g., [
