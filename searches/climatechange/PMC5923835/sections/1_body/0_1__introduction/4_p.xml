<p class="p">Health is an important end point for both climate change and disasters, and the recognition of the role of health is growing in both DRR and CCA internationally [

 <xref rid="B46-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. To support these requests there is a need to clearly articulate why linking DRR and CCA is important in health. Furthermore, there are significant knowledge gaps around how to develop these links. There is a need to draw this literature together and summarise what is currently known to strengthen the advocacy for building links in health and identify areas for future work. Therefore, this article reviews relevant literature to provide a synopsis of what is currently known about linking DRR and CCA in health. It aims to provide a strong and coherent rationale for building links in health, discuss what the current literature conveys about how these links can occur, as well as highlight current knowledge gaps. In doing so it intends to serve as the foundation for driving future work on how these links can be formed and advanced.
