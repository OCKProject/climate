Health practitioners have played a pivotal role in responding to health needs in emergencies and disasters, such as disease outbreaks and epidemics including smallpox or HIV/AIDs, natural disasters and human conflict, long before the establishment of health preparedness, response, risk reduction or risk management approaches [

 <xref rid="B54-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>], DRR in health has undergone considerable transformation in the last two decades.
