<p class="p">Research in CCA in health is still dominated largely by the quantification of risks, identifying vulnerabilities within populations, and projecting changes to health risks. However, there remains a need for this data and information to be accessible, understood and used by policy and decision-makers [

 <xref rid="B77-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. Furthermore, there is a need for research on the interaction between CCA in health and other global processes, such as DRR [
 <xref rid="B69-ijerph-15-00793" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. The following sections discuss why linking DRR and CCA is particularly important in health, and how these links can be made.
