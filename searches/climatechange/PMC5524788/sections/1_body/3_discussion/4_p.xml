<p id="Par29" class="p">There are certain caveats and assumptions in this model. First, like most niche models, it does not include evolutionary adaption or localized phenotypic plasticity, and the response of the population to abiotic predictors is assumed to be constant. The impact of evolution on population size is impossible to predict, and

Chlorophyll was not used in this study due to the limited number of presently-available earth system models that project potential temperature, potential salinity, and chlorophyll under multiple RCP scenarios.
