 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> would be absent (probability of occurrence &lt;0.1) by 2050–2059 under the IPCC B2 scenario. This discrepancy could be due to a variety of reasons, including the lower spatial resolution of the climate model analyzed in that study (MPI-ECHAM4, 1° × 1°), the lack of seasonal temporal resolution, different 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> life cycle stages used to train the model, and structural differences of the statistical models. Each of these projections used different climate scenarios, and Reygondeau and Beaugrand used the least severe scenario of the three, indicating that climate scenarios are unlikely to be the cause for the discrepancy between the models.
