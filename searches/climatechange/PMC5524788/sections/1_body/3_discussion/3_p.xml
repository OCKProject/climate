Neither the WOA climatology nor the climate models are designed to capture internal variability, and we spatially averaged all observations in the sampled timeseries into 0.25Â° bins before training the final model. Internal variability is projected in each climate model, however, it is not synchronized with present day conditions and the multi-model mean averages across the interannual variability. It is possible that indices of internal variability, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation, could have improved model fit to the individual sample years

 </sup>, but these indices would not be linked to modelled hydrography and are too difficult to reliably forecast in climate models to be useful future predictors. Advances in computational resources along with improved predictions of internal variability will greatly aid climate model projections of living marine resources, particularly for near-future management decisions
