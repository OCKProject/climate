<p id="Par31" class="p">Despite shortcomings of coarse climate models and simple delta downscaling, the comparison with high-resolution GFDL CM2.6 supports the accuracy of our methods here. The two models were within 12% of one another throughout the shelf; however, GFDL CM2.6 showed a more nuanced projection (Fig.Â

 </sup>. The ensemble projected greater losses in the Bay of Fundy, Southern New England, and around Cape Cod, likely due to the shallow bathymetry in these regions that were still not resolved in the downscaling.
