 </sup>. Depth was obtained from ETOPO2, a bathymetric representation of 2′ satellite altimetry (National Geophysical Data Center 2006). To match the resolution of other variables, the ETOPO2 bathymetry was spatially averaged into 0.25° bins. Depth was assumed to be consistent in all time periods and scenarios examined.
