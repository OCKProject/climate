<p id="Par13" class="p">We obtained ocean temperature and salinity projections from 6 general circulation models and earth system models used in the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5). These particular climate models (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) were chosen because they are the only models currently available on the Earth System Grid Federation database that contain potential temperature and salinity over historical (1955–2005) and future (2006–2100) Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) climate scenarios 8.5 and 4.5.
