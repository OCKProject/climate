 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> density, we created a spatially and temporally resolved generalized additive model (GAM) following two different climate change scenarios. We used sampled density and environmental data, a species distribution model developed from those data, global climate model projections under two climate change scenarios, and a contemporary, regional climatology of temperature and salinity. We compared projections from coarse resolution climate models (~100-km ocean component) downscaled to a higher resolution climatology (~25-km ocean component) to projections made using a recently developed high-resolution global climate model (~10-km ocean component).
