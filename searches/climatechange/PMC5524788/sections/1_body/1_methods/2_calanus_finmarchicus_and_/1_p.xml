 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) were obtained from NOAA NMFS surveys spanning 1977–2013. These surveys consisted of bongo tows (61-cm diameter) at depths of 200 m (or 5 m from the bottom) at stations across the Northeast U.S. Shelf

 </sup>. Tows were omitted from analysis if surface and bottom temperatures and salinities were not measured in conjunction with the tow. Based on these criteria, 17,159 samples were available for analysis from across the Northeast U.S. Shelf over 37 years. To better account for seasonal variability in

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic>, we categorized the data into six mean bimonthly “seasons” (January-February, March-April, etc.) and included season as a categorical variable in our model. The 17,159 samples and corresponding environmental variables were averaged into 0.25° bins for each season (N = 2654, 459–487 samples/season, median 6 samples/bin; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This ensured a balanced distribution of samples across the shelf, reducing spatial and temporal correlation of the model residuals. Geographic variability was analyzed by separating the Northwest Atlantic into four regions: the Gulf of Maine, Georges Bank, Southern New England, and the Mid-Atlantic Bight (Fig.
