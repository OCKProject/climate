Using 70% of the data, we compared all 63 possible combinations of the 6 variables in the GAM using AIC, deviance explained, and correct presence/absence classification percentage of the test data. This was repeated 100 times. Within the GAM, a Wald test determined whether the effect of a parameter is significantly different from zero. Although AIC was lowest using all variables, the effect of SST was weak (p = 0.053) and adjusted R
