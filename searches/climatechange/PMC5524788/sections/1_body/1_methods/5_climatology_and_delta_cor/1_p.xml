<p id="Par16" class="p">Due to the relatively coarse resolution of the CMIP5 global climate models (~1° × 1°; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>), we downscaled the projections using the delta approach with a higher-resolution (~0.25° × 0.25° × 57 depth levels) climatology from the World Ocean Atlas (WOA). This climatology was constructed by the NOAA National Ocean Data Center from spatially interpolated observations, with the final product consisting of averaged ten year increments from 1955–2012

 </sup>. The downscaling procedure takes the difference between the climate projections any given year and the initial climatology of that particular model, regrids it to the same resolution as the WOA climatology, and adds it to the WOA baseline. This technique preserves the resolved oceanographic features of the WOA dataset while still accounting for change indicated by the climate models
