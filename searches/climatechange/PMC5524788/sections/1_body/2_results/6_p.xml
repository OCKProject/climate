<p id="Par24" class="p">Six climate models were used for this analysis, each projecting historical, RCP 8.5, and RCP 4.5 conditions (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). All of the climate models projected similar trends in density and none were obvious outliers (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The hindcasts from the individual models were similar, with a coefficient of variation (CV; standard deviation/mean) of 0.14. This is substantially smaller than the CV between individual years of the sampled time series (CV = 1.40). As expected, the models agreed less by 2081–2100 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). By 2081–2100, the RCP 8.5 models had a CV of 0.30 and the RCP 4.5 models had a CV of 0.25. For both scenarios, the standard deviation among the six models was highest in the central and western Gulf of Maine in May-August.
