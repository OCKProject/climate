 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> density during the sampling period, averaging 7% higher than the samples over all stations and seasons. The largest discrepancy between the observations and the model occurred in Southern New England, with the model averaging 31% lower than the observations (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Averaged over all seasons, Georges Bank was accurate (3% lower than observations), but is clearly overestimating September-December. Like the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England, the high percentages are caused by the very low sampled winter density. Averaged across all regions, the model was more accurate March-June (+8%), and was low in November-February (−20%). These seasonal averages are dominated by the Gulf of Maine, which is larger in area and initial density. The model overestimates (&lt;10%) the central Gulf of Maine in March-April, and in the northeast in May-June (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). All of the following results are in relation to the modeled present day density, and the observations are not considered further.
