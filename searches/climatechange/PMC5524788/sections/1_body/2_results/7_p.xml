<p id="Par25" class="p">Despite the difference in forcings between RCP 8.5 and TCR, the two scenarios showed similar changes in space and density over all seasons. However, GFDL CM2.6 projected a less uniform change in density (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). The largest discrepancy was on the shelf break and the Northeast Channel, which are both poorly resolved in the ensemble of coarse models, with GFDL CM2.6 projecting ~50% mean decrease in

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> density and the ensemble projecting changes ~30% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Based on this, it is also possible that the ensemble underestimates losses in the Central Gulf of Maine and overestimates losses in Southern New England, yet the projections from each method are still within 12% of each other. Overall, the total change in density between the two time periods in the ensemble and GFDL CM2.6 had a correlation coefficient of 0.51.
