 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> decline in the Mid-Atlantic Bight and Southern New England is small compared to other regions, but proportionally greater due to the much smaller present-day populations, especially in the deeper areas (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). These regions are impacted the most in the winter months and along the shelf edge. Despite being located at the trailing edge of the range, the southern Mid-Atlantic Bight has the smallest percentage decreases in the entire study area, losing ~20%. This may be misleading, as there is so few
