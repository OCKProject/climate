 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Depth is positively related to density up to 400 m, while BT is negatively related. Both bottom and surface salinity appear to have a negative influence when greater than ~34. Lower BS may be more beneficial. However despite minor multicollinearity (max VIF = 4.22) between these variables, all were still significant in the final GAM (p ≪ 0.01) after SST was removed. A variogram of the model pearson residuals showed very little spatial autocorrelation (Supplemental Figure
