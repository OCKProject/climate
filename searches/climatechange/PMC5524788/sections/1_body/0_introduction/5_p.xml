 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> populations on the Northeast U.S. Shelf will be impacted in the future by climate change, we examined six climate models to determine how the fundamental niche of

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> is expected to change with continued global warming. Using these projected temperatures and salinities, we created a generalized additive model (GAM)

 <italic class="italic">finmarchicus</italic> density over space and season through 2100. GAMs provide a flexible, nonparametric model that have frequently been used to project species density
