  <p class="p">Comparison of the ensemble (0.25° RCP 8.5) and GFDL (.1° TCR). Time periods are twenty year annual averages for 1986–2005 of the historical ensemble scenario and 2041–2060 of RCP 8.5, compared to the same years 1–20 and 61–80 of GFDL CM 2.6 TCR scenario. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Early density of ensemble RCP 8.5 and (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) GFDL CM 2.6 TCR. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) The percentage change between the late and early time periods of ensemble RCP 8.5 and (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) GFDL CM2.6 TCR. (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) The difference in the percentage change in density projected by each model (7d-7c). Warm colors indicate that the ensemble projects greater losses than GFDL in those regions. Correlation between the differences projected by the ensemble and GFDL CM 2.6 is 0.51. Figure was created by the first author in MATLAB v2015b (https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) using the package ‘M_Map’ v1.4 h (https://www.eoas.ubc.ca/~rich/map.html).
