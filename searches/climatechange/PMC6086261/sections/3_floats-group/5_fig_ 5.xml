   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Agriculture Information Management System (AIMS). 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Sustainable Agriculture Inputs (SAI)—Fertilisers management: Nodes on the map represent the 66 actors in the network across levels. The coloured nodes (
   <italic class="italic">red</italic>) represent the actors relevant for the AIMS and SAI interventions. The edges between the actors are weighted to represent multiple relations and strength of interactions between the actors. The 
   <italic class="italic">green edges</italic> show the functional links between the actors and the 
   <italic class="italic">red edges</italic> represent the missing links that need to be established. The node size of actors is proportional to the number of weighted edges connected to the node. Refer to Table S1 in the Supplementary Electronic Material for names of actors
