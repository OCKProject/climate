<p id="Par13" class="p">The objective of RAP framework is to develop robust plans to balance the need for short-term responses and adapting to the long-term consequences of climate change. Unlike traditional organisational plans that emphasise clear objectives and steps to achieve specific goals (Bolman and Deal 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2013</xref>; Daft et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>); RAP encompasses strategies that incorporate multiple interpretations of climate change and adaptation, without demanding a unified definition of adaptation (Lempert and Schlesinger

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>) robust action ‘multi-vocal inscription’ and the ‘participatory architecture’ strategies that promote structures and rules for interaction among many actors across levels, which creatively combine opposing views on the problems of defining adaptation and selecting responses. Multi-vocal inscription, where a single action can be inscribed and interpreted from many perspectives (Padgett and Ansell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">1993</xref>), offers an appropriate strategy to sustain engagement even when consensus is unlikely.
