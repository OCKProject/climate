We also adopted a multi-relational approach, which is a valuable analytical area for SNA (Wellman and Wortley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88" class="xref">1990</xref>). The analysis elicited four types of interactions among the actors that collectively help to assess capacity for adaptation: (1) flow of resources, (2) knowledge transfer, (3) service exchange, and (4) social connections. For instance, flow of resources can lead to improved agricultural productivity and diversity creating a virtuous cycle of income and investment (Deressa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2009</xref>). Knowledge transfer can enable the exchange of traditional and expert ideas between organisations that address climatic risks, and encourage suitable adaptive practices (Folke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2002</xref>). Social connections may not directly influence adaptation, but it links actors with others who are important resources.
