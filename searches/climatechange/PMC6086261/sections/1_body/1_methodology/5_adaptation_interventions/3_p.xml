<p id="Par43" class="p">The AIMS was developed by the RAP research team (with experts for the RAP testing) and its focus is to produce a comprehensive agricultural extension policy and accompanying legislative instrument to close the gap between the current extension support offered by the government, and the needs of local farmers. AIMS disseminates to local farmers (and for training extension staff) information on appropriate adaptation strategies and technologies in the form of workshops, field demonstrations, trainings and literature. This would enable the exchange of traditional and expert ideas between local communities and external actors to address climate challenges and encourage suitable adaptive practices. The head of an NGO aptly pointed out that “
 <italic class="italic">whenever a new (agricultural) technology is discovered, it needs to be communicated to the farmer. Capacity building for program officers, technical, agricultural extension officers, is key and that is where the bulk of the funding should be going”</italic> (Personal communication 2013). Similarly, an extension officer attributed low extension support on the shortage of funds suggesting that “
 <italic class="italic">as an extension worker, you get frustrated…because you do not have the resources for your plans. So when you see the farmer you start avoiding him</italic>” (Personal communication 2013).
