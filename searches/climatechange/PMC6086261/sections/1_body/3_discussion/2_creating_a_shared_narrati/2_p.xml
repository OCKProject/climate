<p id="Par66" class="p">As a result when designing/implementing adaptation actions it is not simply about deciding whether to take either a top-down or a bottom-up vision, but also to recognise that responses lie across levels, especially in strategic collaboration and coordination or roles and responsibilities. An official from the Ministry of Finance (MoF) reinforced this multilevel approach by saying that “
 <italic class="italic">we don’t do top</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">down planning. [Instead] it is top</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">down and bottom</italic>-
 <italic class="italic">up, because the policy comes from the top, but the activities come from the ground to satisfy those policies</italic>” (personal communication 2014). However, this understanding is also simplistic as the implementation of policy is often spread across actors and levels, rather than confined to just a few actors at a particular level.
