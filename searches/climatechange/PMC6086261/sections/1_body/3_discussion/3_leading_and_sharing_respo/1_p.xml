<p id="Par72" class="p">A problem in developing a shared understanding of the adaptation challenge (and the responses required) is deciding 
 <italic class="italic">who</italic> leads the process and 
 <italic class="italic">how</italic> responsibilities are shared among the various actors and participants. During the RAP process, identifying the most appropriate actors to champion the activities was difficult, as their roles and scopes for action are not always clear. Conventional organisations such as private sector for-profit organisations usually have a definite line of authority where action, activities, and roles are clear (Daft et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2010</xref>), while adaptation regimes need to be dynamic and fluid (Folke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2005</xref>).
