<p id="Par63" class="p">During the implementation of RAP in Ghana, there were many ‘aha’ moments where participants discovered roles and actors that they were previously unaware of. For example, when illustrating lessons learned from the RAP process one climate NGO official pointed out that “
 <italic class="italic">farmers are undertaking so many activities already in the area of adaptation, which they don’t know is adaptation</italic>” (personal communication 2014). Similarly, participants identified and debated the somewhat ambiguous and overlapping role of regional actors at the local level, which tends to lead to inaction and gaps in offering support. This realization can provide an effective means of supporting existing adaptation processes rather than overriding them with outside models.
