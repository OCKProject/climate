<p id="Par12" class="p">The paper begins with a theoretical introduction to robust adaptation planning for climate change. We do not provide a comprehensive literature review of the disciplines underpinning RAP since these are mature, well researched and widely accepted (e.g. Ferraro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>; Mikkelsen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59" class="xref">2005</xref>; Scott and Carrington 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">2011</xref>). Instead, we discuss aspects that are important for developing the RAP approach. We then outline the five-step RAP framework and the methodology adopted for the specific application in Ghana. We present the main findings from the application, assess the usefulness of the RAP framework in a multi-actor and multi-level setting, and outline future opportunities and recommendations for its application.
