<p id="Par7" class="p">The published literature recognises that good collaboration among affected stakeholders is crucial for effective adaptation action (Bodin and Crona

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2005</xref>). However, there is little information about suitable methods and frameworks for coordinating the actions of different actors, and developing responses to climate change across multiple levels of time, space, and socio-political organisation. Much of the recent work on adaptation has focused either at broad policy and governance levels (Sandstr√∂m and Rova 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2009</xref>; Stein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2011</xref>; Vignola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">2013</xref>), or at highly context-specific local levels through local case studies (Reid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72" class="xref">2007</xref>; Schipper et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2014</xref>). Actually adaptation studies have seldom focused across levels (Sova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" class="xref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2016</xref>). Even when actors and adaptation actions are identified, it has been challenging to organise the necessary communication and implementation across levels and scales (Hajer and Wagenaar

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2013</xref>).
