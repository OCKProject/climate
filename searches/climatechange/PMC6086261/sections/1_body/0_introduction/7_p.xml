<p id="Par8" class="p">To meet this gap, we introduce a five-step framework, namely Robust Adaptation Planning (RAP). In particular the scope of RAP is to assist the planning of appropriate interventions to respond to the wicked and grand sustainability challenge of climate change adaptation. RAP builds on the ‘robust action’ approach that is defined as “noncommittal actions that keep future lines of action open in strategic contexts” (Padgett and Powell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">2012</xref>, p. 24). Robust action offers a suitable base for the RAP framework as it encourages responses to immediate climate change impacts without losing sight of long-term trends and emerging needs (Ferraro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2015</xref>; Nair and Howlett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63" class="xref">2016</xref>; Padgett and Ansell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69" class="xref">1993</xref>). RAP leverages existing institutional structures and stakeholder networks by using diverse actors to plan, sequence and time adequate strategies across many levels to reduce risks of failure and avoid duplication (Adner
