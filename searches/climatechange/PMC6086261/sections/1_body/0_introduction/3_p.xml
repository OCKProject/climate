<p id="Par4" class="p">Unprecedented and coordinated responses are required of many disparate actors, from national governments, and international organisations to civil society and individual researchers/practitioners in order to help vulnerable populations adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change (Bryson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">2004</xref>; Ostrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">2010a</xref>). Invariably, the objectives, motives and actions of these actors are incompatible or misaligned with the goal of effective adaptation to climate change, leading to ill-defined and weak responses (Chaudhury et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2016b</xref>; Mermet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">2011</xref>). Capturing the different motives, perception, and roles of these many actors under a unified framework is a major challenge (Etzion et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2015</xref>), but necessary to develop effective climate change adaptation strategies and plans for agricultural systems.
