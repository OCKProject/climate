<p id="Par5" class="p">Identifying strategies and responses that are practical, sound and meet the actors’ varied interests requires careful and flexible planning. This is challenging because most adaptation measures are usually planned and implemented by public actors within national structures that are rigidly bureaucratic, incremental, and often underemphasise the role of many other actors (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2005</xref>; Scott 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">1998</xref>). Added to this complexity is the lack of consensus on defining adaptation (Adger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2003</xref>; Füssel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2007</xref>; Smit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2000</xref>) or characterising the scales and levels involved in tackling adaptation (e.g. temporal and spatial scales) (Cash and Moser 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2000</xref>; Gibson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">2000</xref>).
