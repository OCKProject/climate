<p class="p">Going into the detail of each expanded network, the 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA</italic> cluster (including 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA2</italic>) was found to interact with 
 <italic class="italic">VvUFGT</italic> and both genes were positively correlated with 
 <italic class="italic">VvAM1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvGST4</italic>, known to be involved in vacuolar sequestration of anthocyanins (

 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Interestingly, 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvUFGT</italic> were found interacting with 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF045</italic>, supporting the recently suggested role of this factor in regulating genes of the anthocyanin pathway (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leida et al., 2016</xref>), and with other five 
 <italic class="italic">MYBA</italic> regulators and enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway (
 <italic class="italic">CCOMT</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CSHIK</italic>_
 <italic class="italic">ESTER</italic>). The MYC1 interaction with the two transcription factors VvWRKY26 and VvMYBC2-L4, recently characterized as regulators of both Anthocyanin and PAs biosynthesis (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Amato et al., 2017</xref>), confirms its involvement in both pathways. Apparently, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA is not able to clearly solve the cases of multifactors-mediated regulation such as the case of the known MBW mode of action. However, we cannot appreciate whether this is due to the mining approach or to the intrinsic multilevel nature of the regulation which could be not purely transcriptional.
