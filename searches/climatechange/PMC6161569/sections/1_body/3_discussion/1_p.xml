<p class="p">In the field of viticulture, growing attention is dedicated to investigate plant adaptation and stress responses to climate change, as this represents the main challenge for the near future (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ger√≤s et al., 2015</xref>). Here we present an 
 <italic class="italic">in silico</italic> approach to extend our knowledge on gene networks related to plant-environment interaction, relevant for berry quality and water stress response, with the final aim to identify novel candidates to drive experimental work. Anthocyanin and stilbenoid synthesis are known to be deeply affected by changes in external conditions, such as air temperature, water availability and solar radiation type and intensity (
