<p class="p">Interestingly, among the top-100 genes of the “Stilbenoids” LGN expansion (
 <bold class="bold">Supplementary Table 
  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2" class="xref">S2</xref>
 </bold>), there is a Group II WRKY transcription factor, 
 <italic class="italic">VvWRKY18</italic>, which represents a potential new interesting candidate for the regulation of this pathway. On the other hand, the 
 <italic class="italic">VvWRKY</italic> genes proposed by 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vannozzi et al. (2018)</xref> as involved in the regulation of 
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS</italic> genes are not present in the NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA output. The approach of Gene Co-expression Network analysis based on the MR index of co-expression proved to be more suited to identify direct interactions, such as the regulator of a target. Nonetheless, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA expansion of 
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS29</italic> actually identifies 
 <italic class="italic">VvWRKY03</italic> (not shown), confirming that when applied to a single gene, the two approaches produce similar results.
