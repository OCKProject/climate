<p class="p">“ERFs” expansion network reflected the bipartite structure of the input set, in which the two SHINE genes (
 <italic class="italic">VvERF042/44</italic>) were inversely related to 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF045.</italic> The only common gene is represented by a DREB transcription factor. 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF042/44</italic>, uncharacterized in grapevine, were found correlated with numerous genes involved in cuticle metabolism such as 
 <italic class="italic">Acyl-LCS, WAX SYNTH, LIP-GDSL, EPOXY-Hyd</italic> (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yeats and Rose, 2013</xref>) and one gene linked to stomatal closure regulation, 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB60</italic>, (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Galbiati et al., 2011</xref>), supporting the hypothesis that also in grapevine they could play a role in the control of transpiration. Interestingly, 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF042</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF044</italic> are the putative orthologs of the 
 <italic class="italic">Arabidopsis</italic>
 <italic class="italic">SHINE1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">SHINE3</italic> genes, whose silencing leads to a decrease in cutin load and to changes in cell wall structure (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Shi et al., 2011</xref>), and they resulted down-regulated in grapevine transgenic lines overexpressing 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF045</italic> (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leida et al., 2016</xref>). 
 <italic class="italic">VvERF045</italic> which is specifically induced at véraison (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leida et al., 2016</xref>), seems to interact with other transcription factors (
 <italic class="italic">ERF0003-like, bHlH</italic>) and genes involved in signaling, suggesting it could be a higher level regulator of berry ripening. “ABA” input network showed a complete connection between 
 <italic class="italic">ABI1, HB7, AREB2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LRK10</italic>, thus representing a very co-expressed module, 
 <italic class="italic">VvNAC026</italic> instead was exclusively connected to 
 <italic class="italic">AREB2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">LRK10</italic> and could represent a second-order, more specialized, level of regulation. This interaction supports the involvement of 
 <italic class="italic">VvNAC026</italic> in berry size determination via positive regulation of ABA synthesis, as recently proposed by 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tello et al. (2015)</xref>. The expanded network was highly enriched in signaling components, such as transcription factors (
 <italic class="italic">VvbZIP12, VvbZIP40, VvWRKY30, Divaricata, VvERF13, NF-YA9</italic>) and kinases/phosphorilases (
 <italic class="italic">PP2C</italic>_6, 
 <italic class="italic">AHP4, RPK</italic>), thus proposing novel candidates to expand ABA regulatory network. Interestingly, the Nuclear Factor 
 <italic class="italic">YA9</italic> is reported to be induced by salt and PEG treatments and possibly related to seed maturation and dehydration signaling in grapevine (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ren et al., 2016</xref>).
