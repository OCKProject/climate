<p class="p">Considering the “Stilbenoids” expansion network, the already known interactions within the input gene set were confirmed: 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB15</italic> were found to interact with eight stilbene synthases (
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS25</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">27</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">29</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">31, VvSTS41, VvSTS45</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS35</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">48</italic>) as supported by the recent evidences by 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wong et al. (2016)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vannozzi et al. (2018)</xref>, and with two peroxidases, 
 <italic class="italic">AN_PEROX_1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">CLIII_PEROX40</italic>, both co-expressed with 
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS41</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS45</italic> in VTCdb database. In addition, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA identified another MYB factor (
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB13</italic>), which shares close similarity in sequence and expression with 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB15</italic> (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Wong et al., 2016</xref>), and additionally a STS (
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS26</italic>) and a cluster of two peroxidases (
 <italic class="italic">AN_PEROX_2</italic>) which will be tested for their ability to catalyze stilbenoids synthesis and oligomerization during the grapevine response to abiotic and biotic stresses. The group of 
 <italic class="italic">PEROX_1, _2, _3</italic>, interacting with Vv
 <italic class="italic">MYB14</italic>, is found related to other peroxidases (
 <italic class="italic">PEROX_4, _5, _6</italic>), which could participate to stilbenoid metabolisms, as well.
