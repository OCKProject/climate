<p class="p">In conclusion, we have shown that NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA algorithm can be successfully applied to a non-model plant species transcriptomic data to expand LGNs, not necessarily fully characterized. It is meant to be used on a complete database including RNA-seq and microarray data - such as Vespucci - without losing the ability of identifying local specialized networks, in this study the flavonoid-related LGNs. Indeed, it represents a useful tool to mine the entire transcriptome to extend a LGN, on a system biology perspective, as it searches for genes highly connected to the whole LGN. For instance, it seems to find points of convergence between pathways, such as the case of the 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYC1</italic> gene bridging the Anthocyanin and Proanthocyanidin synthesis pathways. In the case of the ABA expansion, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA identifies many genes known to be related to this signaling network and many other transcription factors and genes representing interesting candidates for experimental characterization. However, we observed that NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA does not represent the best tool to find direct targets of transcription factors unless the single gene is analyzed.
