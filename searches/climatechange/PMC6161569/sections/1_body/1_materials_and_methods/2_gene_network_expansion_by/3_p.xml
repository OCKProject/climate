<p class="p">The networks found by the PC-algorithm are then post-processed off-line to determine and aggregate the final expansion gene lists. List aggregation is done with the ranking aggregation method Markov Chain 4 (MC4) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Dwork et al., 2001</xref>), since it has been shown to yield the most precise results (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Asnicar et al., 2016</xref>). For the MC4 ranking aggregation we decided to consider the first 1,000 genes of each expansion output list (
