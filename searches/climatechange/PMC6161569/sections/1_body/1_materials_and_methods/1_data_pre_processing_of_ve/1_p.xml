The pre-processing procedure comprised three steps: (1) removal of contrasts with more than 55% of missing values; (2) removal of genes with more than 55% of missing values; (3) for each gene, replacement of the remaining missing values with the median of its contrasts values. This procedure reduced the original dataset to 28,013 genes and 701 contrasts (
