<p class="p">In the attempt to highlight the difference between the expansion gene lists obtained using NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA and the simple correlation, both analyses have been performed on the same networks and the top 100 genes were considered for the comparison (

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM3" class="xref">S3</xref>
 </bold>). One more network was computed, made of just one gene, the transcription factor AREB2 included in the ABA network, because it represents the simplest network possible. The networks produced by the two approaches have been visualized, considering only the top 20â€“30 genes of the lists for clarity (

 </bold> and

  <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM4" class="xref">S4</xref>
 </bold>). While in the case of the simple correlation networks the genes are almost fully connected, the number of interactions retained by NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA is considerably reduced. A clear effect of the latter approach is the removal of not significant interactions, possibly those due to noisy or redundant information. This allows to reduce the complexity of the network and focus on the network topology and the most likely gene interactions. Jaccard similarity index curves were calculated to compare the expansion gene lists obtained. Quite interestingly, the expansions of the single-gene network obtained with NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA and simple correlation resulted the most similar ones, with a rather constant high value of Jaccard index (corresponding to about 60% overlap). Conversely, the curves for the LGN expansions showed different trends and in general a lower similarity, suggesting that when a network rather than a single gene is expanded, the two approaches identify different sets of genes.
