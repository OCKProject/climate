<p class="p">In the “Anthocyanins” network (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3A</xref>
 </bold>), all the genes of the expansion except 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBC2-L4</italic> were positively correlated with both 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA</italic> cluster (including 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA1</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBA2</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">VvUFGT</italic>, highlighting the intimate relationship of this pair in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYC1</italic> was positively correlated exclusively with 
 <italic class="italic">VvWRKY26</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYBC2-L4</italic>, which is in turn negatively correlated to 
 <italic class="italic">VvUFGT</italic>. Concerning the “Stilbenoids” network (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3B</xref>
 </bold>), characterized by a higher number of genes not fully confirmed by previous evidences, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA analysis provided first of all an interesting analysis of the LGN, showing its lower homogeneity. Indeed, 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB15</italic> were found interacting with all the stilbene synthases and three out of seven peroxidases, suggesting a minor involvement of the remaining four peroxidases in this pathway. Moreover, here we can appreciate the power of the PC-algorithm in eliminating spurious relationships in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">AN_PEROX, PEROX1</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic>. Indeed, they are all highly co-expressed, but only the interactions between the two peroxidases and 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic> were retained. 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14</italic> is indeed sufficient to explain the co-expression of the two enzymes, thus suggesting it could regulate the transcription of both. Widening to the expansion network, NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA identified one 
 <italic class="italic">STS</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">VvSTS26</italic>), one 
 <italic class="italic">MYB</italic> (
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB13</italic>) and a cluster of two peroxidase genes (
 <italic class="italic">AN_PEROX_2</italic>) related to the 
 <italic class="italic">VvMYB14-15</italic> system and then other peroxidases and stress related genes connected to the other peroxidases. The topology of the “ERFs
 <italic class="italic">”</italic> expansion network (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3C</xref>
 </bold>) revealed a bipartite structure with two 
 <italic class="italic">ERFs</italic> anti-correlated to the third one and two groups of related genes, one enriched in transcription factors (lower group) and the other in genes related to lipid and wax metabolism (upper group). Finally, “ABA” network (
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">3D</xref>
 </bold>) was characterized by a rather homogeneous distribution of the interactions both in the input and in the expanded gene sets. The interaction between 
 <italic class="italic">HB7_2</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">ABI1</italic> was confirmed. In general, the three transcription factors were connected to many other regulators, including a Nuclear Factor Y, whereas the two kinases interacted with other signaling proteins (
 <italic class="italic">DBPPP2C_6, AHP4</italic>).
