<p class="p">The four grapevine gene networks, namely “Anthocyanins,” “Stilbenoids,” “ERFs,” and “ABA,” were expanded using NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA in order to identify additional genes causally related to them. The overall flow of analysis is depicted in 
 <bold class="bold">Figure 
  <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">2A</xref>
 </bold>, where the case of “ERFs” LGN is reported as an example. To reduce computing complexity, the Vespucci normalized expression dataset was divided into either 29 tiles of 1,000 gene (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 1000) or 57 tiles of 500 genes (
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = 500). This step was repeated 2,000 times (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> = 2000) or 1,000 times (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic> = 1000). The three input genes of “ERFs” were present in each 
 <italic class="italic">tile</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">gene@home</italic> project allowed the distribution of the computation by the PC-algorithm as tiles to volunteers’ computers. Then, the partial results were post-processed to obtain four ranked lists of candidate genes and the corresponding interactions. The first 1,000 genes of each list were then aggregated using MC4 (
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> = 1000, see section “Material and Methods”). The first 22 genes of the aggregated list and their interactions with the “ERFs” network were used to depict the expanded network, whereas a larger list consisting of the top 100 genes was validated using Gene Ontology functional class enrichment, promoter analysis, and literature mining.
