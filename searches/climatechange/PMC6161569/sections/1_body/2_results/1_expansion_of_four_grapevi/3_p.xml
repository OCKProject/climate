<p class="p">The results of the expansions of the four grapevine networks are presented in 
 <bold class="bold">Table 
  <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>
 </bold>, where, for each set of parameters, the number of genes found and the number of interactions among them is reported. There is an evident dependence of the output gene number on the parameter settings. The first 1,000 genes of each of the four output lists were aggregated in order to have a refined final list, reported in the last column of
