 </bold>, given a 
 <italic class="italic">tile</italic>, the PC-algorithm produced a network that represents the putative causal interactions between the genes. The PC-algorithm, starting from the complete correlation network and given a pair of interacting genes, searched for a growing-dimension separation set of genes within the genes interacting with the pair. The 57,000 networks thus obtained were post-processed, that is, interactions between genes, and “ERFs” genes were counted over the iterations and ranked accordingly. Finally, the candidate genes were ranked with respect to the overall relative frequency of interaction with the input network.
