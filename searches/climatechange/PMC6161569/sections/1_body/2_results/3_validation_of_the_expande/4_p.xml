<p class="p">Promoter analysis produced different outputs for the four networks. The promoters of the genes of the “Anthocyanins” network were enriched in two 8-nt motifs, which were not present in the reference annotation database (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">O’Malley et al., 2016</xref>), meaning that these sequences have not been already characterized and therefore cannot be associated yet to a transcription factor. “ABA” network was highly enriched in three 8-nt motifs well annotated in the reference databases: two of them (CACBTGTC and CCACGTGK) matched with the motifs recognized by bHLH and/or bZIP AREB transcription factors and one (ACVCTCCT) by MYB88. “Stilbenoids” network retrieved a sequence of just 5-nt (ACGYG), rather unspecific since matching to 72 possible transcription factors belonging to several transcription factor families. Finally, in the “ERFs” network no enriched motifs could be found. Overall, this analysis suggests that despite the starting networks were composed, partly or exclusively, by transcription factors, the expansion sets not necessarily are enriched in their direct targets. Further experiments would be necessary to come to a more general conclusion.
