<p class="p">To estimate the biological relevance of the genes identified by NES
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA, we searched for public experimental data – not included in Vespucci compendium – with an experimental design suited to validate our networks and we could find them only for “ABA” and “Anthocyanins” networks. The dataset for “ABA” consisted in the genes modulated by ABA treatment in grapevine berry skins and in cell cultures (

 </bold> precision is initially very high and then decreases with the number of genes, suggesting that genes are ranked in a biologically relevant way. Considering the top 100 genes precision decreases to 40 and 20% in the case of “ABA” and “Anthocyanins,” respectively, suggesting that the top 100 genes of the expansion lists represents a reasonable trade-off between focusing on the strongest candidates of the expanded networks and preserving enough statistical power for the other analyses. Thus, this threshold was applied to the other two networks too.
