  <p class="p">Visualization of the difference between the Pearson correlation [ρ(A,B)] of two genes A and B and their partial correlation given the gene C [ρ(A,B| C)] as computed by the PC-algorithm. The top plot reports the normalized raw signals of A and B, their windowed Pearson correlation (window-size of 31 experiments for visualization sake), and the value of their Pearson correlation coefficient in the legend. In the middle plot the signal of C is introduced as well as the windowed correlations between A,C and B,C and the values of correlation. The bottom plot shows the simple correlation between A,B and the partial correlation of A,B given C. In this case the PC-algorithm, that systematically search for variables for separating pair of variables, would have considered the correlation between A and B as completely explained in terms of C (a separation set of dimension one) and removed the interaction between them for the successive steps.</p>
