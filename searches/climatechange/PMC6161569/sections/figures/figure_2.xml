  <p class="p">Overall view of the network expansion method. 
   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Summary graphical visualization of the application (using four parameters settings) of NES
   <sup class="sup">2</sup>RA to the ERFs LGN using data from the Vespucci compendium. Each tile, including all the genes of the LGN, generated during the subsetting step, is analysed using the PC-algorithm that runs on the volunteersâ€™ computers, made available through the 
   <italic class="italic">gene@home</italic> BOINC project. The post-processing takes as input all the resulting networks and ranks the genes using their relative frequency, measured as the number of times a gene was found connected to the input LGN. In the final expansion network, the nodes are the LGN (in yellow) and the top-ranking genes of the aggregated list (in light blue), whereas the edges derive from the union of all the found interactions. 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Details on the internal steps of the PC-algorithm that, starting from a complete graph, iteratively searches separation sets that allows the cut of an edge. For each tile, the result of the application of the PC-algorithm is a network.
