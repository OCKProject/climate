<p class="p">Moisture index on the land surface is expected to control vector habitat and malaria dynamics. Characterizing distribution of moisture dynamics associated with topographic depressions is thus critical to understand the life cycle of 
 <italic class="italic">Anopheles</italic> vectors and the transmission of malaria under a changing environment. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> shows the distribution of topographic depressions and moisture index identified in the study area. We find that topographic depressions are ubiquitous and exist across many sizes in the area (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004" class="xref">Fig 4a</xref>, red polygons). This feature is expected to result in the heterogeneity of breeding habitat distributions and vector abundance. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0211258.g004" class="xref">Fig 4b</xref> shows the exceedance probability on a log-log scale for the surface area 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic> of topographic depressions found at four different levels in the study area. We fit least square linear regression lines to these distributions at each level (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.93−0.96). The results show that the probability distribution approximates the power law fits 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>(

 <italic class="italic">x</italic>) ∝ 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>
 <sup class="sup">−
  <italic class="italic">α</italic>
 </sup> with slope 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> ranging from -2.26 to -2.06. Here, the slope 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> also represents the likelihood of having smaller size topographic depressions that are below the resolution observed by topographic data in the area. Water and material accumulated in these depressions provide potential habitat for mosquito’s breeding, thus affecting vector population. The mean 
 <italic class="italic">α</italic> is used for moisture index estimation in the SLIM model (see details in ref [
