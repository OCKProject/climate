<p class="p">Our results indicated that the proportion of asexual to sexual recruitment was the highest in the W treatment, followed by WG, C, and G. This finding was consistent with previous reports that showed that warming increased asexual recruitment but decreased the proportion of forbs in the alpine community (Yahdjian &amp; Sala,

Graminoids may be more sensitive to temperature than forbs and legumes because of their more flexible morphology and greater ability to absorb nutrients (Corazza, Tardella, Ferrari, &amp; Catorci, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Graminoids are generally taller and can provide shade to forbs and legumes in the plant community, which restricts the competition of forbs and legumes for light. Another important reason is root depth; generally, except for a few forbs with taproots, graminoid roots are deeper than those of forbs and legumes, so graminoid plants have higher utilization rates of water and nutrients than forbs and legumes in alpine meadows (Shen, Zhou, Chen, &amp; Zhou,
