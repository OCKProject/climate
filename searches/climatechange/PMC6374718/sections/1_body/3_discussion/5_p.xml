<p class="p">Previous studies showed that plant asexual recruitment was more important in lower temperature areas, that is to say, sexual recruitment plays only a small role in the seedling demographic of an alpine ecosystem (Evette, Bédécarrats, &amp; Bornette, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). However, in our study, we found that sexual reproduction increases markedly under grazing conditions. This finding was consistent with previous reports, which indicated that sexual reproduction was very important for seedling recruitment and community regeneration, especially in grazed alpine grasslands (Arft et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>; Forbis, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Grazing influenced the species composition, and the dominant functional groups changed from graminoids with asexual reproduction to forbs with sexual reproduction. Grazing also reduced the number of leguminous seedlings with sexual reproduction (Forbis, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The selective consumption by livestock induces strong changes in the relative abundance of plant species, thereby producing important impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning (Heggenes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). As is well known, palatable graminoids and legumes have a more competitive advantage than unpalatable forbs and legumes; thus, grazing may help the seedling recruitment of unpalatable forbs and legumes by decreasing their competition with graminoid species (Gallego, Distel, Camina, &amp; Rodríguez Iglesias, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>; Niu, He, Zhang, &amp; Lechowicz, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our study showed that palatable graminoids can be replaced by unpalatable forbs and legumes because yaks and Tibet sheep prefer graminoids over forbs. Animal ingestion also reduces the propagation and availability of palatable graminoids (Moore &amp; Elmendorf, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). In addition, grazing provides a favorable amount of sunlight and a greater nutrient availability for seed germination of forbs. The reduction in plant litter is another important mechanism affecting the community structure (Leinaas, Bengtsson, Janion‐Scheepers, &amp; Chown, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Violle, Richarte, &amp; Navas, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Previous study found that plant litter cover may have a negative effect on sexual recruitment (Loydi, Eckstein, Otte, &amp; Donath, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The reduction in sexual recruitment due to plant litter is because plant litter provides a shaded environment to the plant community (Letts, Lamb, Mischkolz, &amp; Romo, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Although litter has positive effects on soil moisture, the importance of soil moisture is limited as a large amount of precipitation is concentrated during seedling recruitment in this area. Therefore, grazing significantly reduced the proportion of asexual recruitment but increased the proportion of sexual recruitment in the alpine community.
