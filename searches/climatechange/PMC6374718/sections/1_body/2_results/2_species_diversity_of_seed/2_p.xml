<p class="p">ANOVA analyses showed that the warming treatment had significantly positive effects on the species richness of seedlings in the alpine meadow (Table

 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Averages of 15, 15.4, 18.8, and 16.6 species were found in C, G, W, and WG per plot (0.25Â m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>), respectively, and in total, 36 seedling species were recorded (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ece34799-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>). The diversity of the sexual recruitment seedlings was higher than that of asexual (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34799-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Grazing and the interactions between warming and grazing had no significant impact on plant richness. However, grazing reduced the effect of warming on seedling species richness, and sexual recruits accounted for 82% of the reduced species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Therefore, to generalize our findings, warming significantly increased the species diversity of the seedlings in the alpine meadows, while grazing reduced the response of the grasses to warming.
