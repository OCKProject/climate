<p class="p">Overall, warming significantly increased the number of plant seedlings for both sexual and asexual recruitment, and the proportion of asexual recruitment to sexual was highest in the W treatment, followed by WG, C, and G (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34799-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The maximum number of seedlings (1,000.8 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) was found in the W treatment, followed by WG (838.4 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), G (687.2 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>), and C (671.2 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Grazing significantly decreased seedling asexual recruitment, and the interaction between warming and grazing significantly increased seedling sexual recruitment (Table

 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Additionally, grazing decreased the proportion of asexual to sexual recruitment in the alpine meadows.
