<p class="p">In summary, our study added new evidence that global climate change has a positive impact on seedling species richness and density in alpine meadows. The floristic composition and the species diversity are largely determined by sexual seedling recruitment in an alpine community. Grazing changed the species composition and characteristics of the community, and the dominant functional groups changed from graminoids to forbs. Additionally, sexual recruitment plays an important role in community succession and regeneration in alpine grasslands. The findings suggest that global climate change and grazing can affect plant seedling diversity and density in alpine communities and potentially limit their ability to provide essential ecosystem functions and services for human well‚Äêbeing. Future studies need to continue exploring the dynamics of seedling mechanisms based on monitoring climate change and grazing.</p>
