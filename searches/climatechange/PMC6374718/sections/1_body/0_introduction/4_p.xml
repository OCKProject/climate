<p class="p">Plant recruitment in grasslands by way of sexual or asexual reproduction mainly depends on the species and environmental conditions and plays a critical role in the renewal and succession of the vegetation community (Tilman, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). The plant recruitment process refers to the whole growth stage from seed or vegetative organs to standing vegetation. Sexual recruitment has several advantages in genetic variability, seed production, and potential population expansion; however, asexual recruitment can typically maintain the original characteristics of the female parent in the breeding process, which will not generally cause mutations (Nathan &amp; Muller‐Landau, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). In the alpine grassland, sexual recruitment is influenced by the seed characteristics, disturbances, and soil. The alpine environmental factors constrain seed production and reduce the growth and survival rates of seedlings due to the short and cold growing season (Chambers, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Asexual reproduction is the dominant regenerative strategy for plants adapting to cold environments, and it is also the most basic feature of plants in alpine grasslands. Alpine plants have a low rate of seedling establishment from seeds; thus, asexual recruitment plays a crucial role in assuring population growth and stability in severely cold areas (Vera, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). This is not, of course, to say that sexual reproduction is unimportant; sexual reproduction can allow rare dispersal events with seeds, which is also important for alpine species to extend their distribution areas or to migrate to a new habitat. Sexual and asexual recruitment may have different major contributions to the genomic structure and population colonization (Kleunen, Fischer, &amp; Schmid, 
 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>).
