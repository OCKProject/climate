<p class="p">To compare the responses of sexual and asexual recruitment to climate change and grazing disturbance in the region, we studied seedling regeneration in warm and grazed alpine grasslands on the Tibetan Plateau. The objectives of this study were to (a) assess the effects of climate change and grazing disturbance on the diversity and quantification of sexual and asexual recruitment and (b) explore the responses of seedling recruitment of different functional groups to climate change and grazing disturbance in the alpine grassland community. This study may improve our understanding of the natural seedling recruitment and the potential direction of succession under climate change and grazing disturbance in the alpine grasslands of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
