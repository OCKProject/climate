<p class="p">In this experiment, the Shapiro‐Wilk test and Levene's test were used for testing residual normality, linearity, and homogeneity of variance. Two‐way ANOVA was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects of warming and grazing on seedling richness, seedling density, and plant functional groups. Tukey's HSD (Honest Significant Difference) was used for post hoc comparisons. The least significant difference was applied to separate means at the 5% significance level. All data analyses were performed with the SPSS statistical software package for Windows (version 19.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p>
