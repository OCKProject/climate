<p class="p">Along a slope, two 50 × 50‐m flat and uniform plots were selected at altitudes of 3,245 m and 3,045 m. Ten randomly selected vegetation‐intact soil blocks (60 × 60 cm, 40 cm deep, including a 50 × 50‐cm quadrat and a 10‐cm‐wide isolation strip) were excavated from the plot at 3,245 m and transferred to the plot at 3,045 m when the soil was slightly frozen in late October 2015. The translocation method caused only minimal damage to the plant roots, as 85% of the root biomass occurred in the upper 10‐cm soil layer (Wang &amp; Shi,

 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). A total of ten 50 × 50‐cm quadrats were randomly established in the plot at 3,245 m, five of them were fenced, and the remaining five were used for grazing in 2016. Similarly, ten transferred quadrats were randomly distributed in the plot at 3,045 m, five of them were fenced, and the remaining five were used for grazing. The average distance between the quadrats is about 5 m. In order to prevent the introduction of the surrounding vegetation seeds, we occasionally clipping the vegetation within a 5 m range of the transferred quadrats. Thus, two factors (warming and grazing) resulting four treatments in our study, no warming or grazing (control, C), grazing (G), warming (W), and warming combined with grazing (W × G), respectively. Each treatment had five replicates, and all quadrats were randomly distributed in the two plots.
