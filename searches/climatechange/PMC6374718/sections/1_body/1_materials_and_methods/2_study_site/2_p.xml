<p class="p">This study was conducted in alpine meadows at 3,000 m a.s.l. in the northeast margin of the Tibetan Plateau in Tianzhu alpine grassland (37°12'N, 102°43'E) in Gansu Province, China (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). The average daily air temperature is −0.1°C, ranging from −18.3°C in January to 12.7°C in July. The annual sum of the positive average daily temperature is 1,380°C. The total average annual precipitation is 425 mm, which is concentrated in July, August, and September. This region has a typical continental plateau climate characterized by a long and cold winter, short and mild summer, and no frost‐free period. The plant growth period is 120–140 days. The main soil type of the region is alpine meadow soil, and the vegetation is dominated by
