<p class="p">There are eight meteorological stations around the study site, that is, Qilian, Yongchang, Wuwei, Gangcha, Menyuan, Wushaoling, Xining, and Minhe (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). We obtained the altitude and average annual temperature at these meteorological stations for 2012, 2013, and 2014 from the National Meteorological Information Center of China (

Regression analysis detected a negative relationship between altitude and mean annual air temperature, and altitude is the main factor that affects air temperature in the area; the average air temperature elevation gradient is 0.57°C per 100 m (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34799-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). This finding is consistent with previous reports in the region (Meng et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). In this way, the air temperature decreased by approximately 1.14°C from 3,045 m to 3,245 m in the study site.
