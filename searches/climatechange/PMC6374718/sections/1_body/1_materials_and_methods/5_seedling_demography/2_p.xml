<p class="p">Generally, sexual recruitment was produced by seedlings and asexual recruitment by tillers or ramets according to Harper (

 <xref rid="ece34799-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In early June 2017, seedling species diversity and density were calculated. Seedling species diversity is expressed by the number of species per quadrat, and the seedling density is represented by the plant number per m

Much attention was paid to differentiate the uniform rounded morphology shown by sexual recruits from the smaller irregular morphology shown by asexual recruits. The classification of plant functional groups according to their ecological characteristics and economic value was as follows: the graminoid functional group included the main species of the Gramineae and Cyperaceae families, the legume functional group included the main species of the Leguminosae family, and the forb functional group included the other species except for those from the Cyperaceae, Gramineae, and Leguminosae families in the community (Tilman
