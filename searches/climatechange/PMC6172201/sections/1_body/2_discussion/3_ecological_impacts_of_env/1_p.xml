<p id="Par20" class="p">Under climate change, our results show that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase at a potentially accelerating pace over time. This will promote the homogenization of the world, with equator-like conditions spreading geographically to higher latitudes and leading to concomitant changes in the composition of ecological communities

 </sup>. This is expected to lead to greater spatial and temporal homogeneity (i.e., due to increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature).
