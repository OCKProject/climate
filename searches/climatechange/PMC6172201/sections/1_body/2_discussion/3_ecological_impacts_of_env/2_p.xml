<p id="Par21" class="p">The ecological consequences of increased homogeneity in the environment have been documented in a number of studies. Increased spatial and temporal homogeneity in environmental variables has been linked to increased extinction risk in populations

 </sup>. Increased temporal autocorrelation has been shown to promote extinction risk in red-shifted, slow growing species that do not exhibit overcompensatory density-dependence or high sensitivity to environmental stochasticity

 </sup>. Indeed, under prolonged exposure to poor environmental conditions, these slow-growing and red-shifted species will see their numbers dwindle and will thus be unable to recover fast enough when conditions improve. Hence, increasing the extent of poor environmental conditions by increasing temporal autocorrelation will erode temporal refugia and prevent temporal rescue effects. Since most animal populations appear to be red-shifted

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>, extinction risk is likely to rise due to the increased temporal autocorrelation of temperature under climate change.
