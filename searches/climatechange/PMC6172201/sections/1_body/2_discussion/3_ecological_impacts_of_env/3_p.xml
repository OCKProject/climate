 </sup>. Overall, the simultaneous erosion of temporal and spatial refugia under climate change has the potential to promote extinction risk. Mitigating the impacts of these trends in the spatiotemporal properties of temperature is thus critical in order ensure the persistence of complex and interconnected ecosystems in an increasingly homogeneous world.
