<p id="Par14" class="p">Despite substantial variability across the 21 climate models examined, the multimodel mean showed consistent, statistically significant increases in spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature at global and regional scales under climate change. Breakpoint analysis of the spatial range of temperature data over time indicated that there was a threshold response in spatial autocorrelation around year 2030 globally and around year 1950 in temperate regions. Furthermore, robustness of the increasing trend and agreement between individual models increased after the breakpoint for spatial autocorrelation globally. Overall, this suggests that the spatial and temporal autocorrelation of temperature are expected to increase under climate change, particularly during the second half of the 21
