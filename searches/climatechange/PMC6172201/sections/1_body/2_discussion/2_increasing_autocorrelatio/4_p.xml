<p id="Par18" class="p">Overall, GCM projections suggest that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature will tend to increase more on land than in the sea, with increases occurring in Eurasia, South America, western North America and southeastern Asia, and decreases occurring mostly in the Southern Ocean. This is intriguing because previous studies have shown that the temporal autocorrelation of temperature tends to be lower on land than in the sea

 </sup> because heat transfer occurs over longer timescales in the ocean and thus results in greater system “memory”. Taken together, these results suggest that the disparities in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature between land and sea are predicted to decrease over time at the global scale under climate change.
