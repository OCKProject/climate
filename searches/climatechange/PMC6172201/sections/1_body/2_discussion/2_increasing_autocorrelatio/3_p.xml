<p id="Par17" class="p">We suggest that discrepancies between model projections and observational data are more likely due to the large regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation trends seen in both observational studies and GCM projections (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, the analysis of weather data from 1910 to 1990 cited earlier revealed significant regional differences in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature, with Asia and Australia experiencing a significant increase over time, but South America and North America experiencing a significant decrease

 </sup>. Hence, differences in the spatial extent and resolution of observational studies vs. GCM projections could easily lead to conflicting conclusions due to the high degree of regional variation in these trends. Overall, understanding how the nature, resolution and spatiotemporal extent of temperature records interact to influence this discrepancy will be critical in order to more accurately predict the impact of climate change across temporal and spatial scales. Our GCM results echo those of Dillon

 </sup> and Wang and Dillon

 </sup>, who showed an increase in temporal autocorrelation of historical (observed) temperature data from 1961 to 1990 and an increase in spatial homogeneity in weather data between 1960 and 1991. This agreement between our results based on GCM projections and those of Dillon based on observations is consistent with the notion that differences in the spatial resolution and the spatiotemporal extent rather than the nature of the temperature records may have the greatest impact on estimates of temporal and spatial autocorrelation.
