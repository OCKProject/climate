<p id="Par19" class="p">Differences in the spatial autocorrelation of temperature in tropical vs. temperate regions are consistent with expectations from the physical characteristics of the regions. The significant difference between temperate and tropical regions in the mean scale of spatial autocorrelation (i.e., spatial range) is expected because the tropics are much smaller in area than the temperate regions. There is clear evidence of nonlinearity in the spatial data analyzed, particularly in the spatial range of global temperature. Our exploration of the nonlinearities in the global trends via piecewise regression revealed the presence of a quasi-universal breakpoint around the year 2030 across climate models, after which the spatial autocorrelation of temperature increased significantly over time. This lends support for the existence of a “tipping point” in the effect of carbon emissions on the spatial structure of temperature, with time acting as a proxy

 </sup>. Although the tipping point in the spatial range occurred around year 2030 in tropical regions, our analyses suggest that in temperate regions the threshold occurred during the 20
