<p id="Par16" class="p">For instance, GCMs are simulated at relatively coarse resolutions, are global in scale, longer term, and do not include all of the stochastic factors that influence temperature across temporal and spatial scales. Hence, GCM projections may exhibit an upward bias in the predicted temporal and spatial autocorrelation of temperature relative to observational studies due to the “spatiotemporal smoothing effect” created by their coarser resolution and limited sources of local stochasticity. Although these differences can make comparisons between raw predictions and observations difficult without some form of statistical correction, they should not affect the likelihood of detecting spatiotemporal trends in temperature autocorrelation within GCMs since these trends are measured by making internal comparisons of model predictions.</p>
