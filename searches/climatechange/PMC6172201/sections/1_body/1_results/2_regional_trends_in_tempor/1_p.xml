<p id="Par9" class="p">Although the temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases at the global scale, there is significant geographical variation in both the sign and the strength of the trend (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Temporal autocorrelation in temperature increases most on land in northwestern North America, central South America, northwestern Eurasia, and North and central Africa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). Temporal autocorrelation also increases in the ocean, mostly in the central and southern Atlantic Ocean, the southern Indian Ocean, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. However, temporal autocorrelation decreases almost uniformly across the entire Southern Ocean and West Africa (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a,b</xref>). Overall, these temporal trends in autocorrelation lead to changes of up to 0.2 units in the spectral exponent from 1870 to 2099 (Fig.
