<p id="Par10" class="p">There are no consistent differences in the percentage of geographical locations exhibiting increased vs. decreased temporal autocorrelation of temperature across longitudes. However, there are strong latitudinal patterns, with autocorrelation decreasing most between 70 S and 40 S due to the influence of the Southern Ocean. Autocorrelation increases most in temperate regions due to the effects of both land and sea. In general, model agreement is relatively high across most of the globe, with the notable exceptions of parts of Antarctica and the north Atlantic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). Model robustness is notably the highest in the Southern Ocean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). However, robustness is below 50% at other latitudes despite high agreement, which indicates that while individual GCMs are consistent in the trend, there is disagreement about the significance of the trend. Although there is no meaningful change in model agreement and robustness across longitudes, model agreement and robustness vary latitudinally reaching lower values around the South Pole, the equator and the North Pole.
