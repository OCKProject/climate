<p id="Par11" class="p">It is important to note that these results are based on the linearly detrended data, which retain seasonal temperature cycles. To determine the robustness of our results to seasonality, we conducted the same analyses on seasonally detrended data (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The results from the seasonally detrended data show an almost universal increase in temporal autocorrelation of temperature across the globe, particularly in the Pacific Ocean, the northern Atlantic Ocean, western North America, South America, western Africa and Australia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Overall, the predicted trends in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature are stronger and more spatially-uniform when seasonal temperature cycles are removed. This is because seasonal (annual) temperature fluctuations are characterized by high power and occur at relatively low frequencies when using multi-year time windows. Hence, when regressing (log) power against (log) frequency, annual fluctuations in temperature have high statistical leverage on the slope estimate used to quantify the spectral exponent. Removing seasonality, which remains relatively constant over time and has high leverage on the spectral exponent estimate, thus facilitates the detection of temporal trends in autocorrelation due to changes in temperature fluctuations occurring at non-annual frequencies. One can thus think of the trends obtained using the linearly detrended data as a conservative estimate of the expected changes in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature and those obtained using the seasonally detrended data as anti-conservative.
