<p id="Par8" class="p">The spectral exponent of the global temperature obtained from the climate multimodel mean becomes more negative over time (“reddening”) indicating increased temporal autocorrelation (Fig.

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>) and sign (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) across multiple time windows ranging from 5 to 10 years. Multiple individual climate models predict a similar increase in the temporal autocorrelation of temperature over time, yielding relatively high model agreement across time windows (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). However, model robustness remains relatively low due to disagreements over the significance of the temporal trend (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). There was no evidence of a breakpoint in the spectral exponent across time windows, indicating a constant rate of increase in temporal autocorrelation over time.
