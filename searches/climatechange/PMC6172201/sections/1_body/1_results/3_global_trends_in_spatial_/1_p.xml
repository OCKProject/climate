<p id="Par12" class="p">Spatial autocorrelation in the global multimodel mean temperature measured via the spatial range does not increase significantly over time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Although the slope relating the spatial range to time is consistently positive across all time windows, it is never significant (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Among individual climate models, the majority show an increase in the spatial range over time across all time windows, and the trend is robust across 30–60% of individual climate models depending on the time window (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Despite the lack of a significant relationship at the global scale, piecewise regression shows that across all time windows, there is a breakpoint in the regression of the spatial range against time around year 2030 after which the trend becomes universally significant and positive (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). After the second breakpoint, robustness of the trend in spatial range also increases across all time windows (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Hence, there is evidence that the spatial autocorrelation of temperature at the global scale is increasing over time after year 2030.
