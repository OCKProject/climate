<p id="Par13" class="p">Spatial autocorrelation in temperature is increasing significantly in temperate (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) and tropical (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value &lt; 0.05) regions over time in the climate multimodel mean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Across individual climate models, there is strong agreement on the direction of the trend in both temperate and tropical regions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Additionally, the trend is highly robust (&gt;90% of individual models) in temperate regions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Although spatial autocorrelation is significantly higher in temperate regions than in the tropics, it is increasing at the same rate in both regions (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The breakpoint in the regression of spatial range against time in the multimodel mean for temperate regions is around 1950, while the breakpoint in tropical regions is around year 2025 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
