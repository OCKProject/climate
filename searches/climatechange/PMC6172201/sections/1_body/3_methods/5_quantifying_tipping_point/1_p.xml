 </sup>. This was done using the R package ‘strucchange’, which uses a non-parametric method to estimate the response function and its derivatives, and how that response function changes across the range of the explanatory variable (i.e., time in this case; 44). Function ‘breakpoints’ was used to determine breakpoints in spatial and temporal trends, which identifies the change point by fitting degree 1 splines (piecewise linear functions) with zero through five knot points (change or breakpoint linking the two piecewise functions) of unknown locations
