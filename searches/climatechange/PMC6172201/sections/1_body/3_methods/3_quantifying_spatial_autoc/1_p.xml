<p id="Par26" class="p">The spatial autocorrelation of temperature over each time period was determined using (semi)variograms to estimate the spatial range, which corresponds to the lag distance (measured in kilometers) at which the semivariance of temperature begins to plateau. By quantifying the geographical distance at which temperatures become uncorrelated, the spatial range can thus be used to represent the spatial scale of autocorrelation. The spatial range was estimated by fitting a Gaussian model to the empirical variogram

 </sup>. We also computed the spatial range of temperature in the tropics (23.5°S to 23.5°N) vs. temperate regions (66°S to 23.5°S and 23.5°N to 66°N) and regressed them against time in order to determine whether there were any regional differences in the temporal trends of spatial autocorrelation.
