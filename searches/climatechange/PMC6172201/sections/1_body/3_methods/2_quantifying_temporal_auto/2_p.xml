<p id="Par25" class="p">To determine the robustness of our results to seasonal variability, we also performed spectral analysis on the seasonally detrended data. To do so, we computed the within-year temperature profile at each geographical location by averaging daily temperatures across the entire time series. We then subtracted the average within-year temperature profile from the daily temperatures at each corresponding geographical location to obtain the seasonally detrended data

 </sup>. Although there were some predictable quantitative differences between the spectral analysis results obtained from the seasonally detrended vs. linearly detrended data, which we discussed at length in the results section, the overall qualitative trends remained largely the same.
