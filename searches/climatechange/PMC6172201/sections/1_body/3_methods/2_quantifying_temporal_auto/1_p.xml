<p id="Par24" class="p">The temporal autocorrelation of daily temperature from each model was determined by calculating the spectral exponent. Daily temperature over the entire time period of the model was linearly interpolated at each geographical location to fill in the gaps for models with missing values due to leap years. The interpolated temperature values were then linearly detrended prior to analysis by extracting the residuals from a simple regression relating daily temperature to time at each geographical location over the entire time series. Spectral analysis was then conducted using periodograms computed via fast Fourier transforms in order to determine the variability (power) associated with each frequency in the interpolated and linearly detrended temperature time series
