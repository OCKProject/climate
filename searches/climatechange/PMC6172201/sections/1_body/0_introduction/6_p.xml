<p id="Par7" class="p">We found that temporal and spatial autocorrelation increased over time in individual climate models and the multimodel mean. However, there was considerable regional variation in temporal autocorrelation, with western North America, central South America, northwestern Eurasia and North Africa seeing significant increases in temporal autocorrelation, but West Africa and the Southern Ocean seeing significant decreases in temporal autocorrelation. Piecewise regression analyses showed consistent breakpoints in spatial trends in autocorrelation around the year 2030 globally, and spatial trends in autocorrelation were statistically significant after the breakpoint across time windows of different sizes. Our results suggest that climate change is likely to increase the spatial and temporal homogeneity of temperature, which may negatively impact connectivity between source and sink populations and thus reduce the persistence of ecological communities.</p>
