Quantifying such changes in the temporal autocorrelation of environmental variables is critical in order to accurately predict the dynamics and persistence of ecological systems under climate change. Indeed, increased temporal autocorrelation in climate variables has been linked to lower persistence of model and natural populations

 </sup>. In general, theory predicts that a reddening of environmental time series (an increase in its temporal autocorrelation) can extend the duration of poor conditions and thus promote extinction risk by eroding temporal refugia or rescue effects
