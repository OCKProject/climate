<p id="Par5" class="p">The link between spatial autocorrelation of the environment and population dynamics has also been well established, with theoretical and empirical studies showing that spatiotemporally correlated or synchronized fluctuations in environmental conditions can give rise to synchronized fluctuations in ecological populations (i.e., the Moran effect

 </sup>). For instance, increased spatial synchrony in air temperature due to changes in basin-scale climate forcing (North Atlantic Oscillation) gave rise to increased synchrony in Greenland animal populations

 </sup>. In general, increased spatial autocorrelation in the environment is expected to promote the scale and the magnitude of synchronized fluctuations in populations and thus reduce the spatial heterogeneity of ecological systems. In doing so, increased spatial environmental autocorrelation can thus promote extinction risk at local and regional scales by eliminating the potential for spatial rescue effects between interconnected but increasingly synchronized populations
