<p id="Par6" class="p">Although the negative effects of spatial and temporal autocorrelation have been established independently in model and natural systems, little is known about how these two phenomena will interact under climate change. Overall, theory suggests that increased spatial and temporal autocorrelation of environmental factors like temperature are expected to interact synergistically to destabilize ecological communities by disrupting both temporal and spatial rescue effects

 </sup>. To determine the potential for such synergistic interactions, we characterized spatial and temporal autocorrelation in temperature from climate model projections. This was accomplished by analyzing temperature data from 1871 to 2099 using spectral analysis to measure temporal autocorrelation by calculating the spectral exponent and estimating spatial autocorrelation by determining the lag distance at which temperature becomes spatially uncorrelated (i.e., the spatial range).
