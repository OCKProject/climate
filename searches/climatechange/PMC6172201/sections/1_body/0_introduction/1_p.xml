<p id="Par2" class="p">Although classical studies have focused almost exclusively on determining the ecological impacts of shifting average environmental conditions, there is growing recognition that statistical properties beyond the mean can play an equally important role in shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems under climate change

 </sup>. For instance, high variance in an environmental variable can destabilize populations by inducing greater fluctuations in their abundance over time and thus increase the risk of stochastic extinction

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. Even when environmental variance is too weak to promote extinction risk, it can have a more insidious effect on ecological systems due to nonlinear averaging. Specifically, if a population responds nonlinearly to environmental conditions, then changes in the temporal or spatial properties of the environment (e.g., temporal or spatial variance) can alter the mean ecological response even if the mean environmental conditions remain constant, and the strength of this effect will depend on the degree of nonlinearity in the functional response of the population

 </sup>. Hence, in order to determine how climate change will impact ecological systems, it is at least as important to study variation in temperature and other critical environmental variables as it is to study their mean.
