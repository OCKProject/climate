<p id="Par4" class="p">The combination of increased temporal variance and autocorrelation in the environment could have even more dire consequences for ecological systems. For example, Dillon 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. showed that adding power to lower frequencies of temperature time series increased their temporal variance and autocorrelation, and thus the overall incidence and persistence of long-term heat waves and cold snaps

 </sup>. Such increased intensity (temporal variance) and duration (temporal autocorrelation) of harsh conditions can promote extinction risk. Hence, the destabilizing effect of increased temporal environmental variability can be amplified by an increase in its autocorrelation. Overall, this suggests that increased temporal variance and autocorrelation of environmental conditions may interact synergistically to destabilize ecological systems.
