  <p class="p">Spatial autocorrelation of the multimodel mean temperature from 21 GCMs, averaged regionally over 10-year time windws. Spatial autocorrelation was quantified via the spatial range, which measures the geographical distance at which temperatures become decorrelated. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Changes in the spatial range for tropical geographical locations (23.5°S to 23.5°N). (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Changes in the spatial range for temperate geographical locations (23.5°N to 66°N and 66°S to 23.5°S). Trend lines reflect linear model fits obtained via Generalized Least Squares and shaded regions represent 95% confidence bands. Solid lines indicate statistically significant trends, and separate line segments and colors are used to show the breakpoints in the time series.
