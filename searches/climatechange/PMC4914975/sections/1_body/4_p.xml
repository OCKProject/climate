<p class="p">Whether or not mosquitoes were infected with

 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> infection in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambaie</italic> increased mosquito survival at extreme ambient temperatures relative to bloodfed controls. In contrast, 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> infection significantly decreased

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Table S5</xref>). The species-specific effects of ambient temperature and DTR on mosquito survival illustrate complex ‘mosquito x environment’ interactions, which might partially explain the mixed evidence for fitness effects of malaria infection on mosquitoes, with the majority of studies reporting negative or no effects reviewed in
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, and only one reporting positive effects of infection on mosquito survival
