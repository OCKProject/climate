 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>, suggesting that effects of exposure to high temperatures tend to be conserved at the species level. This premise is supported by the fact that our two mosquito species did not exhibit identical responses to high temperatures, even though they have been under similar lab-based selection for many generations. Thus, we expect variation in temperature above the optimum to yield reductions in transmission potential irrespective of local adaptation. The more general caution regarding extrapolation of lab-based results to field settings is important to acknowledge. However, data on the effects of temperature on malaria mosquito and parasite traits are surprisingly scant. For example, the best available data to describe the relationship between vector competence and temperature
