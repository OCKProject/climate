<p class="p">At a more basic level, our data emphasize the importance of local environmental context for understanding temporal and spatial patterns of transmission. We demonstrate multi-fold-differences in malaria transmission potential due to small changes in mean temperature and DTR. Transient shifts of ±3 °C or more in mean temperature and DTR are commonplace (

We also demonstrate important differences between vector species in thermal sensitivity of life history traits and overall vector competence, cautioning against the use of mixed-species data and extrapolation across vector-parasite pairings, which is a common feature of many studies exploring environmental influences on transmission
