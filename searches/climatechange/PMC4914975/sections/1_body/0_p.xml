<p class="p">The dynamics and distribution of human malaria strongly depend on the interplay between the parasite, the mosquito vectors and the environment
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. The key parasite and mosquito life history traits that determine transmission intensity exhibit clear, non-linear relationships with temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. This non-linearity means that small changes in environmental temperature can lead to large changes in transmission risk. Recent evidence suggests that malaria incidence is increasing in cooler regions of the world due to global warming

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>, and the implications for malaria risk in optimum transmission settings remain poorly defined. Additionally, irrespective of climate change, mosquitoes are exposed to a range of microclimates due to variation in local habitat features, which affect mean ambient temperature and diurnal temperature range (DTR)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Here we investigate how shifts in temperature around optimum conditions representative of endemic transmission settings, affects the capacity of two key vector species -
