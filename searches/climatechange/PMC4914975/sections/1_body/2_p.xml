<p class="p">For both 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>, increases in mean ambient temperature resulted in significant decreases in oocyst prevalence, oocyst intensity, and sporozoite prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S1</xref>). These results suggest that mean temperatures above 27 °C are less permissive for parasite establishment and development. The effects of warmer temperatures on vector competence were much more pronounced in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> than in 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>. The effect of varying DTR was mixed and, again, dependent on vector species. For example, increasing DTR had a marginally significant effect on oocyst prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>), and no effect on oocyst intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1C</xref>) or sporozoite prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1E</xref>) in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>, increasing diurnal temperature fluctuation also significantly reduced oocyst prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>) and intensity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S2</xref>). However, the effect of DTR on oocyst intensity only occurred when 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> were housed at a mean 27 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1D</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S2</xref>). Unexpectedly, the impact of DTR on sporozoite prevalence was marginally non-significant, despite effects of variation in DTR on oocyst establishment in 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1F</xref>).
