<p class="p">We demonstrate that relatively small increases in mean temperature and diurnal temperature range around the temperature optimum can both lead to marked reductions in vectorial capacity. For example, an increase of 3 °C from a highly permissive temperature of 27 °C reduced vectorial capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> by 51–66%. For 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> the effects were even greater, with vectorial capacity reduced by as much as 84–89%, depending on DTR. This also means that a decrease in temperature from 30 to 27 °C (as might occur seasonally) could increase transmission potential by 629–814%, depending on DTR. Furthermore, increases in DTR alone could halve vectorial capacity. The effects of DTR are highly relevant to ongoing changes in housing design that are taking place in many parts of Africa
