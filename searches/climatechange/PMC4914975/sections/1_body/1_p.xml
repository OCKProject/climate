<p class="p">To examine the effects of temperature on vectorial capacity, we provided female mosquitoes with either an uninfected or 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic>-infectious bloodmeal and then randomly placed them across three mean temperatures. These mean temperatures were 27 °C, representing conditions typically considered optimal for mosquito and parasite development, and 30 and 33 °C, representing warmer environments within the current transmission range and/or future environments after projected climate warming
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. We also included three diurnal temperature ranges (DTR of 0, 6 and 9 °C) for each mean temperature, because temperatures are not constant in nature and daily cycles in temperature can shape insect and parasite life history traits beyond the effect of mean temperature alone

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>. We then quantified the effects of mean ambient temperature and DTR on measures of vector competence, such as parasite prevalence at different developmental stages (proportion of mosquitoes with oocysts or sporozoites) and parasite intensity (number of oocysts/midgut), as well as daily mosquito survival. To assess the effects of variation in mean temperature and DTR on overall transmission risk, we used these data to estimate changes in vectorial capacity, a standard metric used to define the transmission potential of a vector population.
