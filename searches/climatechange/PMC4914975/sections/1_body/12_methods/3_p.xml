<p class="p">All statistical analyses for these experiments were run in IBM SPSS Statistics 22.0 (IBM Corporation). We used mixed effects generalized linear models to assess the effects of temperature, diurnal temperature range, and infection treatment on the following response variables: oocyst prevalence, oocyst intensity, sporozoite prevalence, and daily mosquito survival. Temperature (27 °C, 30 °C, and 33 °C), diurnal temperature range (DTR 0 °C, DTR 6 °C, and DTR 9 °C), and their interaction were included in all models as fixed effects. Infection treatment (bloodfed control and 
 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> infected) and days post-infection were included in all survival models as an additional fixed effect and a covariate, respectively. To control for any variation influencing our response variables across biological replicates, we included replicate as a random factor in all model analyses (
