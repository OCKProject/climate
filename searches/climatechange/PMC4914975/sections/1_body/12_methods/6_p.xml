 <italic class="italic">m</italic>) was estimated by taking the average number of mosquitoes alive in each treatment group upon completion of the parasite’s extrinsic incubation period at each temperature. Due to significant block effects, we used estimated marginal means from our mixed model analysis to parameterize vector competence (
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>; the proportion of infectious mosquitoes), and the daily probability of mortality of potentially infectious adult mosquitoes (
