 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, and we used the Parton-Logan model for diurnal temperature fluctuation (

 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> exposed treatment group to quantify the effects of variation in mean temperature, diurnal temperature fluctuation, and treatment on measures of vector competence (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Methods</xref>). Throughout the duration of the experiment we counted the number of dead mosquitoes in each cage daily to quantify the effects of mean temperature, diurnal temperature fluctuation, and treatment on daily mosquito mortality.
