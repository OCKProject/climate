<p class="p">Increasing mean ambient temperatures significantly reduced daily mosquito survival for both 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> and

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), and these effects were again more marked in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambaie</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic> experienced higher daily survival across all treatment groups throughout the course of each experiment relative to 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). There were also significant main effects of variation in DTR on adult longevity (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S3</xref>); however, the effect was dependent upon mean ambient temperature (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S3</xref>) and was qualitatively different for each vector species (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">SI Table S4</xref>). For example, in 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic>, modest diurnal temperature fluctuation (DTR 6 °C) around the hottest mean temperature (33 °C) buffered mosquitoes from the effects of hot mean temperatures on daily mosquito survival, while more extreme temperature fluctuation (DTR 9 °C) exacerbates these effects relative to mosquitoes housed in a thermally constant, hot environment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). In 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>, diurnal temperature fluctuation in general decreased daily mosquito survival only in mosquitoes housed at a mean 27 °C (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>).
