<p class="p">In our experiments, mosquito larvae were maintained under standard insectary conditions before being transferred to the different temperature treatments as adults. This approach reflects the fact that temperatures in natural larval habitats can differ substantially from ambient air temperatures experienced by adult mosquitoes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, and that adults emerging from a common larval habitat can potentially distribute across diverse local microclimates
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. Nonetheless, we acknowledge that temperature variation can also impact larval life history traits
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>, and that temperature effects can integrate across life stages, potentially exacerbating the impact of climate warming
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. How such effects play out in the field could be further shaped by variations in biotic factors

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>). Transmission intensity and ultimately disease burden are also strongly determined by rainfall, control measures and socio-economic factors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Even so, direct effects of temperature on mosquito life history and malaria parasites remain important determinants of disease risk
