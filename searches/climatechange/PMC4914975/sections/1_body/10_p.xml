The current study provides important empirical evidence to counterbalance this recurrent emphasis in the climate change literature. Based on data in the Malaria Atlas Project (

 <italic class="italic">P. falciparum</italic> parasite rates in the 2â€“10 year old age class &gt;40%). In high transmission settings, the epidemiology of malaria is complex, not least because prevalence exhibits a strongly non-linear, saturating relationship with measures of transmission intensity such as vectorial capacity or entomological inoculation rate

Nonetheless, changes in temperature due to modification of local landscape and housing, or longer-term climate change, could work in concert with control efforts and improvements in public health infrastructure to reduce malaria transmission in these highly endemic settings. Indeed, there is some evidence that this might already be occurring
