<p class="p">The effects of increasing mean ambient temperatures and DTR on individual vector-parasite traits translate into dramatic reductions in overall vectorial capacity for both 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">An. stephensi</italic>, with the impact most pronounced for 
 <italic class="italic">An. gambiae</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>). When rate summation was used to predict additional effects of DTR on the extrinsic incubation period of the parasite and daily mosquito biting rates, we see even further reductions in vectorial capacity in mosquitoes housed at all temperatures (
