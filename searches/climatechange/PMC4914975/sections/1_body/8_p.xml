<p class="p">The laboratory colonies of mosquitoes that we used are likely adapted to standard insectary temperatures of 25–27 °C, and the parasite strain has also been selected to infect optimally under these conditions. In nature, local adaptation could lead to different temperature optima, and different susceptibilities to temperature fluctuation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Such local adaptation could limit direct extrapolation of our results to field settings. However, there is scant information on the nature and extent of local adaptation in malaria vectors
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>, and mean temperatures of 25–27 °C are typical for areas with high endemic transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. One of the only studies to explore local thermal adaptation in a mosquito vector (in this case 
 <italic class="italic">Culex pipiens</italic>, a vector of certain arboviruses) found that although local populations differed in key life history traits such as development and survival, variation was not correlated with local temperatures and thus did not support the local thermal adaptation hypothesis
