Then, a distributed hydrologic model is used to obtain future inflow to the major reservoirs based on projections from the CMIP5 precipitation and temperature simulations. Projected water demand as well as water available from a local desalination plant are used to assess water stress in the projection period (2020–2035) relative to the baseline (1995–2010).
