<p id="Par7" class="p">We assess future climate change impacts on water resources in Melbourne Metropolitan area using climate change projections from 12 global models participating in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). Each model is subjected to a scenario of prescribed exponentially growing 21

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>) and by considering 17 different future water demand scenarios ranging from very optimistic to very unfavorable (see Methods Section and Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). These demand scenarios weight the effects of different assumptions of population, industrial and agricultural growth, and consumption behaviors. Our explicit consideration of water demand scenarios, involving a localized bottom-up accounting for human influence and local conditions, is a major advance from the conventional large-scale, top-down approach
