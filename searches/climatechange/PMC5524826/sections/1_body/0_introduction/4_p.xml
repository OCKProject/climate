<p id="Par5" class="p">We focus on the Melbourne metropolitan area in the southeast of Australia where most of the water for consumptive or industrial use comes from large reservoirs in protected areas (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). In this area reservoirs fundamentally change the distribution of water availability throughout the year to meet local human, industrial, agricultural and environmental water demand (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Most of the natural inflow occurs during July to October when water demand is relatively low. The water stored during this wet season is released in the summer when demand significantly exceeds inflow rates (compare the natural flow with the outflow of man-made reservoirs in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Thus, an accurate assessment of climate change impacts on water resources availability in this region requires explicit consideration of the dynamic human interactions

The water supply catchments for metropolitan area of Melbourne are a quintessential example of a highly-regulated water system, with a number of reservoirs that enhance local resilience and help the region cope with climatic extremes through water storage and redistribution (though the area is still vulnerable to climate change and variability)
