  <p class="p">Melbourne future water demand scenarios (see Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) and their corresponding projected reservoir water storage anomalies in 2020–2035 relative to the baseline (1995–2010). The blue-shaded boxplots indicate that optimistic future water demand scenarios (demand in the projection period would be less than the baseline), leading to more water storage in the projection period relative to the baseline. The green-shaded boxplots show scenarios in which future demand is more than the baseline, but the projected average storage anomalies still remain positive (i.e., despite increases in the future demand, because of the storage infrastructure, the system would not experience water stress worse than the baseline period which includes the Millennium Drought). The red-shaded boxplots exhibit scenarios that the future demand significantly exceeds that of the baseline and the projected average storage anomalies are negative under the RCP 8.5 climate projections (i.e., with the current storage capacity, considering both climatic change and future demand, the region would experience more water stress in the future relative to the baseline period).
