<p class="p">An analysis of variance with similarity to the original story as the dependent variable and Audience (4 levels: Control, Egalitarian, Hierarchist, Individualist), World View (3 levels: Individualism, Hierarchism, and Egalitarianism), and Time (2 levels: Stage 1, Stage 2) as independent variables was conducted; Audience was varied between-subjects, Time was varied within-subjects, and World View was measured and served as a quasi-experimental between-subjects factor
