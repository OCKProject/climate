<p id="Par12" class="p">In conclusion, our findings suggest that, assuming no changes in population and vulnerability and consistent with the thresholds agreed in Paris, lower increases in GMT would reduce temperature-related mortality in most regions of the world. As reported in the 5th IPCC assessment report (IPCC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>) and shown in the present study, the 2-°C long-term temperature goal should not be considered as “safe”, because warming at this level could still produce increments in mortality. However, conclusions on the additional benefits of an extra 0.5 °C decrease in GMT rise are not straightforward, with the comparison of 1.5 vs 2 °C affected by larger uncertainty and showing important geographical variability. Specifically, we found indications of a net increase in total mortality in cooler regions when restricting warming to 1.5 °C, due to the large component of cold-related mortality. In contrast, warmer areas could still experience a net decrease due to the relative rise in heat-related mortality. These patterns seem to follow a within-continent gradient according to the prevalent climate, with populations living in warmer areas, especially with equatorial climates, benefitting the most from stricter mitigation policies. Recent studies suggest that the direct consequences of climate change will be more visible in these tropical regions, not only in terms of increases in average temperature and a higher likelihood of more intense extreme-heat events, but also more frequent extreme weather episodes (i.e., droughts and floods) and more severe indirect effects (i.e., changes in crop yields) (Schleussner et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2017</xref>). In fact, these regions include the most populated areas worldwide and, in general, the most vulnerable to climate change, with a limited capacity for adaptation due to lack of infrastructural, financial, and technological resources (Smith et al.
