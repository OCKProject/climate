<p id="Par7" class="p">The pattern of results suggests an association between projected total temperature impacts and current climate conditions. This is particularly clear in Europe and Asia, where the impact of a change in temperature applied to the current population shows moderate decreases in excess mortality in the colder areas of the north, nearly null changes or small increases in the temperate central areas, and larger increases in warmer southern regions. This pattern is better illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> showing the geographical distribution of the location-specific estimates for the 2- vs 1.5-°C difference. We can also observe a within-country positive gradient from temperate to warmer or equatorial areas in Brazil, although this was not clear in other countries in Central America and USA; the results obtained by different climate zones confirm this gradient (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, bottom panel). Although imprecise, our projections indicate that locations in equatorial climates could experience a + 0.66% increase in total excess mortality from 1.5 to 2 °C warming, followed by a smaller + 0.16% increase in arid zones, while cooler regions (warm temperate and snow climates) could register a decrease or close-to-null change in total excess temperature-related mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>) based on the current population. Similarly, equatorial locations would be the most affected areas by far under more extreme scenarios, experiencing an increment in total mortality impacts above + 6% if GMT increases by 4 °C.
