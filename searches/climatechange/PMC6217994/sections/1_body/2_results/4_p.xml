 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref> shows the results from a sensitivity analysis in which we compare the GCM-specific and ensemble excess mortality estimated for each geographic area for 1.5-Â°C warming scenario. We observe little variation across models, thus confirming that impact calculation does not depend on the timing in which each GCM reach a specific warming level, and therefore on the choice of specific climate models or emission pathways.
