 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> illustrates the trends in differences in excess mortality by geographic region and climatic zone projected under other warming scenarios, including those beyond the Paris Agreement targets, corresponding to increases in GMT of 2, 3, and 4 °C, relative to 1.5 °C (figures in Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). As expected, we observed a common pattern of rising mortality associated with heat and a moderate attenuation in cold-related impacts. Under more extreme scenarios, most regions could experience considerably larger heat-mortality risks that would not be balanced by the projected decreases in cold-related excess mortality. Specifically, central and southern regions of America, Europe, and East-Asia are projected to experience increases in heat-related mortality impacts ranging between + 3.53 and + 8.86% in the most extreme 4-°C scenario, while cooler regions in Europe and Asia could face smaller increases below + 2%. In the latter regions, the contribution of the reduction in cold-related mortality impacts would be similar to the increase observed for heat, ranging between − 1.88 and − 2.23%, translating into small or even null and non-significant net reductions in total excess mortality. The most affected areas in terms of large increases in net temperature-mortality impacts would be again the warmest regions in the south of Europe and South-East-Asia (+ 4.41 and + 7.07%), and in a smaller magnitude in South America and Central Europe (+ 2.60 and + 2.63%). However, estimates on net changes are highly uncertain for most of the regions and warming levels, showing statistically significant results only for the central and southern European regions. A different pattern is observed for Australia, with negative net changes in excess mortality across the warming scenarios. This would be due to the milder temperature projections obtained for this region, compared to other areas of similar climate, as shown in Fig. S
