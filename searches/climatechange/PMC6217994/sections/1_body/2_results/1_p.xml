 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref>). Overall, an increase from 1.5 to 2 °C in GMT could generate a substantial rise in heat-related mortality in most countries included in the analysis. Specifically, assuming no changes in population and vulnerability, heat-mortality impacts could increase between + 0.11 and + 2.13%, with most countries in South Europe and South-East Asia showing increments above + 1%. In contrast, cold-related mortality could decrease in all countries between − 0.27 and − 0.98%. These decrements are of a lower magnitude compared to the corresponding heat-related risks, producing a net increase in excess mortality in about half of the countries but with large uncertainty in most of them. For instance, only Italy and Spain, the two countries in the South of Europe included in the study, could face a significant net increase in total excess temperature-related mortality of about + 0.66 and + 0.77%, respectively. Similar or larger but not statistically significant increases, reaching + 1.15%, could be observed in other warm countries in South-East Asia, such as the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam, despite having different climate conditions (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In contrast, total excess mortality could decrease in cooler areas such as North Europe and East Asia. For example, Ireland and Japan could register a small decrease between − 0.51 and − 0.27%. Other large countries (Canada, USA, and Chile), and some countries located in central areas such as Czech Republic and Moldova, might not face substantial changes in total excess mortality. However, many of the net change estimates are not statistically significant, reflecting the uncertainty in the estimates.
