<p id="Par10" class="p">Other interpretational issues should be also considered. For example, our projections are limited to the direct acute impact of heat and cold on mortality, and do not consider potentially larger impacts due to indirect pathways (e.g., sea-level rise or food production). Likewise, although the present study covers a large number of locations from different regions worldwide, it is not entirely representative of each geographic region or climate zone. For instance, temperature-related impacts in other warm regions such as Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, or other countries in South-East Asia such as India, were not explored due to the lack of observed temperature-mortality data. Indeed, these highly populated and mostly poor areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change, and it is expected that populations in these locations could suffer from more severe extreme heat events (Harrington et al.
