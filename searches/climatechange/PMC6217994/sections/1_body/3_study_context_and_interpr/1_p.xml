<p id="Par9" class="p">This study investigates the potential temperature-mortality impacts projected under specific climate change scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. Projections are presented as a function of GMT rise, instead of climate trajectories or emission scenarios as in previously published health impact assessments. Our approach is consistent with the framework of the Paris Agreement, which sets explicit temperature targets but does not define specific timelines or mitigation plans. It is therefore implicit that the same GMT rise can be reached under different development pathways and mitigation policies, as previously demonstrated (Seneviratne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2018</xref>). Coherently, impact estimates are likely to be largely independent from the choice of alternative GCM/RCP combinations to select the time slices corresponding to a specific GMT increase, as shown in our analysis (Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). While this framework offers a straightforward way to quantify target-related impacts, it does not permit the integration of other factors that are likely to modify future health burdens, such as demographic changes and adaptation strategies, as the timing and socio-economic pathways leading to the related GMT increases can vary. By contrast, the applied methodology is based on clear assumptions defining simplified scenarios of stable populations and no-adaptation. Although we acknowledge that these are unrealistic representations of plausible futures, these simplified scenarios facilitate the proper interpretation of the results, as the impact due to global warming can be disentangled from the contribution of other factors. Consistently, our estimates should not be considered predictions of future mortality, but projections of hypothetical health impacts based on current socio-economic conditions, population structure and level of vulnerability. While recognizing these limitations, findings from this study can serve as a basis in the ongoing discussions on the implementation of the Paris Agreement, and can be then extended and refined to assess more specific scenarios that take into account detailed mitigation strategies and underlying changes in baseline populations and temperature-related risks.
