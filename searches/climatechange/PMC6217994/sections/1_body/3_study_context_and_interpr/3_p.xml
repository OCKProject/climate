<p id="Par11" class="p">We applied an analytical framework based on advanced, established statistical techniques that enabled us to model complex temperature-mortality associations and project the corresponding impacts under clearly defined warming scenarios (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>). Specifically, these methods allow modeling non-linear and lagged epidemiological relationships, capturing geographical differences, and separating the contributions of cold and heat temperatures (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2015</xref>) (Supplementary Material 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). However, we also observe a large uncertainty in our estimates, particularly those for the net impacts and more extreme scenarios. The imprecision is attributed to variability in the climate models and to estimates of the exposure-response curves. In the latter, the uncertainty and potential biases generated in extrapolating the functions beyond the observed temperature range are not accounted for (Ebi and Rocklöv 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2014</xref>; Benmarhnia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the impact of such extrapolation is unlikely to be substantial, because on average only 1.7 and 3.2% of heat days temperature were above the maximum observed in each 1.5- and 2-°C scenario (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). Likewise, we should acknowledge that the results would likely be even less precise if other important sources of uncertainty, such as accounting for adaptation, were considered in the present analysis (Gosling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2017</xref>).
