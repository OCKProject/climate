<p id="Par2" class="p">The Paris Agreement, adopted in December 2015 under the auspices of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is a turning point in negotiations to limit the potential damages of climate change. An agreement was reached on an ambitious long-term goal to limit warming from pre-industrial levels “well below” a 2-°C increment in global mean temperature (GMT), and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 °C (UNFCCC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2015b</xref>). The UNFCCC invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to provide a special report in 2018 on the impacts of 1.5- vs. 2-°C warming, to determine the avoided impacts of further reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. This report will include multisectoral assessments of the regional-scale consequences for society and environment of different degrees of warming, with comprehensive evaluations of potential impacts. Non-optimal outdoor temperatures will be included in the assessment of impacts on human health (Seneviratne et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">2017</xref>). The majority of these studies focused on heat-related deaths, and did not consider cold-related mortality, which may be reduced as temperature continues to increase (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2016</xref>). Our recent multi-country health impact projection analysis, the largest of its kind, investigated trends in temperature-related mortality under various greenhouse gas (GHG) emission trajectories (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>). However, these studies offered little evidence on the comparative risks under warming scenarios based on specific GMT targets, such as those under the Paris Agreement. The present contribution addresses this research gap by assessing the excess mortality attributable to non-optimal temperature projected across various geographical and climate regions under climate change scenarios corresponding to 1.5 and 2 °C increases in GMT, and by comparing them with more extreme warming scenarios corresponding to 3 and 4 °C increases.
