 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>, and Supplementary Material S1). We applied a methodology developed in a previous study on trends in temperature-mortality projections performed within the same collaborative network (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>). Here in this section, we provide a brief description of this methodological framework. For a more detailed explanation on the different analytical steps, refer to the Supplementary Material S2 and to a previous work (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>). In brief, we firstly estimated the location-specific exposure-response relationship between observed daily temperature and mortality counts using historical data collected through the MCC Network. We then projected temperature-related excess mortality, using the modeled daily series of temperature and mortality, under scenarios consistent with 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 °C increases in GMT above pre-industrial levels, assuming no change in demographics or population vulnerability. Thus, results are expressed as function of specific warming levels, instead of calendar periods under specific emission pathways as done in the previous publication (Gasparrini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2017</xref>). These warming scenarios were defined using 20-year windows of modeled daily temperature within 1990–2099 corresponding to specific GMT increases. These “time-slices” were obtained from three global climate models (GCMs, specifically HadGEM2-ES (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>), IPSL-CM5A-LR (Mignot and Bony 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2013</xref>), and MIROC-ESM-CHEM (Watanabe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2011</xref>)) under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The combination of RCP8.5 and the three GCMs was selected to ensure a warming level of up to 4 °C in GMT over the current century. The time slices were identified in each GCM following a procedure detailed elsewhere (Schleussner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2016</xref>). See Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> for the specific periods, Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>, and Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> for the geographical distribution of the location-specific GMT increase from 1.5 to 2 °C and Fig. S
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for the overall GCM-ensemble trends. This time-slice approach is justified given that little evidence for scenario dependence was found for temperature-related indices and a warming of up to 4 °C (Seneviratne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2016</xref>; James et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2017</xref>). At the same time, by using location-specific series, we account for differential increases in temperature across geographical areas for each GMT scenario. Location-specific excess mortality, expressed in terms of attributable fractions for cold (below the minimum mortality temperature, MMT) and heat (above MMT), in each 20-year window were averaged across GCMs to obtain the corresponding ensemble estimate in each scenario (Gasparrini and Leone 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">2014</xref>).
