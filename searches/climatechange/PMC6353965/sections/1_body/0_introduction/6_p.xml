 </sup>, is to identify the conservation status and diversity patterns of the endemic mammal species in the Afro-Arabian region based on species distribution models (SDMs). Species distribution models allow for delineating species geographic and environmental niches through quantifying the relationships between their occurrences and associated biotic and abiotic variables, and allow for predicting species niches in unsampled regions
