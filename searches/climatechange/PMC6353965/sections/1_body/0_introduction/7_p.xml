<p id="Par11" class="p">We delineated the contemporary potential distribution ranges for the endemic mammal species of the Afro-Arabian region using SDMs. Then, based on the range maps derived from the SDMs, we defined the biodiversity hotspot areas in the study area. We then projected the current potential ranges temporally into 2050 and 2070 to predict the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of the endemic mammals in the future. According to the degree of predicted change in the speciesâ€™ ranges, we then assigned a threat category to each species following the IUCN Red List criterion A3(c).</p>
