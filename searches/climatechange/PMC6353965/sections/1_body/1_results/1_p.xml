<p id="Par12" class="p">We compiled data for 107 endemic mammal species belonging to 17 families (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The most represented families were Muridae (41 species), Soricidae (18 species), and Bovidae (16 species). All ensemble SDMs had a good predictive performance (True Skill Statistic (TSS) &gt; 0.49, mean = 0.80, SD = 0.09, and Area Under the Receiver Operator Curve (AUC) &gt; 0.74, mean = 0.89, SD = 0.05) suggesting that the SDMs were well capable to identify suitable areas within the study region (AUC &amp; TSS values for each species are listed in Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). The spatial analysis revealed that the contemporary species richness reaches a maximum of 35 endemic mammal species per ~25 km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>. The areas with the highest richness values were concentrated along the coast of the Mediterranean and Red sea, and around the mountainous regions. The areas with the lowest richness were found in central Algeria and Mauritania in the West and central Saudi Arabia in the East (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). It is noteworthy that the species richness showed a latitudinal gradient for endemic mammal species increasing northward.
