<p id="Par14" class="p">The impact of the projected climate change scenarios on the potential species distribution was not consistent and varied among the species, where some were predicted to reduce the size of their distribution ranges and become threatened, while other species were predicted to expand their distribution ranges and thus benefit from climate change. According to the No Dispersal scenario (ND), assuming that the species will not be able to occupy the projected suitable habitats, 17 and 22 species were predicted to go extinct (losing 100% of their suitable range) by 2050 and 2070 respectively. Under the same scenario, 84 and 87 species were predicted to lose more than 30% of their suitable ranges by 2050 and 2070 respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). In the unlimited dispersal scenario, the models predicted 15 and 22 species to go extinct by 2050 and 2070 respectively, while 15 species were predicted to expand their distribution ranges over that time (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The majority of the species at risk of going extinct were small mammals belonging to the family Soricidae (seven out of 21) and the family Muridae (ten out of 42). In general, about 80 endemic mammal species in the Afro-Arabian region will be likely to become severely threatened (losing 50–100% of their current potential suitable habitats) according to the projected climate change (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
