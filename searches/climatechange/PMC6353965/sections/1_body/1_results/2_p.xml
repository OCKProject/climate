<p id="Par13" class="p">Our results also revealed that both species richness and turnover showed significant temporal trends, where the projected change in climate conditions resulted in markedly reduced mammalian diversity in the study area. We found, under the Unlimited Dispersal scenario (UD) assuming that the species will be able to disperse freely to the projected suitable habitats, about 17% reduction in the species richness by 2050, increasing to 20% by 2070. Similarly, species turnover—the change in species composition over time— was predicted to increase steadily during the 21st century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The changes in species turnover were predicted to be higher particularly in the central Sahara and the western side of the Arabian Desert.
