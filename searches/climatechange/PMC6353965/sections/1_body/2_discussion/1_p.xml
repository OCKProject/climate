<p id="Par16" class="p">Based on the best available species distribution models, we examined how the projected climate change could influence the distribution and diversity patterns of endemic mammals in the Afro-Arabian region. Our results show that many of the endemic mammals are facing an extremely augmented risk of extinction in the immediate future (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). This result supports the findings of previous studies that have shown that a substantial number of vertebrate species globally are expected to become extinct in the next decade

 </sup>. This high extinction risk could be amplified by the influence of additional drivers such as changing land-use patterns, disease outbreaks, human pressure, and introduction of novel parasites or invasive species
