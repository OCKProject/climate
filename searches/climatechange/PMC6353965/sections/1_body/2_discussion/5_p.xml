 </sup>. This pattern could be attributed to factors such as palaeogeography and/or historical land-use patterns which complemented each other to form a mosaic of interconnected habitats, resulting in high species richness in the northern parts of the study area

 </sup>. Additionally, areas with high species richness are also geographic transition zones. For instance, the Sinai is a transitional habitat between Asia and Africa, while Morocco lies between Africa and Europe. These transition habitats are characterised by high levels of species diversity and endemism, and the occurrence of species with allopatric ranges
