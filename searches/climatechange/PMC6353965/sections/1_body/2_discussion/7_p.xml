 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This could be because the species assemblages in our study follow the hollow curve pattern, where most species have small distribution ranges with just a few large ones

The change in species composition reflected by high species turnover, due to species range contractions and expansions, as well as influx of new species and/or departure of other species, could negatively influence the existing species interaction patterns and the trophic network structure
