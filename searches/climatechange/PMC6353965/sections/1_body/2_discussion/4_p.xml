<p id="Par19" class="p">Our results show a high divergence between the current IUCN conservation status and the predicted status according to the projected change in the distribution range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This disagreement is owed to applying different criteria to assess species extinction. For instance, our assessment is based on the A3(c) criterion that assign species to a threat category according to the degree of change in species’ ranges. Other criteria use other factors (e.g., the size of distribution range, population status, number of sub-population, and threats severity) to assign species to a threat category. As such, species can be considered threatened according to a specific criterion and not threatened according to another. We acknowledge that SDMs do not identify the proximate causes of species extinction
