 </sup>. However, the political conflicts, particularly in the Sinai region, and the sprawling development along the coastal areas do not hold much promise for the survival of species in these regions. An accurate assessment of biodiversity and its threats is not available across the Afro-Arabian region because of its remoteness and political instability. However, the rate of hunting wildlife unsustainably substantially increased and several wildlife massacres have been reported particularly after the “Arab spring” in 2011
