<p id="Par18" class="p">For those species predicted to expand their climatically suitable ranges (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), it will be important to have a dispersal rate that conforms with the climatic velocity (i.e. the rate at which these species disperse should keep pace with the change in climate)

 </sup>. In the Afro-Arabian region, which is dominated by high climatic velocity, the species dispersal ability is either naturally low or artificially limited by habitat fragmentation. Furthermore, biotic interactions and the existence of natural and anthropogenic barriers further limit the species ability to expand or shift their distribution ranges
