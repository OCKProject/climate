 </sup>. For instance, the recruitment of 
 <italic class="italic">Acacia</italic> species, a keystone species in the Sahara and the Arabian Desert, increased with the presence of herbivore species (e.g. Dorcas gazelle 
 <italic class="italic">Gazella dorcas</italic>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>
 </sup>. Unlike other herbivorous species, Dorcas gazelles are known to be browsers and not grazers, which, in turn, allows the vegetation cover for the desert ecosystem to survive and persist, in addition they also act as plant seeds dispersers

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>
 </sup>. At the same time, the gazelles are the main prey for several predators (e.g. Cheetah 
 <italic class="italic">Acinonyx jubatus</italic> and Wolf 
 <italic class="italic">Canis lupus</italic>) that have suffered from decline in prey availability
