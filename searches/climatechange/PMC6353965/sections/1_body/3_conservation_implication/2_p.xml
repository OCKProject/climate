 </sup> all show that biodiversity in the Afro-Arabian region is highly vulnerable to projected climate change. To save what is left, conservation measures should prioritise the hotspot areas, i.e. regions with a high number of endemic species. Vanishing species and populations will potentially affect the existing ecological network as some species may experience ecological release and others may be suppressed causing cascades of extinctions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">76</xref>
 </sup>. The Afro-Arabian species exhibit high physiological plasticity and distinct evolutionary histories that provide valuable insights into the genetic basis of species tolerance to environmental extremes

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, losing these endemic species could lead to a loss in the pool of important genetic information that is vital for understanding species’ evolution and survival in extreme environments
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>
 </sup>. As such, conservation efforts need to maximise species dispersal within their suitable habitat; this would slow down the rate of extinction by maintaining the interaction between species and populations and preserving the genetic network
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>
 </sup>. We highly recommend applying adaptive conservation strategies inside and outside protected areas as a first critical step forward

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>
 </sup>. These strategies include three options: 1) the 
 <italic class="italic">resistance</italic> option, reducing the threat impacts and conserving valued resources (e.g., reducing non-climatic stress—invasive species and habitats fragmentation— and promoting green energy), 2) the 
 <italic class="italic">resilience</italic> option, restoring the ecosystem functions (e.g., improving protected area networks and habitats connectivity), and 3) the 
 <italic class="italic">response</italic> option, allowing the ecosystem transition to new conditions (e.g., using transboundary protected areas)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" class="xref">78</xref>
 </sup>. The existing protected area networks can be used to initiate the adaptive conservation strategies. Increasing redundancy in the existing protected area networks can provide species with more opportunities to move and disperse, which, ultimately, improves species resilience to climate change
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">79</xref>
 </sup>. The existing protected area networks in the Afro-Arabian region are few, small in size, and spatially disconnected
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, expanding the protected area networks is likely to preserve various environmental conditions, improve habitat connectivity, and facilitate species dispersal along different environmental gradients
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">77</xref>
 </sup>. Additionally, we recommend establishing new protected areas to cover the regions predicted to experience high turnover rates (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), and managing the surrounding habitats in ways that allow for species dispersal and movement. The socio-economic aspect and community-based conservation approach need to be considered in the conservation management plan to achieve a long-term conservation success
