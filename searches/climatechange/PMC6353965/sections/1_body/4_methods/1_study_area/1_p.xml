 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). This region has relatively high topographic heterogeneity (altitude varies from ~−400 to 4000 meters a.s.l.) and habitat diversity (sand dunes, coastal plains, mountains). It encompasses mainly three distinct climatic regions: warm Mediterranean, warm semi-arid, and warm desert
