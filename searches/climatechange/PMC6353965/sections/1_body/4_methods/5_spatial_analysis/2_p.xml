<p id="Par33" class="p">Additionally, we accounted for the ability of species to track the changes in climate using two dispersal scenarios: Unlimited Dispersal (UD), assuming that the species can disperse freely and adjust their distribution range according to climate, and No Dispersal (ND), where species are assumed to be unable to disperse and, as a consequence, will not be able to occupy the projected suitable habitats. According to the rate of change in species distribution ranges, we assigned each species to a threat category following the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) threat categories
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137" class="xref">137</xref>
 </sup>. We applied the following criteria as described in IUCN Red List criterion A3(c): Extinct when a species is predicted to lose 100% of its current potential range; Critically Endangered when a projected range loss is &gt;80%; Endangered projects a range loss of &gt;50%; and Vulnerable when a projected range loss is &gt;30%

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>. IUCN Red List criterion A3(c) estimate the rate of geographic range decline over a period of 10 year or three generations, whichever is the longer

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138" class="xref">138</xref>
 </sup>, we used the generation definition and considered each time period (2050 and 2070) as equal to three generations.
