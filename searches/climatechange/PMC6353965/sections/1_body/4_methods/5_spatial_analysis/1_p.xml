<p id="Par32" class="p">We quantified the impact of global change on the spatial biodiversity patterns through two indices: species richness and species turnover. Species richness is important for understanding the ecological and evolutionary processes that shape the biodiversity in a given location and is one of essential measures for prioritising conservation efforts
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134" class="xref">134</xref>
 </sup>. We estimated species richness for current and future, 2050 and 2070, by summing up the predicted relative likelihoods of species occurrence for all species for the corresponding time
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>
 </sup>. Species turnover is a measure of dissimilarity in the composition of species assemblages from site to site within a given time frame or over time within a given site
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135" class="xref">135</xref>
 </sup>. We used the Bray-Curtis index to quantify the “temporal” species turnover, dissimilarity for each pixel between the current and future, using the “vegdist” function in the “vegan” R package

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136" class="xref">136</xref>
