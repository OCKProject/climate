<p id="Par31" class="p">Finally, we projected the model predictions onto the Afro-Arabian region to determine the contemporary potential distribution for each species. For species with a large MCP (&gt;50% of the study area), we used the entire study area for model calibration. We used spatial cross-validation to avoid calibrating and evaluating based on the same data

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>
 </sup>. To this end, we segregated species localities geographically into four blocks, then, models were built in an iterative manner, using three blocks for calibration and the remaining fourth block for evaluation in each iteration, until all blocks have been used once for evaluation

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>
 </sup>. This allowed for: 1) maintaining spatial independence between training and test data, 2) avoiding AUC inflation due to spatial auto-correlation between training and test data and, 3) incorporating the uncertainty in the estimated probability

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123" class="xref">123</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124" class="xref">124</xref>
 </sup>. We evaluated the predictive performance of the models by assessing their ability to predict relative likelihoods of species occurrence within the test data blocks, using the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125" class="xref">125</xref>
 </sup>, as well as the True Skill Statistic (TSS)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126" class="xref">126</xref>
 </sup>. We projected the contemporary species distribution ranges into the future (2050 and 2070) in order to assess the possible consequences of climate changes on the biodiversity in the Afro-Arabian region. There is large variability among general circulation models (GCMs), which can cause uncertainties in species distribution projections
