<p id="Par27" class="p">Point occurrences for 107 mammal species (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), specifically 95 endemic and 12 near-endemic species (&gt;70% of their distribution ranges within the study region), were assembled from different resources, including personal fieldwork, published and “gray” literature, online portals, and personal communications (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). We updated species taxonomy following the Mammal Species of the World portal
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">81</xref>
 </sup>. We restricted the species records to those only collected from the wild between 1960 and 2005, and omitted the duplicated occurrences within one grid cell (~5 × 5 km). To correct for sampling bias, we applied a spatial filtering approach
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">82</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>
 </sup>. Specifically, we filtered records of each species to obtain the highest achievable occurrences that are 5, 10, and 20 km apart for small, volant, and large mammals respectively. We chose these distances to represent the mean dispersal ability of each group. This should lead to less spatially autocorrelated records with less environmental bias, and yield better prediction for species distribution ranges
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84" class="xref">84</xref>
 </sup>. We acknowledge that there are several bias correction approaches such as calibrating the model with extra predictors representing site accessibility or sampling effort, or background manipulation
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">85</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86" class="xref">86</xref>
 </sup>. However, in this study we favoured spatial filtering since it has been shown to outperform other bias correcting approaches
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87" class="xref">87</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>
 </sup>. As a consequence, it has been widely applied recently to correct the spatial and environmental bias in species data
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">83</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>
 </sup>. Spatial filtering outweighs the negative influence of the biased data and substantially minimises omission errors (i.e. suitable areas not predicted by models) and commission errors (i.e. areas mistakenly predicted to be suitable) particularly in areas with limited surveying effort
