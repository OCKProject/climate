<p id="Par28" class="p">We initially selected 26 environmental predictors, 19 contemporary climatic predictors available from the WorldClim database and seven non-climatic predictors characterising the topography and vegetation, at a resolution of 2.5 arc-min (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>), to model species distributions. This resolution allows for mitigating the uncertainty that might result from the positional uncertainty associated with the species occurrences, and also for avoiding the issue of not identifying local refugia, a common issue in coarse spatial resolution climate change projections found on correlative SDMs

To assess the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of the focal species, we retrieved projections of future climate variables from four general circulation models (GCMs), HadGEM2-AO, CCSM4, IPSL-CM5A-LR, and ACCESS1-0, downscaled to 2.5 arc-min resolution from the IPCC Fifth Assessment, available from the WorldClim database for the years 2050 and 2070
