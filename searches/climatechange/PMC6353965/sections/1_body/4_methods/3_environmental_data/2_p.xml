<p id="Par29" class="p">We used the RCP 8.5 pessimistic emission scenario that assumes increasing in the global population and slow per capita economic growth, leading to high energy demand and high GHG emissions and the average temperature over time in absence of climate change policies

 </sup>. Therefore, we restricted our analysis to the RCP 8.5 scenario as most realistic scenario (or even the most pessimistic), for the Afro-Arabian region, that is probably representing the actual situation in the study area and also bears only the risk of our results being a conservative outcome. Finally, since there is no data on the ‘vegetation continuous field’ (VCF) variable

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">104</xref>
 </sup> and how it might change in the future, we assumed that VCF remains constant to be able to include it in the future predictions
