<p class="p">A review of the public health literature identified three primary climate-related environmental public health hazards for the region (extreme heat, drought, and flooding) and a suite of related exposure, health outcome, population vulnerability, and environmental vulnerability indicators. Indicators that performed more poorly at the county level than at the state and national levels were defined as “high vulnerability.” The most urban county, Daviess, illustrated the urban/rural divide in relation to vulnerable populations—for example, identifying homeless populations and populations with mental illness as highly vulnerable groups in comparison with outdoor workers and populations with existing chronic conditions, as seen in the more rural counties.</p>
