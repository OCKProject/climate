<p class="p">The project's short timeline, limited funding, and capacity constraints precluded the use of statistical analysis to identify the subset of indicators that were most relevant to each county or the region as a whole. The project report recommends filling this gap under the next round of funding. Given this constraint, which is not uncommon at local health departments, we directly compared each local indicator with parallel Kentucky and US datasets, if available, to establish a rough understanding of which indicators might prove to be outliers using more sophisticated methods of analysis. Five indicators were also compared with federal standards: exposure to air pollution (compared with US EPA 2012 annual standard for fine particulate matter concentrations [

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">108</xref>]), heart disease mortality (compared with Healthy People 2020 Goal HDS-2 [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]), asthma hospitalizations (compared with Healthy People 2020 Goal RD-2.2 [
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">110</xref>]), and cerebrovascular deaths (compared with Healthy People 2020 Goal HDS-3 [
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">109</xref>]). Indicators were defined as high vulnerability if they fell short of both Kentucky and US indicators. They were defined as moderate if they fell in between the larger-scale indicators. And they were defined as low if they represented an improvement over both the Kentucky and US indicators.
