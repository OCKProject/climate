<p class="p">The Green River District (GRD) is comprised of seven counties in Western Kentucky: Daviess, Hancock, Henderson, McLean, Ohio, Webster, and Union. It is a predominantly rural area, with two major population centers, Owensboro and Henderson. Total population in 2014 fell just shy of 215,300 residents [

The diversity in land use represented across the district, particularly comparing the two more urban counties (Daviess and Henderson) with the five fully rural counties, presents an opportunity to assess the unique challenges and opportunities facing rural health districts engaged in protecting their populations from the negative health effects of climate change.
