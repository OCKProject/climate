<p class="p">First, we reviewed the Third National Climate Assessment [
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] and the associated scientific assessment of the impacts of climate change on human health [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] to develop a short list of climate-related environmental hazards with a history and/or projected future of risk to human health in the Southeastern US. We then gathered evidence at a more granular level [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>] to identify which hazards were associated with the most negative health outcomes and highest economic burdens in rural Western Kentucky. Finally, we consulted with climatologists, emergency management officials, and other subject matter experts at the local and state levels to validate our selection of extreme heat, drought, and flooding as the leading climate-related hazards for the region.
