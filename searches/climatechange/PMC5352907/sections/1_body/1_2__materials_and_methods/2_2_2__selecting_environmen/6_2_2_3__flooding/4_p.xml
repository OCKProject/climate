<p class="p">Similar to extreme heat and drought, children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to negative health outcomes after exposure to flooding. Both groups are more vulnerable than the population as a whole to flooding-related injuries and illnesses [

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]. Children are particularly vulnerable if they are separated from their caregivers [

 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Both populations are also particularly susceptible to the negative mental health effects of flooding ([

 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]) associated with the loss of property and loved ones, economic hardship, and dislocation. These health outcomes include anxiety, PTSD, aggression in children, and suicidal tendencies [
