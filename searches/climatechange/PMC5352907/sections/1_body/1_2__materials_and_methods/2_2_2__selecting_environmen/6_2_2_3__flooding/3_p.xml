 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>–
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>] to gastrointestinal illnesses [

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>] and mental health concerns [

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. Other flooding-related morbidities and mortalities are more difficult to track, because flooding may not be listed as a primary cause in the diagnosis or on the death certificate [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, p. 114]. However, it can be extrapolated in some cases. For example, poor indoor air quality arising from dampness and mold in the home is currently associated with 8%–20% of respiratory infections in the US (such as acute bronchitis) and with exacerbating 4.6 million cases of asthma [
