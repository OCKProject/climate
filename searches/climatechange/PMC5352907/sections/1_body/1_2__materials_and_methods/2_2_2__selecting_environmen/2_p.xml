<p class="p">We used a three-step review process adapted from the CDC's Building Resilience Against Climate Effects (BRACE) framework to identify which climate-related hazards should be developed into environmental public health indicators for the GRDHD. The BRACE framework is a five-step approach to informing public health adaptation efforts at the state and local levels. The five steps are as follows: (1) Anticipating Climate Impacts and Assessing Vulnerabilities; (2) Projecting the Disease Burden; (3) Assessing Public Health Interventions; (4) Developing and Implementing a Climate and Health Adaptation Plan; and (5) Evaluating Impact and Improving Quality of Activities [
