<p class="p">The population vulnerability indicators associated with drought overlap with extreme heat, in part, because the two hazards can occur concurrently. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable to the effects that drought can have on air quality and water quality [

Finally, rural areas have been associated with more severe mental health concerns (such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) during droughts than urban areas, due to the strong economic relationship between precipitation and agricultural yields [
