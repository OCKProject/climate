<p class="p">It can be difficult to quantify the direct health effects of drought, because they tend to result from a complex interplay of socioeconomic variables (such as loss of livelihood); local environmental characteristics (such as land use patterns); and interactions between the drought and other related natural events (such as the prevalence of wildfires or the duration of a heat wave) [
