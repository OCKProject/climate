<p class="p">The CDC's National EPHT Network was designed to compile data on environmental hazards, human exposure, and health effects into a single network of standardized databases. This framework enables researchers to evaluate relationships between datasets that historically have been difficult to review side by side [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. Data is currently available via an online portal at three spatial scales: federal, state, and county. While the majority of datasets are available at the federal level, the CDC funds 25 states (including Kentucky) and 1 city to assist in compiling and making public the smaller spatial scales [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>) recognizes the need to supplement National EPHT datasets with external sources for two purposes: (a) to assess a community's vulnerability to the health effects of climate change and (b) to establish metrics for evaluating the success of local climate and health policies.
