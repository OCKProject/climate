<p class="p">The Green River District demonstrates high risk for two of the key vulnerable populations characteristic of rural areas, as identified in the scientific literature: the elderly and families living in poverty (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). All seven counties in the district host a slightly higher proportion of elderly populations (aged 65+) than the national average or the commonwealth of Kentucky. Every county except for Hancock also exceeds the national proportion of populations living in poverty. However, only Ohio County also exceeds both the national and Kentucky average.
