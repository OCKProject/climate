<p class="p">Residents of the GRD are highly vulnerable to flooding, in part, due to development in known floodplains. The FEMA floodplain was listed as a high vulnerability indicator for all counties in the district except for Webster County, because they exceed the Kentucky (5.4%) percentage of populations living in the 100-year floodplain (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Three counties—Daviess (13.6%), Hancock (14.7%), and McLean (12.8%)—demonstrate more than double the average statewide exposure [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. From a geographic perspective, every county except Webster also greatly exceeds the percentage of Kentucky (9.8%) land located in a floodplain, with close to one-half of the land in Henderson (43.2%) and McLean (45.3%) counties located in vulnerable areas [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">106</xref>]. In spite of the relatively high percentage of residents in the district living in a floodplain, less than 2% hold current flood insurance policies [
