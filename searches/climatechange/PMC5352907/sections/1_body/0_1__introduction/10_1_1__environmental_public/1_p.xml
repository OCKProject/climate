<p class="p">Environmental public health indicators are a key component of vulnerability assessments. They are the building blocks for assessing a population's exposure and underlying vulnerabilities to environmentally related health threats such as climate change. They can also be used to track the success of policy and programmatic interventions aimed at reducing vulnerability. However, existing indicators often do not distinguish between rural and urban geographic areasâ€”either aggregating to a larger geographic area (such as the state or county level) or not providing information for sparsely populated areas.</p>
