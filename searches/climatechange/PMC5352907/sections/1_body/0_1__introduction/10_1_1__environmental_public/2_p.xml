<p class="p">The National Environmental Public Health Tracking (EPHT) Program, hosted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), shares key vulnerability and health outcome environmental public health indicators at the national, state, and county levels for a wide array of environmental hazards, including climate change [

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The Green River District Health Department (GRDHD) conducted the project reviewed in this article under a grant from EnviroHealthLink. The project's goal was to reduce vulnerability to the negative health effects of climate change in a predominately rural region of Western Kentucky. Recognizing the resource and capacity constraints at a rural local health department, we set the objective of using existing online tools and datasets to bring an evidence-base to GRDHD activities relevant to climate change. To this end, we tailored EnviroHealthLink for use at the local level. Using the National EPHT online portal as a foundational resource for gathering datasets, we developed climate change environmental public health indicators relevant to the needs of a rural district. Our second objective was to identify opportunities for integrating the indicators into ongoing public health efforts, such as the community health assessment process and existing health surveillance programs. Our third objective was to identify opportunities for collaboration with partnering agencies, to ensure that vulnerable populations are prioritized in all resilience activities.
