<p class="p">Rural demographics include a disproportionate percentage of populations that have been shown to be vulnerable to climatic events. Rural populations tend to be older, less affluent, less well educated, and suffering from higher levels of unemployment than urban residents [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Of these demographic characteristics, elderly populations and families living in poverty have also been identified as populations who are particularly vulnerable to climatic events ([

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]; [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>, p. 108]). Population health status as a whole is often lower in rural areas than in urban areas, particularly in relation to chronic disease, in spite of rural residents' spending a higher proportion of their income on medical care than their urban counterparts [
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. Furthermore, the fragility of the rural built and emergency response infrastructure exacerbates the vulnerability of groups such as the elderly, families living in poverty, people of color, and populations with limited English proficiency, who have a higher likelihood of living in isolated rural areas [
