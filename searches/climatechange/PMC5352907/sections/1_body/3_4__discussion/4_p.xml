<p class="p">The GRDHD epidemiology program monitors the health status of the community and investigates disease clusters and outbreaks. A passive surveillance system is already in place, tracking infectious diseases reported by health care providers and other community members. Several reportable conditions are relevant to climate and health surveillance, such as mosquito-borne diseases (West Nile Virus, Zika Virus, etc.) and waterborne disease outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">116</xref>]. The epidemiology department also provides morbidity and mortality surveillance to the state health department during community outbreaks and disasters. Based on the results of this study, the GRDHD plans on expanding both the surveillance and reporting arms of the epidemiology department to track environmental exposure indicators for all three climate hazards and reportable health outcomes for extreme heat and flooding (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Future work may include correlating health outcome data with the dates when extreme heat or flooding events occurred, in order to validate or change the thresholds established during this project to trigger heat-, drought-, and flooding-related surveillance activities, public education campaigns, and interventions such as opening cooling centers and emergency shelters.
