<p class="p">Comparing the baseline climate change environmental public health indicators for the Green River District, Daviess County's more urban status distinguished it from the other six counties, particularly in terms of the need to develop educational messaging and services for homeless populations. Baseline indicators for the more rural counties, on the other hand, included an emphasis on outdoor workers and populations with existing chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and asthma. These differences indicate that climate and health policies and interventions in the Green River District must distinguish between the needs of rural and urban populations in the seven-county region.</p>
