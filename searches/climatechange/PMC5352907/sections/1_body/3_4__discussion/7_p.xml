<p class="p">Finally, the study results have been distributed as an addendum to the 2015 Green River Community Health Assessment (CHA),

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://healthdepartment.org/community-health/community-health-plans/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://healthdepartment.org/community-health/community-health-plans/</ext-link>). The report's focus on vulnerable populations aligns with the goals of the CHA. Many of the populations identified by the climate and health scientific literature as vulnerable to extreme heat, drought, and/or flooding have also been identified in the CHA as requiring special consideration under other health-promoting programs. For example, the 2015 CHA tracks the percentage of children, elderly, non-Hispanic Blacks, and populations living in poverty for each county in the Green River District. Additionally, mental health concerns and language barriers are highlighted as areas in need of improvement to advance community health. The assessment also highlights three Kentucky Health Now Goals that overlap with the climate and health indicators listed in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>: obesity, cardiovascular disease, and mental health [
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">117</xref>]. Local communities utilize the health assessment to establish priorities and develop strategic planning efforts to improve the health and resiliency of their community. The most recent CHA, published in 2015, focuses on reducing substance abuse, reducing obesity, reducing teen pregnancy, and improving access to health care and mental health services. The climate and health addendum will facilitate conversations about the links between climate change and environmental health during the next planning process, due to begin in 2017.
