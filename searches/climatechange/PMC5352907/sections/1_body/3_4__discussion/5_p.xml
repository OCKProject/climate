<p class="p">The health department supports local emergency preparedness agencies to safeguard the health of vulnerable populations during and after both natural and human-caused disasters. Much of this work involves public communicationâ€”explaining the health risks associated with an event and ways for individuals to protect themselves and their families. The health department plans to use the results of this study to tailor heat, drought, and flooding emergency response activities to the highest risk populations in each county.</p>
