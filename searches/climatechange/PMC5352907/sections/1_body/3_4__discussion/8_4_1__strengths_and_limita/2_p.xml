<p class="p">Due to schedule, resource, and capacity constraints, the phase of the project reviewed by this article did not include the mapping, spatial analysis, and statistical validation performed by Reid et al. and Prudent et al. That additional step is necessary to identify the subgroups and specific locations at highest risk of negative health effects after exposure to extreme heat, drought, and/or flooding. However, additional quantitative analysis and validation were identified in the project report as important objectives pending future funding opportunities.</p>
