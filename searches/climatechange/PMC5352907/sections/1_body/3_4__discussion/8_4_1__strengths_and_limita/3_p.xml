Illinois has developed geospatial indices at the county level for social vulnerability, flooding vulnerability, and the effects of ozone on asthma vulnerability (

And the Minnesota Department of Health has included climate-related environmental health and human health indicators (such as air quality, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, heat-related illness, and Lyme disease) in its overall data access portal (
