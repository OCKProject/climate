<p class="p">The project reviewed in this article addressed a gap in both climate and health research and practice, namely, the shortage of vulnerability assessments in rural areas [

 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">119</xref>], developed composite climate change vulnerability indices based on a core set of indicators. Importantly, these indices were mapped to subcounty spatial scales to help local authorities and partners pinpoint the locations within counties where multiple vulnerabilities converge. This information can be used to target investment in adaptation and emergency response efforts.
