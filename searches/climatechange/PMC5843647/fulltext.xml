Phenotypic plasticity, the expression of different phenotypes from the same genome in response to environmental variation, is a widespread adaptation in seasonal habitats that allows organisms to maximise fitness as they track the predictable cycles of contrasting ecological conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. These cycles place divergent selective pressures on an organism&#x02019;s life history, rewarding phenotype-environment matching via seasonally plastic strategies, such as timing of breeding in birds, the diapause decision in multivoltine insects, and seasonal wing patterns in butterflies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">While the ecological relevance of phenotypic plasticity is evident, its on-going impact on evolutionary dynamics is more contentious<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. To what extent and under what circumstances phenotypic plasticity potentiates evolutionary adaptation to novel environments and thus facilitates population persistence under environmental change, or instead limits such adaptation, remains unresolved. This question has particular urgency in the context of rapid climate change, which is already having profound impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, the integration of biological mechanisms into predictive models of resilience to climate change is hampered by a lack of empirical data, for crucial parameters, including physiology, phenology and genetic variances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">An important limit on adaptive potential in seasonal habitats is the lack of genetic variation for plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Theoretical models of plasticity and population resilience generally assume such variation to be sufficiently present (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>), but there is actually little empirical support for this assumption, as data on natural genetic variation for seasonal plasticity in natural populations is scarce&#x000a0;(e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> but see e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>). Of concern is the possibility that in predictable environments, selection against phenotype-environment mismatches will deplete variation in plasticity. In seasonally plastic organisms there is strong selection favouring a match between the expressed phenotype and what is needed to survive and/or reproduce in the prevailing seasonal environment. This requires predictability of seasonal transitions, and tuning of the phenotypic response for a particular trait (the reaction norm) to the reliability of environmental cues that predict the selective environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. If a cue is highly reliable, selection favours a trait reaction norm that is highly sensitive to the cue. Alternative reaction norms for that trait, that are less sensitive to the reliable cue, or tuned to a different, unreliable cue, will produce a maladaptive mismatch between phenotype and environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Ongoing purifying selection against such mismatches will, under stable long-term climatic conditions, remove standing genetic variation for plasticity from the population.</p><p id="Par6">Under climate change, characterised by increased environmental stochasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, the reliability of existing environmental cues as predictors for seasonal progression will likely diminish. As a consequence, the most common (i.e., previously adaptive) reaction norm is then more likely to produce mismatches between phenotype and environment. Such maladaptive phenological shifts are already being observed in many species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Under these conditions, selection will favour alternative reaction norms, for example with a different sensitivity to the environmental cue or bet-hedging strategies. Theoretical models predict that reduced environmental predictability places species with strong plasticity under increased extinction risk<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and a rapid response to selection for alternative reaction norms hinges on the presence of sufficient standing variation for plasticity. However, if past purifying selection has depleted this variation, the potential for evolutionary change is limited in the short term<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, reducing the probability of population persistence under rapid climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Thus, rather than giving rise to adaptable generalists, phenotypic plasticity in seasonal habitats may generally result in specialists with reduced short-term adaptive potential that are particularly vulnerable to climate change. While selection on plasticity for timing of breeding has been documented in a wild-bird population in response to climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, many other species or populations lack such adaptive potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, raising unanswered questions about why such variation may be depleted.</p><p id="Par7">In order to clarify the role of plasticity in adaptation to climate change, we analyse adaptive potential in a textbook model of seasonal plasticity: the African savannah butterfly <italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). This species produces generations of butterflies that are highly distinctive in wing pattern, behaviour, and life history strategy across alternating seasonal environments<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. As life histories are highly relevant for climate adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, our focus here is on seasonal plasticity in life history. In the warm wet season, when food and reproductive opportunities are abundant, these butterflies live short lives of fast growth and maximal reproduction, allocating less resources to body maintenance. In contrast, in the cool dry season, when adult food (fruit) is limited and larval food (grasses) absent, these adults express a life history focused on inactivity, postponed reproduction and long lifespan<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. The resulting life history syndrome comprises an integrated suite of coordinated traits, responding in a threshold-like manner to the seasonal environment via a common temperature-sensitive hormonal regulator<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Pervasive seasonal plasticity and intra-population genetic variation across the transcriptome. <bold>a</bold>
<italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic> butterflies of the dry (brown) and wet (green) season differ in a suite of behavioural, life history, and morphological traits, depending on the seasonal environment in which they developed. <bold>b</bold>, <bold>c</bold> Principal components analysis (PCA) of whole-transcriptome expression profiles for abdomen (<bold>b</bold>) and thorax (<bold>c</bold>) significantly separates individuals reared in wet (green) or dry (brown) season conditions along the first Principal Component (accounting for 15&#x02013;16% of variance). For abdomen, the second PC (10% of variance) significantly separates individuals from different full-sib families (indicated by different symbols), whereas for thorax the third PC (6% of variance) separates families. Families are also significantly separated by several other PCs, together accounting for 56 and 27% of variance in abdomen and thorax (see Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref> for all PCs and statistical tests).

Encoded by a shared genome deployed differently across the seasons, such alternative life histories are expected to be regulated by distinct transcriptional programmes. Here we focus on thorax and abdomen tissues, as we previously discovered that their relative importance, such as in reproduction (abdomen) and flight performance (thorax), is season-dependent<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>, and they likely express genes relevant for lifespan, metabolism and stress resistance. Our study thus enables identifying tissue-specific and systemic mechanisms involved in plasticity. Furthermore, analysing the transcriptome as a highly dimensional plastic phenotype provides a comprehensive and quantitative picture of plasticity and its evolutionary potential. For wing pattern the potential for plasticity to evolve has been found to be limited<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>, but whether life history traits are similarly constrained is unknown. Finally, to further elucidate adaptive potential in plasticity, we additionally analyse the effect of stress, which has been suggested to either aid or constrain adaptive potential<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In a previous phenotypic study in <italic>Bicyclus</italic> butterflies, we found substantial effects of food stress on all five life history traits studied, with two showing season-specific responses, and for one trait the heritability was affected by food stress<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Given that phenotypic studies can only feasibly analyse a handful of traits, our study here aims to contribute to a more comprehensive, quantitative understanding of the role of stress in adaptive potential.</p><p id="Par9">Here we quantify the potential for evolutionary change in plasticity, combining an RNA-Seq approach with a full-factorial split-brood design across 144 individual transcriptomes. Specifically, we (1) characterise the transcriptional architecture of the seasonal phenotypes, (2) quantify intra-population genetic variation for plasticity, (3) assess footprints of selection on plasticity in coding regions and (4) determine the role of stress in constraining or increasing adaptive potential. Our analysis uncovers high amounts of seasonal plasticity in the transcriptome, reflecting a genome-wide plasticity programme, consistent with the integrated suite of traits involved in the seasonal adaptation. Strikingly, intra-population genetic variation for this plastic response is largely absent, with low levels of gene-by-environment interaction and highly similar seasonal responses across families. We hypothesise that this reduction reflects strong purifying selection in the savannah habitat where temperature serves as a reliable cue for predicting seasonal transitions, and the fitness cost of a mismatched phenotype is high<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Consistent with this, Tajima&#x02019;s D, a measure of DNA sequence polymorphism, is reduced in genes differing in plasticity across families, while this gene set shows no such reduction in an outgroup species lacking strong polyphenism. Stressful conditions during development decrease the transcriptional divergence between the seasons, but this is not accompanied by increased genetic variance for plasticity. Our results show that lack of genetic variation for plasticity may critically limit evolutionary potential and population persistence under environmental change, providing empirical support for theoretical predictions that species with strong phenotypic plasticity may be at elevated extinction risk when environmental predictability breaks down.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Seasonal plasticity across the transcriptome</title><p id="Par10">In order to understand how the shared genome is deployed differently across the seasonal environments to produce the distinct phenotypic morphs, we analysed the transcriptional architecture of plasticity. We compared gene expression between the wet and the dry season forms, in a full-factorial analysis of environmental and heritable effects across 72 individuals, analysing thorax and abdomen separately. Three independent analyses revealed large fractions of the abdomen and thorax transcriptome to be involved in seasonal plasticity, consistent with the large effect of the seasonal environment on many life history phenotypes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. Differential expression analyses revealed that in abdomen and thorax, 46 and 47% of genes showed significant season-biased expression, respectively (FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), with alternative mapping and filtering approaches yielding similar results (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Principal components analysis (PCA) of the whole-transcriptome expression profiles found PC1, accounting for 15&#x02013;16% of total variance, significantly separating individuals from wet and dry season environments (two-way ANOVA <italic>F</italic><sub>1,55</sub>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;38, FDR&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>; Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>, <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of gene expression confirmed these patterns, with individuals clustering strongly by season (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">7</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">Examining the seasonal plasticity programme in more detail revealed systemic and tissue-specific components, both at the level of individual genes and functional processes. A total of 2115 genes showed the same response to the seasonal environment in both body parts, representing 14 and 17% of the abdomen and thorax transcriptome (Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">1</xref>), respectively, and these were enriched for 89 functional GO terms. In addition to these genes showing systemic plasticity, 32 and 30% of genes showed tissue-specific seasonal bias in abdomen and thorax transcriptomes, and were enriched for 155 and 186 GO terms, of which 109 and 140 were unique in each body part, and 37 were shared with concordant seasonal bias (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; Supplementary Data&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). As expected for plasticity genes involved in the seasonal phenotypes, average expression levels for season-biased genes were significantly higher than for unbiased genes (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">9</xref>). Thus, within and across tissues, the seasonal environment is a major determinant of transcriptional variation, representing a genome-wide seasonal plasticity programme. Both the large numbers of genes involved in plasticity and their functions are consistent with the broad suite of life history traits involved in the seasonal adaptation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. While a substantial part of the transcriptional response is systemic, reflecting an integrated and coordinated environmental response across the body, the largest component to the seasonal transcriptional response is tissue-specific, reflecting modular, independent responses to the seasonal environment (Supplementary Notes).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Systemic and tissue-specific components of the plasticity programme.

This contrasts sharply with the high levels of genetic variation for expression averaged across the seasons, where families vary extensively in average gene expression patterns. As a consequence, there is ample opportunity for evolutionary change in average gene expression in the same direction in both seasons, but potential for change in plasticity is limited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Footprints of selection on plasticity in the transcriptome</title><p id="Par19">
In order to assess whether the observed lack of genetic variation for plasticity is due to purifying selection on reaction norms, we analysed polymorphism in coding sequence of abdomen-expressed genes. We compared genes that show inter-family differences in plasticity (i.e., gene-by-environment interaction or GxE) with those showing no GxE. Specifically, we quantified Tajima&#x02019;s D, the difference between the fraction of pairwise nucleotide differences <italic>&#x003c0;</italic> and fraction of segregating sites <italic>&#x003b8;</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>, and found a significant decrease to a median of 0.32 for genes showing GxE (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;158) from 0.40 for genes showing no GxE (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;14,749; Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041). This decreased Tajima&#x02019;s D, or excess of rare alleles, was not observed for other gene repertoires (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">11</xref>). While negative values of Tajima&#x02019;s D can indicate positive selection, genes experiencing positive selection are expected to be rare in the genome and outliers compared to genome-wide averages. Instead, our observed reduction in Tajima&#x02019;s D among the GxE genes suggests increased selection against novel variants (cf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>), consistent with increased purifying selection on these reaction norms.</p><p id="Par20">
To further assess whether other potential processes than purifying selection could be at work, we considered whether novel genes might be driving the observed polymorphism pattern, as duplicated genes that have recently become fixed in the population can also show reduced Tajima&#x02019;s D, i.e., an excess of rare alleles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>. However, this alternative explanation is unlikely for several reasons. First, recently fixed novel genes should also show reduced pairwise diversity (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, but instead we observe similar levels of <italic>&#x003c0;</italic> between genes with inter-family variation in plasticity (GxE) compared to the rest of the genome (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">12</xref>). Second, these genes do not show significant enrichment for novel, lineage-specific genes. To assess this, we searched for orthologs in <italic>Pieris rapae</italic>, a temperate butterfly species that shows much lower levels of seasonal polyphenism, and defined novel genes as those for which we could not find any putative ortholog (although these genes could also represent gene loss in the <italic>P. rapae</italic> lineage). Of the 10,466 <italic>B. anynana</italic> transcripts with a <italic>P. rapae</italic> hit, 1.0% (101) showed gene-by-environment interaction in expression. Among the 4583 <italic>B. anynana</italic> transcripts without a hit to <italic>P. rapae</italic>, this proportion was slightly higher, with 1.3% (59) of these <italic>B. anynana</italic> transcripts showing GxE in expression. However, this was not significant (<italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.8, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.09), making it unlikely that the low level of Tajima&#x02019;s D among the GxE genes is driven by these genes being more novel than other genes in the genome. Finally, if purifying selection in a highly predictable seasonal environment caused the observed reduction in Tajima&#x02019;s D for genes showing GxE, these genes should show no such reduction in a species without the specific selective history of <italic>B. anynana</italic>. Using population re-sequencing data for <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>, we assessed Tajima&#x02019;s D in the orthologs of the <italic>B. anynana</italic> GxE genes, and found no significant difference compared to the rest of the genome (Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13a</xref>). However, in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic> pairwise nucleotide polymorphism (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>) in these genes was 43% higher than the rest of the genome (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005), suggesting that in this species this set of genes might be under relaxed selection (Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">13b</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the most likely explanation for the lack of gene-by-environment interactions and excess of rare alleles at GxE genes in <italic>B. anynana</italic> is purifying selection in its natural habitat, the highly predictable savannah environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Developmental food stress and adaptive potential</title><p id="Par21">We assessed whether stressful conditions might aid adaptive potential, either by inducing phenotypic expression of genetic variance that is not visible under normal conditions, or by disrupting normal patterns of plasticity. We exposed developing larvae (of both seasonal forms) to a period of food stress, and observed only minor effects on seasonal plasticity (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Expression of &#x0003c;10 genes showed a significant interaction between seasonal plasticity and food stress, indicating that for virtually all genes the seasonal response was not different under stressed compared to ad libitum conditions. Examining the effect of food stress in more detail for specific gene repertoires revealed subtle stress-induced shifts in normal seasonal expression patterns. In particular, stress pushed the typical dry season morph towards a slightly more wet season-like transcriptional profile, partly driven by an emergency response in the abdomen comparable to a terminal reproductive investment, with wet season genes showing increased expression upon stress (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">14</xref>). However, this limited reduction in transcriptional divergence between the seasonal forms was not accompanied by increased genetic variance for plasticity. The three-way interaction between genetic background, food stress treatment and seasonal environment only affected a small number of genes, indicating a very limited effect of stress on genetic variation for plasticity and thus potential for stress to release genetic variation in plasticity. These results were consistent when using alternative filtering and mapping approaches or applying an additional fold change &#x0003e;2 threshold (Supplementary Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>; Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In conclusion, we found no evidence that stressful conditions released genetic variation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par22">The role plasticity plays in enhancing or constraining adaptive potential has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>). On the one hand, evolutionary adaptation to novel environments may be constrained due to plasticity reducing the strength of selection by buffering environmental variation and thus hiding low-fitness variants from selection. On the other hand, plasticity could facilitate evolutionary adaptation in novel environments as plastic populations express a wider range of phenotypes than non-plastic populations, and new phenotypic optima may be more easily reached if they can be directly induced by the environment rather than produced from new genetic variants). More recent theoretical studies highlight the importance of environmental predictability in determining whether strong plasticity is an advantage or liability under rapid environmental change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and suggest that a reduction in environmental predictability places species with strong plasticity under increased extinction risk.</p><p id="Par23">Here we study adaptive potential in a seasonally plastic butterfly with highly distinct alternative phenotypes, and observe a striking lack of intra-population genetic variation for plasticity. Families display very similar transcriptional responses to the seasonal environment for nearly all transcripts, with significantly reduced inter-family variance in reaction norm slope. In marked contrast, families differ significantly in average expression for approximately half of all transcripts, with high inter-family variance in reaction norm intercept. These high levels of variation for average gene expression have also been observed in other animal populations (e.g., in fruitflies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>; butterflies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>; sticklebacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>; and other species in the wild<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>). The observed lack of variation for plasticity is not due to inbreeding, as that would also depress genetic variation for average expression among families. Another potential confounder, relaxed purifying selection due to laboratory breeding conditions, is also unlikely to play an important role. Relaxed selection on plasticity would result in increased rather than decreased genetic variation for plasticity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> and potentially reduced plasticity overall (cf.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>). Instead, our results suggest that the most likely explanation is enhanced purifying selection solely upon reaction norms, consistent with variation in expression plasticity for these genes being largely absent in the founding population.</p><p id="Par24"><italic>Bicyclus anynana</italic> inhabits a strongly seasonal savannah environment, with vastly differing food availability and reproductive opportunities between the dry and wet seasons, making it crucial to produce the right phenotype at the right moment. In Nkhata Bay in Malawi, source of the laboratory population<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, transitions between the seasons are highly predictable, with a strong positive correlation between monthly averaged precipitation and minimum temperature in the previous month<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (<italic>&#x003c1;</italic><sub>pearson</sub>&#x02009;=&#x02009;+0.85; Supplementary Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">15</xref>). This puts a premium on a single-reaction norm optimally tuned to the specific temperature cue predicting seasonal transitions. Alternative reaction norms, producing the wrong phenotype, would lead to a maladaptive mismatch between seasonal environment and expressed phenotype<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>. Given the vastly contrasting selective pressures across the seasons, reaction norms producing such mismatches would likely be strongly selected against. This ongoing purifying selection should deplete genetic variation for plasticity, without affecting overall levels of genetic variation for expression. Consistent with this, we find relatively few genes showing gene-by-environment interaction in expression, and those that do show GxE have an excess of rare mutations (i.e., low Tajima&#x02019;s D), consistent with increased purifying selection. Additional analyses of these GxE genes revealed that they neither exhibit patterns of pairwise diversity consistent with recent gene duplication events<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup>, nor are enriched for novel genes. Finally, we assessed the patterns of genetic variation in the orthologs of these GxE genes in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>rapae</italic>, a temperate butterfly species without strong seasonal polyphenism, and found them to be more polymorphic than the rest of the genome, suggestive of a relaxation of purifying selection. This latter finding is consistent with considerable to high levels of gene-by-environment interaction in the transcriptome among many species that lack seasonal polyphenism, including <italic>Drosophila</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>, yeast<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>, butterflies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, sticklebacks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> and other fish<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. However, not all species show these patterns, and they vary with the type of environmental treatment and whether laboratory or wild populations were assayed (e.g.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>). Unfortunately, most studies focus on genetic variation in plasticity across multiple populations (but see refs. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>), and data on species in strongly seasonal environments is particularly lacking. Future analyses focused upon gene turnover and evolutionary rates within a phylogenetic framework, comparing species differing in seasonal and/or thermal plasticity, are likely to shed important light on the evolutionary forces acting on regulators of plasticity compared to the rest of the genome.</p><p id="Par25">
Our results on transcriptional plasticity support earlier work on phenotypic trait plasticity and evolution on this same population. Many seasonally plastic traits, such as growth rate, metabolic rate, starvation resistance and wing pattern also show significant intra-population genetic variation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>, and artificial selection was highly successful in shifting mean trait expression, i.e., the reaction norm intercept (e.g.,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup>). However, reaction norm slopes show high-across-environment genetic correlations and very limited genetic variation, precluding evolutionary responses to artificial selection targeting the slope of the reaction norm, at least in morphological traits<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref></sup>. Our transcriptional data, revealing largely absent GxE for gene expression in tissues involved in life history plasticity, together with phenotypic data where most traits lacked GxE<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>, strongly suggest that life history traits are similarly constrained (see also<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>).</p><p id="Par26">The expression of genetic variance is environment-dependent, yet the impact of unfavourable environmental conditions on genetic variation, and hence adaptability under environmental change, is disputed<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>.

This is not surprising, given that the seasonal adaptation in <italic>B. anynana</italic> represents a broad and integrated life history syndrome, encompassing a suite of traits including growth rate, size at maturity, hormone physiology, metabolic rate, fat metabolism, reproductive strategy and starvation resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref></sup>. Whereas some of these traits are likely underpinned by systemic transcriptional patterns, others such as reproduction are more compartmentalised into specific body parts and tissues. Indeed, we observe that the seasonal transcriptional response is partly driven by a systemic plasticity programme, at both the level of individual genes and functional pathways, and partly by tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. The simultaneous occurrence of both systemic and tissue-specific plasticity is consistent with the known regulation by ecdysteroid hormones of seasonal plasticity for a broad suite of wing pattern and life history traits. The hormone system enables integration and coordination of plasticity across the body via systemic hormone titres, while at the same time allowing flexibility and independence via compartmentalised, time- and tissue-specific responses<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref></sup>. Fitting this model, season-biased genes for both abdomen and thorax were enriched for steroid signalling without overlap of individual genes, indicating tissue-specific roles for this hormone system. Genes involved in regulation of transcription (including DNA methylation) and in juvenile hormone signalling were also strongly season-biased in both body parts, underlining the importance of regulatory processes in seasonal plasticity. In addition, we also identified processes more directly linked to the phenotype, some of which were systemic, such as immunity, lipid metabolism and oxidoreductase activity, and others that were only enriched in the abdomen, such as response to oxidative stress (e.g., Catalase), or the thorax, such as processes related to the actin cytoskeleton, important for flight muscles. Interestingly, a substantial fraction (6%) of the shared transcriptome showed opposite patterns of season-bias between the tissues, with enrichment for processes like ubiquitination, cell division, lipid metabolism and translation. This likely reflects trade-offs between body parts, for example in investment in growth, storage and turnover of resources, which shift between seasons.</p><p id="Par28">In comparison to our results for the abdomen and throax, a separate study in <italic>B. anynana</italic> found the seasonal forms to be much less differentiated in the head transcriptome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup>, suggesting that behavioural differences are less pronounced than physiological phenotypes, at least early in adult life. This underscores the modularity of seasonal plasticity, where body parts contribute specific functions to alternative morphs, a pattern often observed in other animals. For example in the beetle <italic>Onthophagus taurus</italic>, phenotypic plasticity is highly modular across the body, with different body parts showing distinct transcriptional responses and evolutionary rates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup>. Whether the modularity of plasticity observed in <italic>B. anynana</italic> enhances adaptive potential under environmental change remains to be tested.</p><p id="Par29">
Taken together, our results indicate that the potential for evolutionary change in plasticity in this population is constrained by the current lack of genetic variation for plasticity, at least in the short term, and any evolutionary response in plasticity will thus depend upon novel mutations affecting reaction norms. This limited adaptive potential will only surface if selective pressures change in such a way that the currently dominant reaction norm no longer has the highest fitness, and instead produces a mismatch between expressed phenotype and the new selective environment. Current climate change represents exactly such a scenario, as not only temperature means are increasing rapidly, but also variance in temperature and precipitation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. This will likely deteriorate the reliability of existing environmental cues for seasonal progression, increasing selective pressures for alternative reaction norms and, given the limited genetic variation for plasticity, weakening prospects for population persistence.</p><p id="Par30">In many seasonal habitats, species depend on environmental cues such as temperature or day length to prepare for seasonal transitions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. A modelling study shows that decreased environmental predictability increases extinction risk for plastic species<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>, and indeed climate change, by affecting environmental cues, as well as seasonal timing, is already increasing mismatches between phenotype and seasonal environment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Even where species respond to climate change by shifts in seasonal timing, the adjustment in phenology is often too subtle or too extreme, leading to frequent mismatches in phenotype with seasonal progression<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. Although microevolutionary changes in such responses are crucial for population resilience to climate change, there is limited empirical data on the extent of natural genetic variation for seasonally plastic responses, curtailing our understanding of adaptive potential of populations facing climate change<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Our study illustrates that specialised seasonal plasticity may result in reduced adaptability in the face of environmental change via lack of genetic variation for seasonal reaction norms. Given the ubiquity of seasonal habitats across tropical and temperate areas, this likely applies to many species and thus represents an underappreciated limit to biotic climate change resilience.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec9"><title>Study organism and experimental design</title><p id="Par31">We used a captive laboratory population of <italic>B. anynana</italic>, reared under standardised outbred conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Because de novo transcriptome assemblies produce a large number of contigs per locus, resulting from transcriptional noise and misassemblies, as well as SNPs and isoforms, we collapsed our assembly to biologically meaningful transcripts by aligning the coding regions and keeping the longest transcript, using the EvidentialGene pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/trassembly.html">http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/trassembly.html</ext-link>).

After filtering (evalue &#x0003c;0.00001 and bitscore &#x0003e;50), this yielded valid UniRef protein names for 14,681 transcripts.

In addition to the mapping approach described above, we used the mapping programs NextGenMap v0.5.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup> and RSEM v1.2.19<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup>.

EdgeR incorporates methods to account for data heteroscedasticity. As input data for edgeR we used untransformed, raw count data (after filtering to remove genes with low expression, see above). Thus, expression of each individual transcript was modelled as follows: raw counts&#x02009;~&#x02009;seasonal temperature&#x02009;+&#x02009;food treatment&#x02009;+&#x02009;family&#x02009;+&#x02009;season-by-family&#x02009;+&#x02009;food-by-family&#x02009;+&#x02009;season-by-food&#x02009;+&#x02009;season-by-food-by-family. For each factor of interest, edgeR analyses yielded a fold change between the conditions, a likelihood ratio for the effect of that factor, and a corresponding <italic>P-</italic>value.

As input, we used lists of genes (and their fold change) that were significantly season-biased in thorax, abdomen or both body parts, and the Argot2 GO annotation file. The GSE analyses yield a log odds ratio for enrichment associated with each GO term, with the same sign as fold change values in expression: positive for GO terms enriched among wet season-biased genes and negative for GO terms enriched among dry season-biased genes.

Cluster analyses were performed by constructing a neighbour joining tree from the Euclidian distance matrix computed from the normalised expression data using the R package &#x0201c;ape&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup>. PCA were calculated by single-value decomposition using the R function prcomp. To assess the association between Principal Components (PCs) and experimental factors, two-way ANOVAs were performed on the scores of each PC separately, with seasonal environment, family and their interaction as fixed factors. We computed family-specific reaction norms for each gene by fitting, for each family separately, the normalised expression data for that gene in a general linear model with season as the sole predictor. This yielded, for each family separately, the intercept and slope of this model, which was then used to calculate coefficient of variance across the seven full-sib families for both the intercept and slope. Differences in the transcriptome-wide distribution of these coefficients of variance were tested with two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (two-sided, using the function wilcoxsign-test from R package &#x0201c;coin&#x0201d;). We calculated cross-environment genetic correlations in normalised expression for each gene by averaging gene expression per family within each seasonal environment (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4&#x02013;6 females per tissue per family per season) and calculating Pearson&#x02019;s correlation coefficient using the expression of each of seven families in the wet season and in the dry season. Differences in log<sub>2</sub> fold change values for the same genes but due to different experimental factors were tested with two-sided two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, testing whether log<sub>2</sub> fold change values differed significantly from zero was done using one-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and testing whether absolute expression differed between gene repertoires were tested using two-sided Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-tests. We generally preferred non-parametric tests as these are more robust to heteroscedasticity and differences in sample sizes. Log<sub>2</sub> fold changes were calculated in edgeR, and those involving family (as main effect or in interaction with another factor) were calculated using all six mutually orthogonal contrasts between the seven families, and averaged across contrasts. Using maximum log<sub>2</sub> fold change across contrasts rather than mean yielded similar results.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Sequence polymorphism across the transcriptome</title><p id="Par39">In order to assess footprints of selection in different gene repertoires, we quantified nucleotide diversity (<italic>&#x003c0;</italic>) and Tajima&#x02019;s D for each transcript expressed in the abdomen.
