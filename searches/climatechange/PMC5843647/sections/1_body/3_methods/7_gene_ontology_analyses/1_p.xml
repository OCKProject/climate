 </sup>, using the FatiScan module. As input, we used lists of genes (and their fold change) that were significantly season-biased in thorax, abdomen or both body parts, and the Argot2 GO annotation file. The GSE analyses yield a log odds ratio for enrichment associated with each GO term, with the same sign as fold change values in expression: positive for GO terms enriched among wet season-biased genes and negative for GO terms enriched among dry season-biased genes. The associated
