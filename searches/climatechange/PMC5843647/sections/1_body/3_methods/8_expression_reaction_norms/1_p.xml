 </sup>. PCA were calculated by single-value decomposition using the R function prcomp. To assess the association between Principal Components (PCs) and experimental factors, two-way ANOVAs were performed on the scores of each PC separately, with seasonal environment, family and their interaction as fixed factors. We computed family-specific reaction norms for each gene by fitting, for each family separately, the normalised expression data for that gene in a general linear model with season as the sole predictor. This yielded, for each family separately, the intercept and slope of this model, which was then used to calculate coefficient of variance across the seven full-sib families for both the intercept and slope. Differences in the transcriptome-wide distribution of these coefficients of variance were tested with two-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (two-sided, using the function wilcoxsign-test from R package “coin”). We calculated cross-environment genetic correlations in normalised expression for each gene by averaging gene expression per family within each seasonal environment (
