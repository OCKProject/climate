 <italic class="italic">rapae</italic> butterflies were collected during the summer of 2014, just south of Barcelona, Spain (Delta del Llobregat). DNA was extracted from thorax material using a modified version of a salt-extraction protocol. Library construction (PCR-free, paired end, 500 bp insert size), and sequencing (Illumina HiSeq 4000, 100 bp PE reads) was performed at BGI. Fastq data were quality-filtered to a minimum PHRED score of Q10, with ends trimmed of adapters and low-quality bases, and screened for common contaminants using bbduk2 (BBMap v35.69,

The Pool-seq data were mapped to the genome using Next-Gen Mapper v0.4.10 with an identity cutoff of 90% to minimise mapping bias
