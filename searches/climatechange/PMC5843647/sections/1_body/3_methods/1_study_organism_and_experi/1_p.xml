 </sup>. In order to assess the effect of genetic background, seasonal environment, food stress and their interactions on the transcriptome, we employed a full-factorial split brood design with 72 females from seven full-sib families, reared at two temperatures (19 °C corresponding to dry season, and 27 °C corresponding to wet season), and two developmental food stress treatments (ad libitum and food stress in the fifth larval instar). We chose a single sex (females) because for many phenotypic life history traits, sex interacts strongly both with seasonal plasticity and stress response

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>. Within each family, the design was balanced with four families having three females for each combination of family, seasonal temperature and food treatment, and the three other families having two females per treatment group. This yielded sample sizes for the main effects of food, season and family of 36, 36 and 8–12, respectively, and 4–6 for the two-way family-by-food or family-by-season interactions (see Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref> for details). These sample sizes are per tissue, as we sampled thorax and abdomen from each female, and analysed the transcriptomes separately. Sample sizes represent biological, not technical replicates, and were chosen to maximise the number of families while maintaining sufficient replication within families for each experimental factor. After sequencing, we removed five outliers (out of 144 samples), based on SNPs and expression clustering patterns. Within this same experiment, we have collected phenotypic data on additional individuals and families, which we published previously

 </sup>. Allocation of newly hatched first instar larvae to each of four experimental treatments was done randomly, with no blinding. One day after eclosion we sampled females for RNA isolation (snap-freezing in liquid N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>), and separated thorax and abdomen for individual sequencing, using whole thorax and whole abdomen while removing heads, and all legs and wings.
