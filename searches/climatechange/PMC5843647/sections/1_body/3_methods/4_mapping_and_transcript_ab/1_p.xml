 </sup>. To further reduce transcriptional noise prior to differential expression analysis, we applied a low-expression filter by removing genes with low or very limited expression, processing the 72 thorax and 72 abdomen libraries separately. We removed genes that were expressed in &lt;3 samples, as well as genes with mean expression &lt;0.25 counts per million (CPM). After filtering, we retained 15,049 and 12,567 genes for abdomen and thorax, respectively, accounting for &gt;99.9% of all read counts.
