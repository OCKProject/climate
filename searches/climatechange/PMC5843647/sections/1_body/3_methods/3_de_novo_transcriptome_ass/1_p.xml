 </sup>, combining reads from all libraries (i.e. thorax and abdomen), yielding 496,087 contigs. Because de novo transcriptome assemblies produce a large number of contigs per locus, resulting from transcriptional noise and misassemblies, as well as SNPs and isoforms, we collapsed our assembly to biologically meaningful transcripts by aligning the coding regions and keeping the longest transcript, using the EvidentialGene pipeline (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/trassembly.html" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://arthropods.eugenes.org/EvidentialGene/trassembly.html</ext-link>). This yielded a filtered high-quality transcriptome of 35,747 contigs with an N50 of 1839 and N10 of 4561, with the vast majority being assembled near full length (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">16</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>). To annotate it, we performed a blastp search of the 35,747 predicted proteins against the UniRef90 database

 </sup>. After filtering (evalue &lt;0.00001 and bitscore &gt;50), this yielded valid UniRef protein names for 14,681 transcripts. Separately, we used Argot2 to obtain Gene Ontology (GO) terms for our transcriptome

 </sup>, yielding 6107 unique GO terms for 15,991 transcripts, with a mean of 5.2 GO terms per annotated transcript. After removing GO terms with &lt;4 or &gt;500 genes, and as recommended

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">61</xref>
 </sup> terms with Argot2 total score &lt;200, we retained 13,192 transcripts annotated with 2183 unique GO terms (3.4 terms per transcript).
