 </sup> to test the main effects of seasonal temperature, food treatment, family, the three two-way interactions, as well as the one three-way interaction between the main effects on expression of all expressed genes in the transcriptome (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). EdgeR incorporates methods to account for data heteroscedasticity. As input data for edgeR we used untransformed, raw count data (after filtering to remove genes with low expression, see above). Thus, expression of each individual transcript was modelled as follows: raw counts ~ seasonal temperature + food treatment + family + season-by-family + food-by-family + season-by-food + season-by-food-by-family. For each factor of interest, edgeR analyses yielded a fold change between the conditions, a likelihood ratio for the effect of that factor, and a corresponding

 </sup>, accepting an FDR of 0.05. The sign of fold change values for the effect of season is with reference to the wet season, i.e. genes with positive and negative fold change values being wet and dry season-biased, respectively.
