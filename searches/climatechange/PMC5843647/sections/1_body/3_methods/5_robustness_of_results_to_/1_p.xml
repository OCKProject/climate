<p id="Par35" class="p">In order to exclude the possibility that our results would be biased by the choice of transcriptome filtering, mapping, transcript abundance estimation, or expression filtering strategy, we repeated differential expression analyses (a) without the low-expression filter, (b) using different reference transcriptome filtering, mapping and abundance estimation approaches, and (c) with an additional fold change 2 threshold for significant differential expression. In addition to the mapping approach described above, we used the mapping programs NextGenMap v0.5.0

 </sup> and RSEM v1.2.19

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>
 </sup>. The latter program (which uses Bowtie2 internally) was tested using both the unfiltered Trinity transcriptome assembly (at both isoform and gene level) and the Evigene-enriched transcriptome as a reference (see Supplementary TableÂ
