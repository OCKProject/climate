<p id="Par21" class="p">We assessed whether stressful conditions might aid adaptive potential, either by inducing phenotypic expression of genetic variance that is not visible under normal conditions, or by disrupting normal patterns of plasticity. We exposed developing larvae (of both seasonal forms) to a period of food stress, and observed only minor effects on seasonal plasticity (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). Expression of &lt;10 genes showed a significant interaction between seasonal plasticity and food stress, indicating that for virtually all genes the seasonal response was not different under stressed compared to ad libitum conditions. Examining the effect of food stress in more detail for specific gene repertoires revealed subtle stress-induced shifts in normal seasonal expression patterns. In particular, stress pushed the typical dry season morph towards a slightly more wet season-like transcriptional profile, partly driven by an emergency response in the abdomen comparable to a terminal reproductive investment, with wet season genes showing increased expression upon stress (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">14</xref>). However, this limited reduction in transcriptional divergence between the seasonal forms was not accompanied by increased genetic variance for plasticity. The three-way interaction between genetic background, food stress treatment and seasonal environment only affected a small number of genes, indicating a very limited effect of stress on genetic variation for plasticity and thus potential for stress to release genetic variation in plasticity. These results were consistent when using alternative filtering and mapping approaches or applying an additional fold change &gt;2 threshold (Supplementary Figs.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). In conclusion, we found no evidence that stressful conditions released genetic variation.
