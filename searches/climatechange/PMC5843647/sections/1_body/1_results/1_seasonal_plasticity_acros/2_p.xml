<p id="Par11" class="p">Examining the seasonal plasticity programme in more detail revealed systemic and tissue-specific components, both at the level of individual genes and functional processes. A total of 2115 genes showed the same response to the seasonal environment in both body parts, representing 14 and 17% of the abdomen and thorax transcriptome (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), respectively, and these were enriched for 89 functional GO terms. In addition to these genes showing systemic plasticity, 32 and 30% of genes showed tissue-specific seasonal bias in abdomen and thorax transcriptomes, and were enriched for 155 and 186 GO terms, of which 109 and 140 were unique in each body part, and 37 were shared with concordant seasonal bias (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>). As expected for plasticity genes involved in the seasonal phenotypes, average expression levels for season-biased genes were significantly higher than for unbiased genes (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">9</xref>). Thus, within and across tissues, the seasonal environment is a major determinant of transcriptional variation, representing a genome-wide seasonal plasticity programme. Both the large numbers of genes involved in plasticity and their functions are consistent with the broad suite of life history traits involved in the seasonal adaptation

 </sup>. While a substantial part of the transcriptional response is systemic, reflecting an integrated and coordinated environmental response across the body, the largest component to the seasonal transcriptional response is tissue-specific, reflecting modular, independent responses to the seasonal environment (Supplementary Notes).
