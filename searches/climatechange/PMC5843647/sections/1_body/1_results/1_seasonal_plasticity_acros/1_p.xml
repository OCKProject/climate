<p id="Par10" class="p">In order to understand how the shared genome is deployed differently across the seasonal environments to produce the distinct phenotypic morphs, we analysed the transcriptional architecture of plasticity. We compared gene expression between the wet and the dry season forms, in a full-factorial analysis of environmental and heritable effects across 72 individuals, analysing thorax and abdomen separately. Three independent analyses revealed large fractions of the abdomen and thorax transcriptome to be involved in seasonal plasticity, consistent with the large effect of the seasonal environment on many life history phenotypes

 </sup>. Differential expression analyses revealed that in abdomen and thorax, 46 and 47% of genes showed significant season-biased expression, respectively (FDR &lt; 0.05; Supplementary Fig.
