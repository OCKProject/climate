<p id="Par19" class="p"> In order to assess whether the observed lack of genetic variation for plasticity is due to purifying selection on reaction norms, we analysed polymorphism in coding sequence of abdomen-expressed genes. We compared genes that show inter-family differences in plasticity (i.e., gene-by-environment interaction or GxE) with those showing no GxE. Specifically, we quantified Tajima’s D, the difference between the fraction of pairwise nucleotide differences 
 <italic class="italic">π</italic> and fraction of segregating sites 
 <italic class="italic">θ</italic>
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>
 </sup>, and found a significant decrease to a median of 0.32 for genes showing GxE (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 158) from 0.40 for genes showing no GxE (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 14,749; Mann–Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.041). This decreased Tajima’s D, or excess of rare alleles, was not observed for other gene repertoires (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">11</xref>). While negative values of Tajima’s D can indicate positive selection, genes experiencing positive selection are expected to be rare in the genome and outliers compared to genome-wide averages. Instead, our observed reduction in Tajima’s D among the GxE genes suggests increased selection against novel variants (cf.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>
 </sup>), consistent with increased purifying selection on these reaction norms.
