<p id="Par20" class="p"> To further assess whether other potential processes than purifying selection could be at work, we considered whether novel genes might be driving the observed polymorphism pattern, as duplicated genes that have recently become fixed in the population can also show reduced Tajima’s D, i.e., an excess of rare alleles
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>. However, this alternative explanation is unlikely for several reasons. First, recently fixed novel genes should also show reduced pairwise diversity (
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>
 </sup>, but instead we observe similar levels of 
 <italic class="italic">π</italic> between genes with inter-family variation in plasticity (GxE) compared to the rest of the genome (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">12</xref>). Second, these genes do not show significant enrichment for novel, lineage-specific genes. To assess this, we searched for orthologs in 
 <italic class="italic">Pieris rapae</italic>, a temperate butterfly species that shows much lower levels of seasonal polyphenism, and defined novel genes as those for which we could not find any putative ortholog (although these genes could also represent gene loss in the 
 <italic class="italic">P. rapae</italic> lineage). Of the 10,466 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> transcripts with a 
 <italic class="italic">P. rapae</italic> hit, 1.0% (101) showed gene-by-environment interaction in expression. Among the 4583 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> transcripts without a hit to 
 <italic class="italic">P. rapae</italic>, this proportion was slightly higher, with 1.3% (59) of these 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> transcripts showing GxE in expression. However, this was not significant (
 <italic class="italic">χ</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 2.8, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.09), making it unlikely that the low level of Tajima’s D among the GxE genes is driven by these genes being more novel than other genes in the genome. Finally, if purifying selection in a highly predictable seasonal environment caused the observed reduction in Tajima’s D for genes showing GxE, these genes should show no such reduction in a species without the specific selective history of 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic>. Using population re-sequencing data for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rapae</italic>, we assessed Tajima’s D in the orthologs of the 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> GxE genes, and found no significant difference compared to the rest of the genome (Mann–Whitney 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.32; Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">13a</xref>). However, in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">rapae</italic> pairwise nucleotide polymorphism (
 <italic class="italic">π</italic>) in these genes was 43% higher than the rest of the genome (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.005), suggesting that in this species this set of genes might be under relaxed selection (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">13b</xref>). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the most likely explanation for the lack of gene-by-environment interactions and excess of rare alleles at GxE genes in 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> is purifying selection in its natural habitat, the highly predictable savannah environment.
