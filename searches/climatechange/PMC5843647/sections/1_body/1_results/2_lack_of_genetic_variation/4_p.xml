<p id="Par15" class="p">Third, PCA confirmed that inter-family variation in plasticity of expression represents a tiny fraction of total transcriptional variance, contrasting with variation between families being a large driver of average gene expression. In thoraces, none of the first 13 Principal Components (together accounting for 62% of total variance) associated with the interaction between seasonal environment and genetic background (two-way ANOVA, FDR &gt; 0.49,

In contrast, a total of 7 and 9 PCs significantly associated with genetic background as main effect, in abdomen and thorax respectively, and together these PCs explained 56 and 27% of total transcriptional variance in each body part (two-way ANOVAs; FDR = 0.01–10
