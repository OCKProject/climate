<p id="Par17" class="p"> Finally, we observed high-positive genetic correlations in gene expression across seasonal environments (Supplementary Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">10</xref>), with median Spearman Rank correlations of +0.67 and +0.47, for abdomen and thorax, respectively. This indicates that for many genes, expression in one season is genetically coupled with expression in the other season, and there is limited genetic variation for expression that is independent between the seasons.
