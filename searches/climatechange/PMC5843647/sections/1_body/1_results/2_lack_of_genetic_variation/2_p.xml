<p id="Par13" class="p">First, expression of only 1% of genes (160 and 146 genes in abdomens and thoraces, respectively) was significantly affected (FDR &lt; 0.05) by the interaction between seasonal environment and family, i.e., by a genotype-by-environment interaction (GxE; see Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> for a list of all GxE genes). In contrast, genetic background (i.e., family) significantly affected average expression for 66% and 42% of genes in abdomen and thorax, respectively (Fig.

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). Using alternative filtering and mapping approaches or applying an additional fold change &gt;2 threshold yielded very similar results (Supplementary Notes; Supplementary Figs.
