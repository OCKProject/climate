<p id="Par16" class="p">Fourth, analysis of reaction norms in gene expression revealed that families are much more similar in how expression responds to the environment than in their average expression levels. We computed family-specific seasonal reaction norms, comparing across-family variance in slope (plasticity) and intercept (average expression), and found that variance in slope was 57 and 32% lower than variance in intercept, for abdomen and thorax respectively (Fig.
