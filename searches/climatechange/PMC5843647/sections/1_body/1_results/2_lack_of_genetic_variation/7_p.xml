<p id="Par18" class="p">Together, these analyses provide evidence for a substantial reduction of intra-population genetic variation for plasticity, with low levels of gene-by-environment interaction and different full-sib families having highly similar seasonal responses. This contrasts sharply with the high levels of genetic variation for expression averaged across the seasons, where families vary extensively in average gene expression patterns. As a consequence, there is ample opportunity for evolutionary change in average gene expression in the same direction in both seasons, but potential for change in plasticity is limited.</p>
