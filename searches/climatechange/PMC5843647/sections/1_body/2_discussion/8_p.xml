<p id="Par29" class="p"> Taken together, our results indicate that the potential for evolutionary change in plasticity in this population is constrained by the current lack of genetic variation for plasticity, at least in the short term, and any evolutionary response in plasticity will thus depend upon novel mutations affecting reaction norms. This limited adaptive potential will only surface if selective pressures change in such a way that the currently dominant reaction norm no longer has the highest fitness, and instead produces a mismatch between expressed phenotype and the new selective environment. Current climate change represents exactly such a scenario, as not only temperature means are increasing rapidly, but also variance in temperature and precipitation

 </sup>. This will likely deteriorate the reliability of existing environmental cues for seasonal progression, increasing selective pressures for alternative reaction norms and, given the limited genetic variation for plasticity, weakening prospects for population persistence.
