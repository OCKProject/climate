<p id="Par25" class="p"> Our results on transcriptional plasticity support earlier work on phenotypic trait plasticity and evolution on this same population. Many seasonally plastic traits, such as growth rate, metabolic rate, starvation resistance and wing pattern also show significant intra-population genetic variation

 </sup>). However, reaction norm slopes show high-across-environment genetic correlations and very limited genetic variation, precluding evolutionary responses to artificial selection targeting the slope of the reaction norm, at least in morphological traits
