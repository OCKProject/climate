<p id="Par27" class="p">A large portion of the transcriptome is involved in seasonal plasticity, with almost half of all expressed genes showing season-biased expression. This is not surprising, given that the seasonal adaptation in

 </sup>. Whereas some of these traits are likely underpinned by systemic transcriptional patterns, others such as reproduction are more compartmentalised into specific body parts and tissues. Indeed, we observe that the seasonal transcriptional response is partly driven by a systemic plasticity programme, at both the level of individual genes and functional pathways, and partly by tissue-specific regulation of gene expression. The simultaneous occurrence of both systemic and tissue-specific plasticity is consistent with the known regulation by ecdysteroid hormones of seasonal plasticity for a broad suite of wing pattern and life history traits. The hormone system enables integration and coordination of plasticity across the body via systemic hormone titres, while at the same time allowing flexibility and independence via compartmentalised, time- and tissue-specific responses

 </sup>. Fitting this model, season-biased genes for both abdomen and thorax were enriched for steroid signalling without overlap of individual genes, indicating tissue-specific roles for this hormone system. Genes involved in regulation of transcription (including DNA methylation) and in juvenile hormone signalling were also strongly season-biased in both body parts, underlining the importance of regulatory processes in seasonal plasticity. In addition, we also identified processes more directly linked to the phenotype, some of which were systemic, such as immunity, lipid metabolism and oxidoreductase activity, and others that were only enriched in the abdomen, such as response to oxidative stress (e.g., Catalase), or the thorax, such as processes related to the actin cytoskeleton, important for flight muscles. Interestingly, a substantial fraction (6%) of the shared transcriptome showed opposite patterns of season-bias between the tissues, with enrichment for processes like ubiquitination, cell division, lipid metabolism and translation. This likely reflects trade-offs between body parts, for example in investment in growth, storage and turnover of resources, which shift between seasons.
