<p id="Par28" class="p">In comparison to our results for the abdomen and throax, a separate study in 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> found the seasonal forms to be much less differentiated in the head transcriptome
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>
 </sup>, suggesting that behavioural differences are less pronounced than physiological phenotypes, at least early in adult life. This underscores the modularity of seasonal plasticity, where body parts contribute specific functions to alternative morphs, a pattern often observed in other animals. For example in the beetle 
 <italic class="italic">Onthophagus taurus</italic>, phenotypic plasticity is highly modular across the body, with different body parts showing distinct transcriptional responses and evolutionary rates

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>
 </sup>. Whether the modularity of plasticity observed in 
 <italic class="italic">B. anynana</italic> enhances adaptive potential under environmental change remains to be tested.
