<p id="Par22" class="p">The role plasticity plays in enhancing or constraining adaptive potential has been discussed extensively in the literature (e.g.,
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>â€“
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>). On the one hand, evolutionary adaptation to novel environments may be constrained due to plasticity reducing the strength of selection by buffering environmental variation and thus hiding low-fitness variants from selection. On the other hand, plasticity could facilitate evolutionary adaptation in novel environments as plastic populations express a wider range of phenotypes than non-plastic populations, and new phenotypic optima may be more easily reached if they can be directly induced by the environment rather than produced from new genetic variants). More recent theoretical studies highlight the importance of environmental predictability in determining whether strong plasticity is an advantage or liability under rapid environmental change

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>, and suggest that a reduction in environmental predictability places species with strong plasticity under increased extinction risk.
