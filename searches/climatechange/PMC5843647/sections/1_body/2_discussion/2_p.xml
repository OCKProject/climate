<p id="Par23" class="p">Here we study adaptive potential in a seasonally plastic butterfly with highly distinct alternative phenotypes, and observe a striking lack of intra-population genetic variation for plasticity. Families display very similar transcriptional responses to the seasonal environment for nearly all transcripts, with significantly reduced inter-family variance in reaction norm slope. In marked contrast, families differ significantly in average expression for approximately half of all transcripts, with high inter-family variance in reaction norm intercept. These high levels of variation for average gene expression have also been observed in other animal populations (e.g., in fruitflies

 </sup>; and other species in the wild

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>
 </sup>). The observed lack of variation for plasticity is not due to inbreeding, as that would also depress genetic variation for average expression among families. Another potential confounder, relaxed purifying selection due to laboratory breeding conditions, is also unlikely to play an important role. Relaxed selection on plasticity would result in increased rather than decreased genetic variation for plasticity

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>
 </sup>). Instead, our results suggest that the most likely explanation is enhanced purifying selection solely upon reaction norms, consistent with variation in expression plasticity for these genes being largely absent in the founding population.
