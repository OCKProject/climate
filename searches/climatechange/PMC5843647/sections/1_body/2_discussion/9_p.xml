 </sup>. Even where species respond to climate change by shifts in seasonal timing, the adjustment in phenology is often too subtle or too extreme, leading to frequent mismatches in phenotype with seasonal progression

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>. Although microevolutionary changes in such responses are crucial for population resilience to climate change, there is limited empirical data on the extent of natural genetic variation for seasonally plastic responses, curtailing our understanding of adaptive potential of populations facing climate change

 </sup>. Our study illustrates that specialised seasonal plasticity may result in reduced adaptability in the face of environmental change via lack of genetic variation for seasonal reaction norms. Given the ubiquity of seasonal habitats across tropical and temperate areas, this likely applies to many species and thus represents an underappreciated limit to biotic climate change resilience.
