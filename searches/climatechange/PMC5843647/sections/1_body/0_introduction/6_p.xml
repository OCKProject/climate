<p id="Par8" class="p"> Encoded by a shared genome deployed differently across the seasons, such alternative life histories are expected to be regulated by distinct transcriptional programmes. Here we focus on thorax and abdomen tissues, as we previously discovered that their relative importance, such as in reproduction (abdomen) and flight performance (thorax), is season-dependent

 </sup>, and they likely express genes relevant for lifespan, metabolism and stress resistance. Our study thus enables identifying tissue-specific and systemic mechanisms involved in plasticity. Furthermore, analysing the transcriptome as a highly dimensional plastic phenotype provides a comprehensive and quantitative picture of plasticity and its evolutionary potential. For wing pattern the potential for plasticity to evolve has been found to be limited

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>, but whether life history traits are similarly constrained is unknown. Finally, to further elucidate adaptive potential in plasticity, we additionally analyse the effect of stress, which has been suggested to either aid or constrain adaptive potential

 <italic class="italic">Bicyclus</italic> butterflies, we found substantial effects of food stress on all five life history traits studied, with two showing season-specific responses, and for one trait the heritability was affected by food stress
