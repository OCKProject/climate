 </sup>. To what extent and under what circumstances phenotypic plasticity potentiates evolutionary adaptation to novel environments and thus facilitates population persistence under environmental change, or instead limits such adaptation, remains unresolved. This question has particular urgency in the context of rapid climate change, which is already having profound impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning
