<p id="Par3" class="p">Understanding how populations adapt to changing environments is of fundamental importance for assessing their evolutionary and ecological dynamics, and for predicting population resilience to climate change. Phenotypic plasticity, the expression of different phenotypes from the same genome in response to environmental variation, is a widespread adaptation in seasonal habitats that allows organisms to maximise fitness as they track the predictable cycles of contrasting ecological conditions

 </sup>. These cycles place divergent selective pressures on an organismâ€™s life history, rewarding phenotype-environment matching via seasonally plastic strategies, such as timing of breeding in birds, the diapause decision in multivoltine insects, and seasonal wing patterns in butterflies
