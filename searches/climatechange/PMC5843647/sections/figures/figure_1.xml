   <italic class="italic">Bicyclus anynana</italic> butterflies of the dry (brown) and wet (green) season differ in a suite of behavioural, life history, and morphological traits, depending on the seasonal environment in which they developed.

   <bold class="bold">c</bold> Principal components analysis (PCA) of whole-transcriptome expression profiles for abdomen (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) and thorax (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) significantly separates individuals reared in wet (green) or dry (brown) season conditions along the first Principal Component (accounting for 15–16% of variance). For abdomen, the second PC (10% of variance) significantly separates individuals from different full-sib families (indicated by different symbols), whereas for thorax the third PC (6% of variance) separates families. Families are also significantly separated by several other PCs, together accounting for 56 and 27% of variance in abdomen and thorax (see Supplementary Figs.
