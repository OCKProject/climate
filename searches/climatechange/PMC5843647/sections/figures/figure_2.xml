  <p class="p">Systemic and tissue-specific components of the plasticity programme. For each gene expressed in both body parts, seasonal expression bias (log
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> fold change of expression in wet season compared to dry season) in thorax (vertical axis) is plotted against expression bias in abdomen (horizontal axis), with positive fold change values indicating higher expression in wet season, and negative values indicating higher expression in dry season. Each gene is represented by a black dot, and genes significantly differentially expressed (FDR &lt; 0.05) between wet and dry season are coloured in green and brown for wet and dry season-biased genes, respectively (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold"> c</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>), or in blue (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>). Numbers in each quadrant indicate numbers of significant wet or dry season-biased genes. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> The systemic plasticity programme is represented by 2115 genes that show the same response to the seasonal environment in both body parts, representing 14 and 17% of the abdomen and thorax transcriptome, respectively, and enriched for 89 functional GO terms. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Expression for 781 genes shows opposite patterns of season bias between the two body parts, i.e., expression is wet season-biased in one body part and dry season-biased in the other body part. These genes are enriched for 37 GO terms. 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>, 
   <bold class="bold">d</bold> The abdomen- and thorax-specific plasticity programmes are represented by 32 and 30% of genes in each body part, and are enriched for 155 and 189 GO terms. This includes genes expressed in both body parts but season-biased in only one (presented in this figure), as well as genes expressed exclusively in one body part (Supplementary Notes). Selected GO terms are visualised in Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">8</xref>, all GO terms are listed in Supplementary Data 
   <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>, and a list of all season-biased gene is presented in Supplementary Data
