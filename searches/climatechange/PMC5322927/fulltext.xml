The availability of days suitable for field work is driven by soil temperature and moisture, both of which may be altered by climate change. We projected changes in Illinois season length, spring field workability, and summer drought risk under three different emissions scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2) down to the crop district scale. Across all scenarios, thermal time units increased in parallel with a longer frost-free season. An increase in late March and Early April field workability was consistent across scenarios, but a decline in overall April through May workable days was observed for many cases. In addition, summer drought metrics were projected to increase for most scenarios. These results highlight how the spatial and temporal variability in climate change may present unique challenges to mitigation and adaptation efforts.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>USDA-ARS</institution></funding-source><award-id>Project 3611-22000-018</award-id></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by the United States Department of Agriculture&#x02014;Agricultural Research Services Project 3611-22000-018.

In addition to the already competing challenges of feeding a growing global population and increasing environmental sustainability [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], global climate change is expected to further complicate future agricultural production and management decisions. Net socio-economic effect of climate change on agriculture will differ from region to region including both positive and negative net effects [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For example, increases in temperature may allow new cultivars that utilize longer frost-free seasons and a greater number of growing degree days (GDDs) for greater yields. On the other hand, increases in temperature increase evapotranspirative demand. If this higher atmospheric demand for water is not met by additional precipitation or irrigation, there is a potential for increases in water stress and drought. Globally, climate change is projected to have a negative impact on global food security [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>Four types of agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change have been identified: technological advances, government policy and insurance, farm production practices, and farm financial management [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Technological innovation has historically played an important role in reducing some of the risks of weather variability to agriculture [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, weather variability is still a key factor driving risks in agriculture. These risks are not limited to the effect of average weather conditions on plant growth. They also include the catastrophic effects of extreme weather, changes in field workability, and the more indirect effects on yield through the responses of pests and weeds [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Since technological advances alone have not offset the risks associated with weather variability, adaptations to climate change will require a more integrated approach. An integrated approach needs to include both adaptation by the production system and socio-economic adaptations in market risk taking and policy [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Considerable effort is now being spent on assessing these potential risks through modeling efforts [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Field operations in crop production follow a strict timeline based on the relations among soil conditions, crop developmental stages and local weather patterns. The available days suitable for agricultural operations each growing season, or field working days (FWDs), is an example of how weather variability affects risks in agriculture. These risks have economic significance and are often mitigated through a combination of management timing and machinery size selection [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The availability of FWDs is primarily driven by soil moisture, where soil moisture over a certain threshold is deemed too wet to work [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Different soils are assumed to be have the same threshold for workability if the volumetric soil moisture is measured as a percentage of either the field capacity (FC) or plastic limit (PL) of the soil [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. For example, there is theoretical justification for an optimal soil moisture threshold for tillage of 90% of the PL of a soil [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Studies looking at the implications of climate change on the U.S. Midwest from the agricultural perspective draw several consistent conclusions. Growing season length is projected to increase in both accumulation of thermal time units (GDDs) and time between last and first frost dates [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Winter and spring precipitation is consistently projected to increase in coming decades, resulting in greater soil moisture in the early season, while increased evapotranspiration will decrease soil moisture during the summer [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Wetter springs will likely make timely spring planting operations difficult and drier summers will increase drought risk [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Few recent studies explicitly model changes in field workability resulting from climate change [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], despite the clear connection between climate and field workability [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>There were two primary objectives of this study: (1) to determine the effects of projected climate change scenarios on field workability in the state of Illinois and (2) discuss how these changes may interact with projected changes in season length and water availability to influence risks caused by weather variability. Based on previous projections from climate models, we expected to see decreases in field workability due to wetter winter and springs, and greater prevalence of drought risk. We also expected temperature-driven increases in season length defined by GDDs and frost-free season. These changes were examined at two spatial scales. We use the finer resolution of the crop district scale to highlight the spatial variability associated with climate change impacts. We also present results at the broader state average scale, so that overall trends can be summarized.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Field workability data</title><p>Historical data on the weekly number of FWDs for Illinois were reported by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service at both the statewide average and crop district scale [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].

LARS-WG (version 5.0) was the stochastic weather generator used in this study because it is well suited and easy to implement for agricultural risk assessments [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. By default, LARS-WG can only generate single-site time series of daily weather. LARS-WG contains a statistical downscaling component to allow for site-specific climate change projections based on one of 14 global circulation models (GCM) used in the IPCC AR4 assessment [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While a multi-model ensemble approach would be ideal, we chose the Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCSM3) due to computation time. CCSM3 was specifically chosen because it was (1) among the highest resolution, (2) among newest available GCMs in LARS-WG, and (3) was in the middle range of climate sensitivities to atmospheric carbon [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].

The differences among scenarios (already built into LARS-WG) are complex and involve socio-economic as well as energy-use considerations, but generally the intensity of climate change is expected to be lowest in the B1 scenario, intermediate in A1B, and highest in A2.</p><p>For each region, scenario, and time period (including the baseline period), 1000 years of simulated weather was generated.

The Thornthwaite equation is among the simplest models for PET as it only requires temperature and latitude and is based on empirical, rather than mechanistic, model fitting [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. A more advanced methodology for calculating PET, such as the Penman-Monteith equation, would be ideal. However, such calculations would require inputs (eg. cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity) not available as outputs of LARS-WG. Using the Thornthwaite equation allowed for the calculation of PET with only the output available from LARS-WG. In addition, there is evidence that at monthly and yearly timescales, the Thornthwaite equation performs similarly to the Penman-Monteith equation in both qualitative and quantitative measures of drought in this region [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].

A few significant differences were detected between training period and simulated weather characteristics in the simulated heat waves, defined as runs of days with temperatures over 30&#x000b0;C, particularly in spring. However, these p-values could change in significance based on the random seed of the generated weather. This indicates discrepancies in the distribution of simulated and observed heat waves may be partly caused by randomness, since these events are rare in the data. The output from LARS-WG was further validated by comparing historical FWD probabilities from USDA-NASS reports to those simulated in the baseline period by LARS-WG. LARS-WG and the optimized field workability model perform exceptionally well (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.95) at reproducing the historical statewide average field workability probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Validating on the crop district level, the procedure performed well in five of the nine districts and but has some biases in the remaining four (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0172301.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). One explanation is that the spatial variability of weather patterns in these districts may be poorly represented by the representative weather site.

This small increase, coupled with the robust projection of an earlier last frost date, may allow farmers to plant earlier. On the other hand, with the exception of the mid-century A1B scenario, the average number of cumulative April through May FWDs is projected to remain stable or decrease. Projected constraints on mid-spring FWDs are consistent with previous studies projecting higher spring soil moisture caused by increased spring rainfall [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This pattern of decreased field workability is especially pronounced in scenarios for southern Illinois. Less FWDs could make timely field operations more difficult in comparison to the northern part of the state. These changes in field workability may necessitate regional changes in crop choice; variation in field workability has been identified as a driver in the spatial distribution of cropping practices in Europe [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Extremely wet conditions during planting have also been shown to negatively affect maize and soybean yields in the U.S. Corn Belt [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. As a result, cropping practices which allow for more flexible management timing or possess smaller yield potential penalties for delayed spring field operations may become more attractive for the risk-adverse.</p><p>Another clear pattern is an increase in probability, severity, and spatial extent of drought risk. Despite the simplicity of the modeling approach and the underlying Thornthwaite PET equation, these results mirror previous research projecting a decrease in summer soil moisture driven largely by increases in evapotranspiration and run-off [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. These results also concur with recent efforts using newer climate scenarios and GCMs [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Specifically, the higher emission scenarios (A1B and A2) show more districts with drought risks, and a higher probability of drought risks from the mid-century to the end of the century. This concurs with the projected temperature increases between the middle and end of the century in all scenarios [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, we note that this increase in drought risk is primarily driven by changes to ET. As a result, some of this projected risk could be alleviated by ET-driven precipitation recycling [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Irrigation could allow upwind sources to provide increases in precipitation to Illinois in the future that are not accounted for in CCSM3 [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Further, even without irrigation this potential source of additional precipitation could be influenced by land-use strategies [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. This notion of precipitation recycling represents yet another source of uncertainty in our forecasts. As our understanding of this feedback improves, there is a potential for this knowledge to be used to improve long-term weather and field workability forecasts [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>].</p><p>Previous modeling efforts have shown increases in weather variability are likely to be associated with decreases in maize yields over most of the state, and these changes interacted with GDD day requirements [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. The widening quantile range in the cumulative water balance for the most climate change scenarios in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g004">Fig 4</xref> shows such an increase in variability. Considering water availability as a cumulative time series confers another advantage when viewed on a monthly temporal resolution. This perspective highlights risk of increased drought, relative to the baseline scenario, concentrated at the end of the summer. At the state level, this drought risk is evident both earlier in the season, and generally at higher intensity under all of the scenarios.</p><p>Given that drought stress can account for a significant proportion of historical average yield losses in U.S. maize, improvements in water-stress tolerance through breeding have an opportunity to play an important role in reducing yield variability [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. However, even increases in drought tolerance at the individual plant level might not always translate into increased average yields due to increased sowing densities typical of modern field crop production [<xref rid="pone.0172301.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Understanding how these factors will contribute to regional-scale agricultural productivity also requires knowledge of interactions between changes in field workability and drought risks.</p><p>Our analysis indicates that early planting operations in late March and early April may be facilitated by increases in field workability and a retreating spring frost date. From a management perspective, this earlier planting might allow for risk mitigation by allowing critical growth stages (i.e., reproductive stages) to precede the most severe periods of drought risk present in the late summer. Operations dependent on April and May FWDs may be impaired in some districts. This is particularly true under more intense scenarios such as A2 where substantial increases in drought risk are often coupled with decreases in field workability.</p><p>We identified three potential responses proposed by these projections that decision-makers might consider as part of a climate-resilient agricultural production strategy. First, plant longer maturity cultivars that match the new season length in terms of GDDs and frost dates. Aided by an increase in late March and early April FWDs, potential yield may be enhanced by cultivars utilizing this longer season. However, this greater yield potential may be difficult to realize under more frequent and intense drought risk. Second, plant early, but instead select a shorter-season cultivar to reduce the risk of encountering late-summer drought conditions at reproductive stages. This response trades maximum possible return (and likely average return) for a decrease in yield variability. Finally, adopt agronomic management practices that conserve soil moisture and select crops with greater drought tolerance. This response would require the greatest changes from contemporary practices and as such is the most extreme mitigation response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec014"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The key conclusion of this study is that specific impacts of climate change on weather and crop production are likely to be highly variable across Illinois. Specifically related to our study objectives, we have shown that climate change projections suggest changes to (1) the timing and number of workability and (2) the availability of water and drought risk. Even at scales smaller than the state level, significant differences in the magnitude and direction of projected changes were observed. Changes were highly dependent on the greenhouse gas emissions scenario forcing climate change. In general, we projected an increasing trend in the frequency and spatial extent of drought risk through years and across all but the least severe scenario (B1). Models also predict a high level of variability in changes to field workability. Warmer spring temperatures may allow for a few more FWDs in late March and early April under most scenarios. However, the average number of overall FWDs between April and May show large decreases in several crop districts and scenarios. Only one scenario (A1B, mid-century) shows an increase in April to May FWDs. To conclude, changes in weather-related risks caused by global climate change will likely force changes in management practices; either indirectly through the adoption of mitigation strategies, or directly by modifying the availability of workable days.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec015"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172301.s001"><label>S1 Equation</label><caption><title>The Thornthwaite equation for monthly PET.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172301.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172301.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Regional daily soil moisture threshold determined by optimization over day of year for field workability.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172301.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172301.s003"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Regional daily mid-range temperature threshold determined by optimization over day of year for field workability.</title><p>The temperatures thresholds are constrained between 0 and 10&#x000b0; C.</p><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0172301.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0172301.s004"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Goodness of fit of the simulated probability of field working day for each crop reporting district.</title><p>Predictions are made from weather data trained on 1960&#x02013;2000 from LARS-WG (black line).
