  <title class="title">Simulated cumulative average water balance of Illinois crop reporting districts as calculated using the Thornthwaite equation for potential evapotranspiration.</title>
  <p class="p">Water balance is calculated at the end of each month with a linear interpolation between months. The black line indicates the average monthly cumulative water balance. Grey lines indicate the average 95
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 5
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> quantiles of monthly cumulative water balance with area in which the lower quantile goes below zero marked with red polygons. The dotted vertical lines indicate that 90
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile fall and spring frost dates. Mean growing degree days calculated in degrees Celsius allowing maximum daily temperature of 30°C and minimum daily temperature of 10°C.
