  <title class="title">Simulated cumulative average water balance of Illinois.</title>
  <p class="p">Potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the Thornthwaite equation. All values are calculated as the mean of the individual district mean values with water balance calculated at the end of each month with a linear interpolation between months. The black line indicates the average monthly cumulative water balance. Grey lines indicate the average 95
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> and 5
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> quantiles of monthly cumulative water balance with area in which the lower quantile goes below zero marked with red polygons. The dotted vertical lines identify the 90
   <sup class="sup">th</sup> percentile fall and spring frost dates. Mean GDDs were calculated in degrees Celsius with maximum daily temperature of 30°C and minimum daily temperature of 10°C.
