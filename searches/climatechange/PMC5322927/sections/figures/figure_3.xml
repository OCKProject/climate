  <title class="title">Changes in the number of months in deficit between May and August to the baseline simulation period of 1960â€“2000 for three different climate change scenarios.</title>
  <p class="p">Projections are driven by NCAR CCSM3 and downscaled using LARS-WG. Each district contains 1000 years of simulation for each scenario and time horizon. Field working day changes are relative changes in mean number of April through May field working days from the simulated baseline. Arrows pointing up indicate an increase in average number of field working days while those pointing down indicate a decrease.</p>
