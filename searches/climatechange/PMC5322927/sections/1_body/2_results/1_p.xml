<p class="p">The LARS-WG diagnostics indicated that nearly all of the simulated weather characteristics had similar distributions to the training data. A few significant differences were detected between training period and simulated weather characteristics in the simulated heat waves, defined as runs of days with temperatures over 30Â°C, particularly in spring. However, these p-values could change in significance based on the random seed of the generated weather. This indicates discrepancies in the distribution of simulated and observed heat waves may be partly caused by randomness, since these events are rare in the data. The output from LARS-WG was further validated by comparing historical FWD probabilities from USDA-NASS reports to those simulated in the baseline period by LARS-WG. LARS-WG and the optimized field workability model perform exceptionally well (R

One explanation is that the spatial variability of weather patterns in these districts may be poorly represented by the representative weather site. While these four districts do contain some biases, the biases are relatively small (&lt;10% per day on average), vary in sign, and occur at different points in the season which indicate that any errors are not systematic issues introduced by the modeling approach.
