<p class="p">Under the B1 emissions scenario, state average field workability is expected to experience a small increase in late March workability but otherwise remain similar to historical levels (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). This increase is especially prevalent in the Northwest district with an additional 6 April-May FWDs projected on average. Conversely, the simulated probability of workable days under the A2 scenario is projected to be about 10% lower between the last two weeks of April and first two weeks of May. This decrease owes to the sharp decrease in average April and May FWDs forecasted for the districts in the southern half of Illinois (
