<p class="p">The combination of earlier last spring frosts (minimum daily temperatures &lt; 0°C) and later first fall frosts are projected to add 20–30 additional days to the length of the growing season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). A combination of this longer season and rising daily temperatures correspond to an increase in GDDs. Averaged over the state, these increases range from an additional 350 GDDs Celsius under B1 to an additional 600 GDDs under A2. These projections are similar to previous results for the U.S. Midwest even when different GCMs were used in the downscaling process [
