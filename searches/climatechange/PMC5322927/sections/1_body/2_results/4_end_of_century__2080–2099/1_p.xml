<p class="p">By the end of century, different climate scenarios diverge considerably. Under the less intense scenarios of B1 and A1B, only 50–100 GDDs are added to the state average from the Mid-Century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>). Under A2, the earlier last spring frost is responsible for most of the 1–2 week increase in the length of the season, corresponding to a 300 GDD increase from the mid-century value. Compared to the baseline period, these changes represent a 3–8 week increase in season length and 500–900 additional GDDs depending on the scenario.
