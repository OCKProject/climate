<p class="p">Our simulations consistently predicted an increase in late March and early April field workability. This small increase, coupled with the robust projection of an earlier last frost date, may allow farmers to plant earlier. On the other hand, with the exception of the mid-century A1B scenario, the average number of cumulative April through May FWDs is projected to remain stable or decrease. Projected constraints on mid-spring FWDs are consistent with previous studies projecting higher spring soil moisture caused by increased spring rainfall [

Less FWDs could make timely field operations more difficult in comparison to the northern part of the state. These changes in field workability may necessitate regional changes in crop choice; variation in field workability has been identified as a driver in the spatial distribution of cropping practices in Europe [

 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. As a result, cropping practices which allow for more flexible management timing or possess smaller yield potential penalties for delayed spring field operations may become more attractive for the risk-adverse.
