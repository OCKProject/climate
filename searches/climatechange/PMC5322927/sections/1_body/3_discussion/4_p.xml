<p class="p">Given that drought stress can account for a significant proportion of historical average yield losses in U.S. maize, improvements in water-stress tolerance through breeding have an opportunity to play an important role in reducing yield variability [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. However, even increases in drought tolerance at the individual plant level might not always translate into increased average yields due to increased sowing densities typical of modern field crop production [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Understanding how these factors will contribute to regional-scale agricultural productivity also requires knowledge of interactions between changes in field workability and drought risks.
