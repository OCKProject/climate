<p class="p">Another clear pattern is an increase in probability, severity, and spatial extent of drought risk. Despite the simplicity of the modeling approach and the underlying Thornthwaite PET equation, these results mirror previous research projecting a decrease in summer soil moisture driven largely by increases in evapotranspiration and run-off [

 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. Specifically, the higher emission scenarios (A1B and A2) show more districts with drought risks, and a higher probability of drought risks from the mid-century to the end of the century. This concurs with the projected temperature increases between the middle and end of the century in all scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. However, we note that this increase in drought risk is primarily driven by changes to ET. As a result, some of this projected risk could be alleviated by ET-driven precipitation recycling [

As our understanding of this feedback improves, there is a potential for this knowledge to be used to improve long-term weather and field workability forecasts [
