<p class="p">Our analysis indicates that early planting operations in late March and early April may be facilitated by increases in field workability and a retreating spring frost date. From a management perspective, this earlier planting might allow for risk mitigation by allowing critical growth stages (i.e., reproductive stages) to precede the most severe periods of drought risk present in the late summer. Operations dependent on April and May FWDs may be impaired in some districts. This is particularly true under more intense scenarios such as A2 where substantial increases in drought risk are often coupled with decreases in field workability.</p>
