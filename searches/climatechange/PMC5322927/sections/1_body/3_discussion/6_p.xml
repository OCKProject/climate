<p class="p">We identified three potential responses proposed by these projections that decision-makers might consider as part of a climate-resilient agricultural production strategy. First, plant longer maturity cultivars that match the new season length in terms of GDDs and frost dates. Aided by an increase in late March and early April FWDs, potential yield may be enhanced by cultivars utilizing this longer season. However, this greater yield potential may be difficult to realize under more frequent and intense drought risk. Second, plant early, but instead select a shorter-season cultivar to reduce the risk of encountering late-summer drought conditions at reproductive stages. This response trades maximum possible return (and likely average return) for a decrease in yield variability. Finally, adopt agronomic management practices that conserve soil moisture and select crops with greater drought tolerance. This response would require the greatest changes from contemporary practices and as such is the most extreme mitigation response.</p>
