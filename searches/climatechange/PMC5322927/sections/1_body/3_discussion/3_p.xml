 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172301.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> shows such an increase in variability. Considering water availability as a cumulative time series confers another advantage when viewed on a monthly temporal resolution. This perspective highlights risk of increased drought, relative to the baseline scenario, concentrated at the end of the summer. At the state level, this drought risk is evident both earlier in the season, and generally at higher intensity under all of the scenarios.
