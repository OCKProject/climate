<p class="p">Agriculture faces considerable challenges over the next century. In addition to the already competing challenges of feeding a growing global population and increasing environmental sustainability [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>], global climate change is expected to further complicate future agricultural production and management decisions. Net socio-economic effect of climate change on agriculture will differ from region to region including both positive and negative net effects [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. For example, increases in temperature may allow new cultivars that utilize longer frost-free seasons and a greater number of growing degree days (GDDs) for greater yields. On the other hand, increases in temperature increase evapotranspirative demand. If this higher atmospheric demand for water is not met by additional precipitation or irrigation, there is a potential for increases in water stress and drought. Globally, climate change is projected to have a negative impact on global food security [
