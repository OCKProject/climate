<p class="p">There were two primary objectives of this study: (1) to determine the effects of projected climate change scenarios on field workability in the state of Illinois and (2) discuss how these changes may interact with projected changes in season length and water availability to influence risks caused by weather variability. Based on previous projections from climate models, we expected to see decreases in field workability due to wetter winter and springs, and greater prevalence of drought risk. We also expected temperature-driven increases in season length defined by GDDs and frost-free season. These changes were examined at two spatial scales. We use the finer resolution of the crop district scale to highlight the spatial variability associated with climate change impacts. We also present results at the broader state average scale, so that overall trends can be summarized.</p>
