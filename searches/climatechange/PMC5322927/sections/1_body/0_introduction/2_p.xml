<p class="p">Four types of agricultural adaptation strategies to climate change have been identified: technological advances, government policy and insurance, farm production practices, and farm financial management [

 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, weather variability is still a key factor driving risks in agriculture. These risks are not limited to the effect of average weather conditions on plant growth. They also include the catastrophic effects of extreme weather, changes in field workability, and the more indirect effects on yield through the responses of pests and weeds [

 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Since technological advances alone have not offset the risks associated with weather variability, adaptations to climate change will require a more integrated approach. An integrated approach needs to include both adaptation by the production system and socio-economic adaptations in market risk taking and policy [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Considerable effort is now being spent on assessing these potential risks through modeling efforts [
