<p class="p">Studies looking at the implications of climate change on the U.S. Midwest from the agricultural perspective draw several consistent conclusions. Growing season length is projected to increase in both accumulation of thermal time units (GDDs) and time between last and first frost dates [

 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Winter and spring precipitation is consistently projected to increase in coming decades, resulting in greater soil moisture in the early season, while increased evapotranspiration will decrease soil moisture during the summer [
