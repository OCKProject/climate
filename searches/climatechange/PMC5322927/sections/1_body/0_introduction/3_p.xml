<p class="p">Field operations in crop production follow a strict timeline based on the relations among soil conditions, crop developmental stages and local weather patterns. The available days suitable for agricultural operations each growing season, or field working days (FWDs), is an example of how weather variability affects risks in agriculture. These risks have economic significance and are often mitigated through a combination of management timing and machinery size selection [
