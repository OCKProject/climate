<p class="p">The key conclusion of this study is that specific impacts of climate change on weather and crop production are likely to be highly variable across Illinois. Specifically related to our study objectives, we have shown that climate change projections suggest changes to (1) the timing and number of workability and (2) the availability of water and drought risk. Even at scales smaller than the state level, significant differences in the magnitude and direction of projected changes were observed. Changes were highly dependent on the greenhouse gas emissions scenario forcing climate change. In general, we projected an increasing trend in the frequency and spatial extent of drought risk through years and across all but the least severe scenario (B1). Models also predict a high level of variability in changes to field workability. Warmer spring temperatures may allow for a few more FWDs in late March and early April under most scenarios. However, the average number of overall FWDs between April and May show large decreases in several crop districts and scenarios. Only one scenario (A1B, mid-century) shows an increase in April to May FWDs. To conclude, changes in weather-related risks caused by global climate change will likely force changes in management practices; either indirectly through the adoption of mitigation strategies, or directly by modifying the availability of workable days.</p>
