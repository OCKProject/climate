<p class="p">In the case of the LARS-WG output for the climate change scenarios, there is only one station per each crop district (a total of nine). The weather stations not included are assumed to have the same weather as the representative station from their corresponding district. This is a simplification, which underestimates the spatial variability within a crop district, but allows for all the soils to be used.</p>
