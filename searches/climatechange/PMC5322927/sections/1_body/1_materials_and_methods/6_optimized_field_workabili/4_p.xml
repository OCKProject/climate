<p class="p">The procedure was improved to eliminate trends in the prediction error over day of year. Within-season trends in errors were eliminated by splitting the training data into two time periods to create a trending threshold for workability. Period one included weekly reports issued before day of year (DOY) 105, and period two included reports between DOY 105 and 150. The resulting optimal soil moisture and temperature thresholds for the two periods were connected with a simple trend line fit from DOY 105 to 150 and extrapolated past these points (
