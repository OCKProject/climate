<p class="p">The number of FWDs predicted within each district was computed as the average number of FWDs predicted at each weather station in that district. Weather station scale FWDs were predicted as the average number of FWDs predicted for each of the soils associated with that station. An optimization procedure was used to identify the field workability threshold in terms of PL using the reported workable days. Different soil moisture and temperature thresholds were tested iteratively to minimize the squared prediction error of the USDA-NASS reported FWDs.</p>
