<p class="p">Weather time series were also simulated using the weather generator LARS-WG [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. For the analysis used to train LARS-WG, one station was selected from each crop district as a representative of the conditions for that district. The LARS-WG training period selected extended from 1960 to 2000 with the exception of the Northeast and Central districts starting in 1967 and 1978 respectively. Each station was the one with the lowest average pairwise squared difference in daily precipitation values from all other stations in that district.
