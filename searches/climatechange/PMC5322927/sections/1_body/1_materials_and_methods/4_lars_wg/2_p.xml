<p class="p">CCSM3 projections for two different time periods (2046–2065 and 2080–2099) and three different IPCC emissions scenarios B1, A1B, and A2 were used [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. The differences among scenarios (already built into LARS-WG) are complex and involve socio-economic as well as energy-use considerations, but generally the intensity of climate change is expected to be lowest in the B1 scenario, intermediate in A1B, and highest in A2.
