<p class="p">Stochastic weather generators are models capable of analyzing historical weather time series and simulating new and independent weather time series which is statistically similar to the training (baseline) period [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. LARS-WG (version 5.0) was the stochastic weather generator used in this study because it is well suited and easy to implement for agricultural risk assessments [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. By default, LARS-WG can only generate single-site time series of daily weather. LARS-WG contains a statistical downscaling component to allow for site-specific climate change projections based on one of 14 global circulation models (GCM) used in the IPCC AR4 assessment [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. While a multi-model ensemble approach would be ideal, we chose the Community Climate Model Version 3 (CCSM3) due to computation time. CCSM3 was specifically chosen because it was (1) among the highest resolution, (2) among newest available GCMs in LARS-WG, and (3) was in the middle range of climate sensitivities to atmospheric carbon [
