<p class="p">The drought measure used in this study is the monthly precipitation minus the PET (hereafter called the water balance). This monthly measure is drawn as an accumulation initialized at zero over each year in

All results are comparisons relative to the simulations from baseline weather conditions. In this way, we make effort in controlling the effects of modeling assumptions.
