 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. The Thornthwaite equation is among the simplest models for PET as it only requires temperature and latitude and is based on empirical, rather than mechanistic, model fitting [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. A more advanced methodology for calculating PET, such as the Penman-Monteith equation, would be ideal. However, such calculations would require inputs (eg. cloudiness, wind speed, and humidity) not available as outputs of LARS-WG. Using the Thornthwaite equation allowed for the calculation of PET with only the output available from LARS-WG. In addition, there is evidence that at monthly and yearly timescales, the Thornthwaite equation performs similarly to the Penman-Monteith equation in both qualitative and quantitative measures of drought in this region [
 <xref rid="pone.0172301.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. For these reasons, this simple equation is still used with success as a component in some climatological drought metrics, especially when data is limited [
