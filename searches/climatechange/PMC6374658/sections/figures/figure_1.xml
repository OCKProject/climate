  <p class="p">Seasonal variations in mean population body masses for adult (orange lines) and juvenile (blue lines) tits (monthly means and standard error bars). (a) Blue tits; (b) coal tits; (c) great tits. More than 12Â months are included for (a) and (c) because the juvenile age class begins with individuals recorded as age 3 and then comprises individuals recorded as age 5 after December. There were fewer records for coal tits than for the other investigated species, and there were thus insufficient data for juveniles in May and June to allow those months to be plotted. Standard error bars are shown but are extremely small due to the large sample sizes</p>
