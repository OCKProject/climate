  <p class="p">Linear regression coefficients of wing length in relation to year for all months, species, and age classes. Coefficients are significantly lower than zero for all species and both age classes in at least 7 months of the year and are not significantly higher than zero for any species or age class in any month. Coefficients significantly different from zero are presented as circles; coefficients not significantly different from zero are presented as triangles. “Long‐term rate of change” refers to the rate of change between the same month in one year and the next and does not reflect within‐year rate of change, as might be observed from one month to the next</p>
