  <p class="p">Linear regression coefficients of body mass in relation to year for all months, species and age classes. Coefficients that are significantly different from zero are presented as circles; coefficients that are not significantly different from zero are presented as triangles. Parabolic curves are fitted to each species–age class combination. “Long‐term rate of change” refers to the rate of change between the same month in one year and the next and does not reflect within‐year rate of change, as might be observed from one month to the next</p>
