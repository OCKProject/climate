<p class="p">A linear model was produced to identify the mechanisms responsible for the observed long‐term trends in body mass. Each body mass record was transformed into a standard deviation from the mean mass for that species and age class to allow standardized comparisons between groups. Temperatures and sparrowhawk abundances were also standardized. Based on visual similarity between the December and January datasets and among the three study species, data from all three species and both age classes in December and January were then pooled to produce a midwinter dataset, making the assumption that approximately the same pressures would be acting on each age class and species. A linear model was then fitted to determine the effects of year of capture (centered on the year 2000), mean monthly UK temperature in the year of capture (MET Office,

 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) on the standardized mass of the captured individuals. All variables were added both separately and as pairwise interactions, and the “dredge” function (Bartoń, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) was used to compare models to determine which model had the strongest Akaike information criterion (AIC) support. The three‐way interaction between all variables was not included, as it is difficult to justify biologically.
