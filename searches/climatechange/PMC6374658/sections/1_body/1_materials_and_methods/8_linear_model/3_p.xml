<p class="p">Although wing length is likely to have a major impact on individual body mass (because wing length acts as a proxy for body size, and larger birds are typically heavier; Gosler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), wing length was omitted from this model because mean population wing length is liable to change over time in response to changing wing‚Äêloading demands driven by changes in body mass. Consequently, inclusion of wing length in the model would be liable to mask the effects of other factors on bird body mass.
