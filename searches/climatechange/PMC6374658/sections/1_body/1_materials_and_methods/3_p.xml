<p class="p">Individual birds were assigned to one of two age classes (adult or juvenile) based on the BTO ringing code assigned at capture. Juveniles were defined as birds of age 0, and adults were defined as birds of ages greater than 0. Birds not confirmed to be of age 0 between January 1st and June 30th were omitted from the analysis because they could potentially have been either juveniles hatched in the previous calendar year, or adults.</p>
