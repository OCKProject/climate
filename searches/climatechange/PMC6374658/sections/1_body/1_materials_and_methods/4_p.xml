<p class="p">Data processing was performed using the Matlab computing program (Mathworks, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Subsequent statistical analyses were performed in R (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Analysis was divided into four sections: (a) A preliminary analysis of within‐year changes in body mass, to ensure that all three investigated species displayed similar patterns of body mass change and were therefore likely affected by the same environmental factors, (b) Identification of the trend in long‐term change in body mass, (c) Identification of the trend in long‐term change in wing length and (d) A linear model correlating long‐term changes in body mass with changes in environmental factors.
