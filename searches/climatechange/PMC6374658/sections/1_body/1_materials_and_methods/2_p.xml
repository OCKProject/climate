<p class="p">Data were collected by the British and Irish Ringing Scheme run by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), which recorded 932,722 captures of blue tits (514,235), coal tits (99,737), and great tits (318,751) in Britain and Ireland between 1965 and 2017 in which both body mass and wing length were recorded. Initial inspection of the data indicated that 16 measurements were likely to be erroneous (outside the plausible range of values), and these were therefore removed from the subsequent analysis. The remaining measurements were then sorted by month and year of capture, and multiple captures of the same individual within the same month and year were combined to reduce multiple counting of individuals, leaving 452,599 blue tits, 76,743 coal tits, and 271,641 great tits.</p>
