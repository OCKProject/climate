<p class="p">A linear regression of body mass against year was performed for each species, age class, and month to reveal any long‐term changes in body mass since the 1960s. We used these regressions to fit curves for each species and age class to describe seasonal differences in long‐term rates of change of the mean population body mass. One possibility is that apparent changes in body mass over time may be accounted for by changes in average timing of ringing over the study period, interacting with changes in bird body mass over the course of a day. To test this, a liner regression was performed for juvenile blue tits in January, including only birds caught at noon.</p>
