<p class="p">Linear regressions revealed that mean wing length decreased in both age classes and all investigated species (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34812-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Both age classes in all three species showed significant decreases (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in mean population wing lengths in at least 7 of the 12 months of the year, and neither age class in any species showed a significant increase in mean wing length in any month of the year. These rates of decrease in mean wing length showed far less seasonality than the corresponding rates of decrease in mean population body mass.
