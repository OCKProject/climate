<p class="p">The linear regressions of individual body mass against year (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34812-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref> in Supporting information for an example) revealed that body mass decreased in both age classes and all investigated species during a substantial proportion of the year, centered on winter (significant year‐to‐year population body mass decreases (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in all species and age classes in the months between November and March inclusive) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34812-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The highest rates of decrease occurred in December and January (Table
