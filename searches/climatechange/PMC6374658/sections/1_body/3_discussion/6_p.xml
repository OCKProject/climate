<p class="p">Finally, increasing levels of human supplementary feeding of garden bird species across Britain (Plummer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) may also reduce the energy‐storage benefit of body fat to birds during the winter by increasing the reliability of food availability, which may also lead to a reduction in optimal body mass in response to constant predation risk. We also demonstrated a relationship between winter body mass and calendar year that was independent of the effect of winter temperature or sparrowhawk abundance, suggesting that a long‐term increase in supplementary feeding of garden birds (Plummer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) may also have influenced the trade‐off between starvation risk and predation risk.
