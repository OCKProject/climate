<p class="p">The interaction terms including an effect of year indicated a decline in the magnitudes of the effects of both temperature and sparrowhawk abundance over time. The interaction between sparrowhawk abundance and temperature indicated that an increase in one increased the magnitude of the effect of the other. This also supports existing theories: fat gain represents a trade‚Äêoff between predation risk and energy storage (Krams et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). Consequently, when the costs of fat gain (in terms of increased predation risk) are very low (e.g., because sparrowhawk abundance is low), there is less pressure to maintain a low body mass when possible (e.g., at higher temperatures where energy reserves are less important), and body mass would thus be predicted to respond less to temperature when sparrowhawk abundance is low, as observed.
