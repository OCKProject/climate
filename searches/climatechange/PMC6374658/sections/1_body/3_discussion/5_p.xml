<p class="p">Optimal body mass could also be reduced by increased predation pressure (Gosler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>), even in the absence of changes in temperature. However, the sparrowhawk is one of the main predators of all three tit species (Perrins, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1979</xref>), and sparrowhawk abundance in Britain plateaued in the 1990s (Robinson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), when the population recovered from the negative effects of the pesticide DDT after its use was banned in Britain in 1984 (Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>). Furthermore, increasing predator abundance cannot explain why prey body mass would only decrease in winter, given that although passerine food availability is likely to vary with season, their predators must hunt at all times of the year.
