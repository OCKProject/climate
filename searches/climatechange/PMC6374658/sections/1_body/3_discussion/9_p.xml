<p class="p">The observed reduction in wing length in all the investigated species is likely to represent a response to the reduced optimal body mass, given that individuals with larger mass require longer wings to maintain their wing loading (Andrews, Mackenzie, &amp; Gregory, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Although the reduction in body mass was only evident in the winter, individuals cannot manipulate their wing length physiologically to the same degree as their body mass, and wing length should thus be optimized to the mean body mass throughout the year, or to a weighted mean if selection on wing length is more intense at certain times of year than at others. Mean population wing length may thus be expected to decrease significantly from year to year in response to changes in body mass, as shown by our data, even in months when the mean population body mass does not decrease.
