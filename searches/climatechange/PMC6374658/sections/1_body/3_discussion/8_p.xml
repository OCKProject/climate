<p class="p">Wing length is under genetic control (Lessells &amp; Ovenden, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>), and long‐term changes in mean population wing lengths could thus be the result of evolution. For any individual bird, wing length changes over the course of a year are predictable and are caused by a combination of feather wear at the wingtips (Vágási, Pap, Tökölyi, Székely, &amp; Barta, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and molting. Although wing length is unlikely to be influenced by daily or even monthly plastic regulation, it could theoretically be influenced by yearly plastic regulation if the physical properties of the feathers change adaptively during molting to optimize them for the environment in which the bird “predicts”; it is likely to exist in the coming year. However, there is currently no evidence for such a process and therefore we suggest that the observed reduction in wing length in all three species is the result of short‐timescale evolution.
