<p class="p">Previous studies showed that great tits have undergone an evolutionary change in bill morphology in response to human supplementary feeding (Bosse et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and that populations are often locally adapted to climate, even on quite small scales (Morrison, Robinson, &amp; Pearce‐Higgins, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). It is now well known that human activities impose sufficient selection pressures on some wild species to allow evolution on directly observable timescales (Allendorf, England, Luikart, Ritchie, &amp; Ryman, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Short‐timescale evolution could thus be responsible for the observed changes in other aspects of tit morphology. However, it is also possible that the changes observed here are attributable to individuals’ plastic regulation of their body mass in response to changing environmental conditions (Gosler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>).
