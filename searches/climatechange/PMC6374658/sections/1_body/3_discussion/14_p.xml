<p class="p">This study was limited by the coarse scale of measurement of data. Consequently, our findings warrant further detailed research to examine the effects of climate change at smaller scales, and to clarify the effects of other potential factors that could affect optimal body mass in birds, such as levels of supplementary feeding. Some proportion of the observed change in bird body mass over time also appears to be accounted for by a change in the timing of bird capture, with captures becoming, on average, earlier in the day in more recent years. This can be regarded as an artifact. Further studies are also needed to determine to what degree the observed pattern is reflected in other countries and ringing schemes, and in bird species less dependent on garden feeders in winter.</p>
