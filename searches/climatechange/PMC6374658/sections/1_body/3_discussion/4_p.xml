<p class="p">Regarding longer‐term changes, body mass decreased only in the winter months in all three species and both age classes. Some of this change may be accounted for by change in the mean capture times of birds. However, much of it is not. There are several possible explanations for this unexplained change. Temperatures are currently increasing across Britain due to global warming (Jenkins et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), and the energy‐storage benefit of body fat to birds during the winter may thus be decreasing, leading to a lower optimal winter body mass in response to constant predation risk. The current analysis showed that winter temperature had a strong effect on body mass in all three species, with birds being lighter in warmer winters, which supports this hypothesis.
