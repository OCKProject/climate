<p class="p">Large, pre‐existing datasets are an underutilized resource in ecology, and with some exceptions (McLean, Jeugd, &amp; Pol, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) are rarely exploited to their full potential. The current study demonstrates the ability of data, gathered with no specific hypotheses in mind, to test specific hypotheses. Our results using such a dataset provide the first evidence for significant declines in the winter body masses of three common garden bird species throughout Britain and Ireland over the last 50 years, with annual variations correlated with climate warming. Such trends are thus liable to persist if winters continue to become warmer due to climate change, and studies in other taxa have demonstrated the potential for changes in population mean body mass to influence ecosystem functioning (Audzijonyte, Kuparinen, &amp; Fulton, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and life histories (Kuparinen &amp; Hutchings, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Consequently, our results represent an important point of consideration for conservation and future ecological studies.
