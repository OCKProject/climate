<p class="p">The linear model used to determine the factors influencing body mass was somewhat crude, in that the temperature and sparrowhawk abundance predictor variables were averaged over large areas and may therefore not always be correct for the individual birds in the sample (which will be affected by local temperatures and predator abundances). However, the use of sparrowhawk abundance data from England was justified given that most of the birds (812,252 of 933,024 captures) in the analysis were recorded in England.</p>
