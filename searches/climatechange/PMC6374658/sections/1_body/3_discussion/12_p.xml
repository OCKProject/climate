<p class="p">It is possible that the significant decrease in bird body mass over time independent of temperature or sparrowhawk abundance may be an artifact resulting from the coarse scales of the measurements of temperature and sparrowhawk abundance. However, it is also possible that the decrease may be at least partly due to other variables, such as the level of supplementary feeding, which has been increasing in Britain and Ireland (Plummer et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and which provides a reliable winter food source for many passerine species, reducing the benefits of additional body fat for energy storage and therefore reducing their optimal winter body mass.
