It is therefore reasonable to expect that all three species could be affected similarly by changes in climate, predation risk, and other factors such as supplementary feeding practices, which have been shown to affect the phenotypes of garden birds (Plummer, Bearhop, Leech, Chamberlain, &amp; Blount, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>). Because small bird species in temperate climates rely on temperature as a cue for regulating body mass (Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1969</xref>), anthropogenic increases in the mean winter temperature are likely to lead to predictable decreases in mean winter body mass in small birds. However, these changes may be quite small and long term, and therefore not easy to observe without access to large datasets.
