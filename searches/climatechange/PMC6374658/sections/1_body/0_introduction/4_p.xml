<p class="p">Sparrowhawk abundance in Britain was severely reduced by organochlorine pesticide poisoning in the 1960s (Newton, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1986</xref>); however, the population recovered rapidly after the regulation of these pesticides and has since plateaued (Robinson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). This recovery coincided with a significant drop in body mass among great tits, which occurred in specific regions at the same time as sparrowhawk populations recovered in those regions (Gosler et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1995</xref>). Increases in sparrowhawk abundance across Britain might therefore also be expected to coincide with a decrease in body mass of tits.
