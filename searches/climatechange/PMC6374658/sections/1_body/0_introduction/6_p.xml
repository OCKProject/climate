<p class="p">In this study, we used the huge long‐term datasets generated by citizen science bird ringing in Britain and Ireland to analyze seasonal and long‐term changes in mean adult and juvenile body masses in three abundant tit populations (blue tits, great tits, and coal tits) and correlated these with published, UK‐wide sparrowhawk abundances and publicly available temperature data, to determine the possible mechanisms responsible for these changes in body mass. We also examined long‐term variations in the wing lengths of these birds to test the hypothesis that changes in body mass may be accompanied by compensatory changes in wing length.</p>
