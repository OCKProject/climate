<p class="p">Supplementary feeding of garden birds has increased in recent decades, with notable effects on the ecologies of some species, such as the Eurasian blackcap 
 <italic class="italic">Sylvia atricapilla</italic> (Plummer, Siriwardena, Conway, Risely, &amp; Toms, 
 <xref rid="ece34812-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Supplementary feeding increases food availability and predictability, especially in winter, and would therefore be expected to lead small birds such as tits to downregulate their winter fat deposits, thus reducing their winter body mass.
