  <p class="p">(a) The least‐cost path and corridors between current and future suitable habitats, least‐cost corridors truncated at cost distance of 200,000 cost units. (b) Climate refugia and corridors where priority conservation efforts could be focused. The potential corridor areas numbered 1, 2, and 3 are the more critical areas for current movements and tracking climate change. The corridor areas numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7 are more critical under future conditions</p>
