 <xref rid="ece34815-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1</xref>) contributed the most to the model, according to the permutation importance, followed by the precipitation seasonality (bio15, 21.9%), settlement density (10.4%), vegetation type (4.6%), road density (4.1%), river density (0.7%), and min temperature of the coldest month (bio06, 0.6%). The average threshold value for the measure of suitable habitat was 0.185.
