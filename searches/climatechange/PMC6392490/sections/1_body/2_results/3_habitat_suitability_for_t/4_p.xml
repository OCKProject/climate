<p class="p">Climate change would result in a shift of the suitable habitat of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> to higher elevations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The mean elevation of the suitable habitat in the 2050s was projected to be 2,183.66 ± 325.35 m, which is significantly higher (
