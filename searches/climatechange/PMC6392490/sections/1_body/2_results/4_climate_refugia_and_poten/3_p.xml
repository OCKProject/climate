<p class="p">The model of circuit theory highlighted “pinch points” of high level movement. In the current situation, several areas exhibited potentially high current flow; therefore, they likely indicate critical pathways for possible movement across suitable habitats (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a). As habitats shrink and narrow under the conditions modeled for the 2050s, movement will be facilitated by narrowed habitats and severely restricted (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). From the least‐cost path and least‐cost corridors, we modeled linkages between current and future habitats (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). These linkages emphasized routeways in which
