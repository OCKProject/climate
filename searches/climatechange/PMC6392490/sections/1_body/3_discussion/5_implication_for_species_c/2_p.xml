<p class="p">Because climate change is anticipated to alter both the movements and distributions of species, there is a need to take climate change into account during the promotion of adaptive conservation strategies (Schmitz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Investigating connectivity without considering shifts in future habitats would omit areas that are crucial for species movement from current to future habitats. Understanding the connection from current habitats to future habitats can allow for prediction of significant areas necessary for the climate‐induced movement and where interventions for conservation efforts could be focused. For example, Littlefield et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) identified key areas likely to facilitate climate‐induced species movement across western North America. For habitat reduction at the small study scale, like that investigated in this study, the changes in suitable habitat locations also influence the pathways that animals need to track climate change and reach emerging suitable habitats. This also highlights the importance of protecting the current habitat for such situations. The prediction of the potential movement between future habitats will allow for advanced preparation against the negative impacts of climate change.
