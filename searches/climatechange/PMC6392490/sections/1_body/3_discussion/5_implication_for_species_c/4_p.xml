<p class="p">Identifying resistance surface is challenging in connectivity analysis (Milanesi et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Ideally, resistance values would be parameterized with empirical data, but because of a shortage of such information, expert knowledge is often used (Stevenson‐Holt, Watts, Bellamy, Nevin, &amp; Ramsey, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, the use of expert opinion is seen as subjective, human‐centric and unreliable (Puyravaud, Cushman, Davidar, &amp; Madappa, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).Thus, the resistance surface converted from the habitat suitability index is superior to the subjective method of expert opinion to some extent. It takes into account a variety of variables affecting the distribution of species, and facilitates the rapid assessment of the connectivity of specific species.
