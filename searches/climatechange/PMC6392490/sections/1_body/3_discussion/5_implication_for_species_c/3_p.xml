<p class="p">Connectivity analysis that considers climate change typically focuses on two scales—regional and individual species. The regional scale takes several species into account simultaneously; therefore, the ecological niche needs of each species, such as specific climatic condition, elevations, slopes, and special vegetation types, cannot be considered in detail. Instead, it uses a coarsely approximate climatic condition to determine current habitat distribution and to predict future conditions. For example, Littlefield et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) used the multivariate similarity of climates through a principal component analysis to identify climate analogue habitats. The analysis based on the individual species scale, as a refinement of the analysis based on the regional scale, usually requires a species distribution model to simulate future habitats, which can focus on specific requirements. For example, Kang, Minor, Lee, and Park (
