<p class="p">There have been few published articles about the effects of the changing climate on the 
 <italic class="italic">Rhinopithecus</italic> genus to date. A case study about 
 <italic class="italic">Rhinopithecus bieti, </italic>which used climate and socio‐economic scenarios to model land cover changes until 2050, predicted that the area of suitable habitats will be reduced by 15% by 2050 (Li, Wu, Xue, He, &amp; Giraudoux, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The potential distribution area of 
 <italic class="italic">Rhinopithecus avunculus</italic> will be 20% smaller in 2020 than it is under current climate conditions (Van, Manh, &amp; Hoang, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). According to our results, 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> in Hubei will be the most seriously impacted species of the 
 <italic class="italic">Rhinopithecus</italic> genus, with a habitat decrease of 67.2% and a meager 3.5% addition of newly formed habitat by the 2050s. This suggests that the effects of climate change will greatly exacerbate the vulnerability of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic>. These results are consistent with the research of Luo et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), which predicted a habitat reduction of almost 70% by 2050 in the SNJ area and an increase in the mean elevation of suitable habitat. Compared with Luo's analysis, which omitted the Badong Nature Reserve, we considered the entire distribution area of the Hubei population. Among the three subpopulations, the DLT and JHL subpopulations may be forced to recolonize southward due to substantial habitat loss, likely resulting in intraspecific resource competition that will cause population decline of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic>.
