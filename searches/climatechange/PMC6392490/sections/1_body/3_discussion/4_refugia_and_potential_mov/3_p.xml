 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana </italic>will be forced to shift their range away from the current habitat areas that will no longer be suitable and arrive at future habitats. The dispersal path of the least‐cost model can improve movement into the 2050s’ optimal habitat (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Moreover, the map connecting the suitable habitats under the current and future scenarios using circuit theory highlights different corridor types that are important for potential movements and emphasizes that corridors are likely to vary in importance with time (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The potential corridor areas numbered one, two, and three were the more vital areas for current movements and tracking climate change. Corridors four, five, six, and seven will become important under future conditions. Thus, a staged process of conservation actions could be implemented as follows: Conservation actions could be immediately focused on corridor areas 1–3 through assessment of habitat quality and restoration of degraded habitats; the future corridor areas 4–7 should also be protected to ensure they remain ecologically intact for their future use. Rehabilitation of unsuitable habitats could be taken into consideration around these areas. Priority conservation efforts should be focused on these strategic areas. Likewise, long‐term efforts are also needed to monitor not only habitat quality, including its phenology, food availability, and plant community dynamics, but also the status and movement trends of each subpopulation.
