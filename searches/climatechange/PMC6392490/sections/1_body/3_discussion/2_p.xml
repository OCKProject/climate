<p class="p">In this paper, we assessed the impact of climate change on the 
 <italic class="italic">R.Â roxellana</italic> habitat range and identified refugia and corridors under climate change conditions. Our assessment of the species predicted a trajectory of habitat loss following anticipated future climate change. Additionally, we identified strategic areas that should be prioritized during species preservation efforts. Our analysis provides a perspective to evaluate the impact of climate change on habitat connectivity for a species of conservation concern, and proposes targeted actions that consider species characteristics.
