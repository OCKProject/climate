<p class="p">Our model identified climate‐induced shifts in the habitat distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> and determined the most effective regions enabling 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana </italic>to shift its distribution range. However, we made several simplifying assumptions. First, our approach used a relatively coarse resolution of climate data and did not take fine‐scale characteristics into account, which might be central to long‐term survival (Struebig et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and provide climate microrefugia for 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic>. We also used a static map of vegetation and human disturbances, because changes in the vegetation community lag in response to climate change (Barbet‐Massin, Thuiller, &amp; Jiguet, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and the main distribution area was in protected areas where construction projects need strict approval. However, we do not know precisely what kind of changes in land use under climate change might occur with an increasing human population and global economy shifts. Here, we assume that the area will be relatively protected. In addition, our analysis was a species‐specific approach that cannot be directly extended to other species, although the preservation of
 <italic class="italic"> R. roxellana</italic> could benefit other sympatric animal species. Nonetheless, we note that 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana </italic>in Hubei Province is a stand‐alone management unit (Chang, Luo, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), and that use a relatively small spatial extent was valuable for comparing the effects of climate change.
