<p class="p">Increasing connectivity is critical for species’ ability to track rapidly changing climates and for reconfiguring habitats to facilitate access to more suitable habitats (McGuire, Lawler, McRae, Nuñez, &amp; Theobald, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Previous studies of connectivity analysis are used to identify areas that promote species movements between their current habitats (Brodie et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Larue &amp; Nielsen, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Wang et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). However, this analysis does not consider that suitable areas will shift with climate change; thus, it does not determine key areas of importance under changing climate conditions. Although some papers have addressed the shifting of habitats by modeling connectivity for climate change, for example, Nuñez et al., (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), Littlefield et al. (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and Brost and Beier (
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), the majority of these studies have not considered specific species, but instead addressed “coarse‐filter” conservation that ignores species‐specific traits. Therefore, assessments of the impacts of climate change on connectivity and distribution of specific species are needed, particularly those with high conservation values (Schmitz et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
