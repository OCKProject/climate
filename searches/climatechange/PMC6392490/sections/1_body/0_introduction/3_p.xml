<p class="p">The identification of refugia relies on recognition of the current and future distributions of species (Keppel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Habitat suitability assessments based on species distribution modeling (SDM) have been widely used to understand the species response to environmental changes (Gouveia et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) and to identify refugia (Keppel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Alternatively, climate change velocity can also be used to identify refugia, as these areas characterized by low climate change velocity (Keppel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Sandel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In addition, potential refugia may be recognized by investigating analogues set to current climatic conditions and disturbance distributions (Keppel et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, determining if a species can adjust to shifting climatic conditions by altering its current distribution to locations of climatic refugia or optimal habitat is challenging (Lambers, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) because the accessibility of analogue climate habitats is constrained by landscape permeability from anthropogenic modifications and species dispersal capabilities (Littlefield, McRae, Michalak, Lawler, &amp; Carroll, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Thus, maintaining habitat connectivity, the degree to which organisms can move through a landscape (Taylor, Fahrig, Henein, &amp; Merriam, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>), is the most commonly recommended strategy for conserving species diversity in a changing climate (Heller &amp; Zavaleta, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Nu√±ez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>).
