<p class="p">Here, we built a 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> distribution model based on monkey occurrences associated with bioclimatic and environmental variables. We aimed to (a) assess the extent that climate change will impact the 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> habitat distribution from the current period to the 2050s, (b) identify refugia locations that could maintain the population under climate change and dispersal paths that could facilitate the movement of the population to suitable future habitats, and (c) provide suggestions for the conservation of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana</italic> in Hubei Province under environmental change.
