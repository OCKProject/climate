<p class="p">We employed the maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt 3.3.3k), one of the best performing approaches in modeling species distribution, with presence‐only data (Elith &amp; Yates,

 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), with the exception of dividing the percentage at 75% of the occurrence data into training set for model construction and the percentage at 25% into a random test set for evaluation of model performance. We conducted a subsampling procedure with 15 replicates (Khatchikian, Sangermano, Kendell, &amp; Livdahl,
