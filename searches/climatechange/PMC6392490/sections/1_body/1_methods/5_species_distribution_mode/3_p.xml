<p class="p">To evaluate the model performance, we used the threshold‐independent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) with value ranges from 0 to 1. AUC values close to 1 indicate perfect model agreement (Phillips et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The logistic results of the MaxEnt model were considered to represent the probabilities of species occurrence (Phillips &amp; Dudík, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We then reclassified the results into presence and absence using the average of the maximum training sensitivity plus specificity (Liu, Berry, Dawson, &amp; Pearson,
