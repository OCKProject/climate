<p class="p">We used Circuitscape v4.0 (McRae, Shah, &amp; Mohapatra, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) to quantify potential species movement between suitable habitat patches in the current period and the 2050s. The Circuitscape model connectivity was based on the circuit theory, predicting the movement patterns of random walkers between source and target cells across a landscape. High densities of current flow indicate important movement between habitat patches (McRae, Dickson, Keitt, &amp; Shah, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We ran Circuitscape using the pairwise mode for the current period and the 2050s. The suitable habitat patches in each period were treated as nodes (the source and target). We used the inverse of the logistic output from our MaxEnt model as a measure of movement resistance for

 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). For cells with a value larger than the threshold (maximum training sensitivity plus specificity was given by the MaxEnt model), resistance was set to 1. For cells with a value smaller than the threshold, resistance was set to (threshold ‐ “value”) × 100/threshold. We mapped the current flow between suitable habitats for two states (current and the future climate scenario) to visualize habitat connectivity.
