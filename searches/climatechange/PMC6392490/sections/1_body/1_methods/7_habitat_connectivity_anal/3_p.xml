<p class="p">We linked suitable habitats in the 2050s scenario to model potential dispersal paths from current to future habitats. We mapped the least‐cost path and least‐cost corridors between suitable habitats whose distance to the nearest patch was &lt;2.1 km. The resistance layer identical to the input used in Circuitscape. The least‐cost path and corridors were implemented in LinkageMapper (McRae &amp; Kavanagh,
