<p class="p">This study was conducted at the main distribution area of

 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The study area was expanded appropriately to cover larger areas in the surrounding region, including the entire Shennongjia (SNJ) Forestry District, the Badong Nature Reserve, and other areas within the rectangular range in an effort to prevent omissions of 
 <italic class="italic">R. roxellana </italic>likely habitat. The SNJ National Park is located in the SNJ Forestry District; however, this paper uses the term “SNJ Forestry District” to refer to the area not in the SNJ National Park. This paper mainly involves three areas, that is, The SNJ Forestry District, SNJ National Park, and Badong Nature Reserve (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34815-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). There are three monkey subpopulations, Dalongtan (DLT), Jinhoulin (JHL), and Qianjiaping (QJP), that inhabit the SNJ National Park (Yang, Liao, Yu, &amp; Yao, 
 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). A substantial area of the SNJ National Park suffered deforestation between the 1950s and the early 1980s (Zhu,

 <xref rid="ece34815-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>), resulting in human disturbances near scenic locations and habitat fragmentation caused by the increased traffic. Human disturbances in the SNJ Forestry District are mainly concentrated in the spring, when villagers collect Chinese medicinal herbs.
