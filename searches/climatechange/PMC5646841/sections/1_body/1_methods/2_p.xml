<p class="p">A significance level of 5% was used for all statistical tests. All analyses were performed using the statistical software SPSS (Version 24 IBM). Normality testing by visual method and Shapiro-Wilk Test to test found that most of the data were not normally distributed. Therefore Kruskal-Wallis-Test was used to test if two independent groups differed with respect to a metric variable. For correlation analysis Spearman’s rho coefficient was calculated. Fisher’s Exact Test was applied for contingency tables. No adjustment of p-values for multiple testing was performed, as this was considered a pilot-study.</p>
