<p class="p">From November 2015 to August 2016, we surveyed 172 adult patients who underwent pulmonary rehabilitation in the alpine region, thereof 58 in Davos, Switzerland, and 114 in Bad Reichenhall, Germany. On two other occasions in May and August 2015, further 832 healthy tourists aged ≥ 18years were surveyed in the alpine region, thereof 614 in the city of Meran, Italy, and 218 in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany. Recruitment of patients took place “on the streets” near touristic attractions like cable car station or city centre, recruitment of patients took place within the rehabilitation clinics. The surveys for tourists and patients were equally structured except for an additional part in the patients' survey containing the CAT score. Patients were asked to retrospectively fill out the CAT score how they felt at home immediately before the rehabilitation and now at the end of the rehabilitation. Surveys were in German language and can be assessed as German and English version in the online supplement (
