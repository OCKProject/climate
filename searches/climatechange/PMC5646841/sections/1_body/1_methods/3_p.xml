<p class="p">The tourist survey was also part of a larger study on the consequences of climate change in the alpine region on tourism. In the present study, the data from tourists was only used as control to rate the patientsâ€™ perception. Therefore only tourists who had never been diagnosed with lung disease were included in this analysis. A detailed analysis of the data from all tourists will be the subject of a different report focussing on tourism. For all analyses using the CAT score we included only patients with asthma and COPD as the questionnaire has not been studied in other diseases.</p>
