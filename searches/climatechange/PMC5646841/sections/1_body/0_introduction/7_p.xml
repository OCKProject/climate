<p class="p">Recently, there have been an increasing number of studies investigating the influence of climate change on clinical outcomes of patients and on the well-being of the general population. Parameters studied included lung function, symptoms, hospital admissions and mortality. However, the awareness and individual reactions of patients with respiratory disease to the ongoing climate change in the alpine region has not been studied so far. Yet, such patient-centred outcomes are important in order to develop strategies for information and intervention in this vulnerable population.</p>
