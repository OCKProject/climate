<p class="p">Finally, with global warming the number and size of plants is increasing, as well as the amount of pollen and allergenic proteins produced by each plant resulting in an overall elevated risk of pollen allergies [

 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] and occurrence of new allergens [
 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] in temperate zones, rendering asthma therapy and control more difficult in affected patients. Importantly, pollen is also increasingly found in regions that used to be nearly free of pollen, like higher altitudes in the Alps [
 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. The alpine region has been a classical location for pulmonary rehabilitation mainly because of clean air. A recent meta-analysis found that high-altitude alpine therapy is beneficial in asthmatics [
 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Availability of this therapeutic principle may be at risk when alpine climate changes. In addition to clean air, the landscape is the main attraction of the Alps and climate warming-induced changes hereof are particularly obvious with melting glaciers, less snow and different vegetation. Thus, tourists are a second population that may be affected by the changes, even in absence of chronic disease.
