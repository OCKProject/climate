<p class="p">In a survey conducted in German households in 2012 it was found that only 25% of respondants thought that climate change would affect tourism in Germany within the next decades. When asked about consequences of climate change for their personal living conditions, 48.6% of respondants thought that climate change would have very or rather negative consequences, while 48.9% thought that positive and negative consequences were equally important and 2.5% thought that there were rather or very positive consequences. Perception of health risks was not addressed separately in this survey, but together with financial risks. Here it was found that regarding damages of health or finances by heat waves 4% felt affected at present and 52% of participants think damage will occur in Germany in the future. Thus it can be estimated that the degree of feeling affected at present and in the future is higher in our study sample of patients and tourists in the alpine region than in the general German population [
