<p class="p">As expected, the mean age of patients with asthma was younger than the mean age of patients with COPD (50 versus 59 respectively). However, also patients with asthma were mostly middle-aged adults and not young adults as it might be expected from the age prevalence of asthma. This might be due to a selection bias caused by recruitment of the patients in the rehabilitation clinics and therefore the results might not be representative of younger asthma populations. Further bias might be introduced by the time-point of recruitment. While patients were recruited for a longer time-period including the winter, spring and summer season, tourists were recruited in spring and summer season only, thus the main season for pollen allergy.</p>
