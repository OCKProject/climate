<p class="p">This study needs to be interpreted in view of certain limitations. Firstly, as it is a survey that was filled out anonymously, diagnoses of lung disease and allergies are self-reported only and were not verified objectively. This becomes evident as a relatively high number of patients (n = 19, 11%) reported to have both, asthma and COPD. It is unclear if all of these are really affected by Asthma COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS), especially because this diagnosis and its definition is still a matter of debate and research [

 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Thus, for further analyses we grouped them together with the COPD group. Also, this COPD group was relatively small (n = 35) rendering statistical analysis less reliable. Moreover, we did not investigate the correlation of data from the survey with objective clinical outcomes.
