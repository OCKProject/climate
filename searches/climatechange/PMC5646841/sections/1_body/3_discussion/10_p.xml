<p class="p">In a survey conducted in the US, Canada and Malta in 2008/9, perception of current and future health risks by climate change was investigated: One third of Americans, one half of Canadians, and two-thirds of Maltese said that people were harmed at present while about half of the Americans thought this would be the case in the future and 15% thought this would never happen [

 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>], relatively few people answered open-ended questions connecting climate change and human health risks. In our study, response rates to specific consequences of climate change including health-related ones were very high in tourist (&gt;99%) and high in patients (&gt;93%). Thus, it can be speculated that respondants had some degree of passive knowledge regarding these items. However, it will be important for our future studies to investigate the level of active knowledge about health risks associated with climate change using open-end questions.
