<p class="p">Several international and national surveys have addressed the perception of climate change in general and associated health consequences in the general population, but to our knowledge none has focused on patients with lung disease so far. In a national study of American climate change risk perceptions conducted in 2002–3, it was found that mean holistic concern about climate change was 2.9 while current impact’s mean rating was 2.6 on a scale of 1–4 [

In our present study using a similar scale of 1–4, mean personal concern at present was lower (2.42 in patients and 2.38 in tourists). Yet, it is difficult to compare these values as the questions asked were not exactly the same. We specifically asked about being affected personally while Leisoriwitz reported about more general concern. At that time, one third of Americans believed climate change to be harmful to people in the US at present and about half thought this would be the case in the future [

When asked about being affected by climate change in the future the mean rating of the general US population was 2.76 in that study [
