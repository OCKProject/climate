<p class="p">This study provides first insights into the perception of and reactions to the ongoing climate change among patients with chronic lung disease and non-patients. While there is growing evidence for the impact of climate change on objective patient outcomes, data on subjective patient estimation is missing so far. Since specific regions and populations are particularly affected by negative consequences of the climate change, we studied patients with chronic lung disease as a vulnerable population in the alpine region of Germany, Italy and Switzerland as a vulnerable location.</p>
