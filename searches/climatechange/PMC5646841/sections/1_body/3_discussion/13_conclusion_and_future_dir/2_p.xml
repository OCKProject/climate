<p class="p">The overall rating of being affected by climate change is similar between patients and tourists at present and even higher in the tourists regarding the future. This point needs to be addressed in future studies to reveal the reasons for these ratings and answer the following research questions: What do patients and tourists associate with climate change in general? What is their knowledge about health-related consequences of climate change? Why do they feel affected? What are their main concerns regarding different specified time-points in the future? How do these ratings of patients and tourists compare to the general public?</p>
