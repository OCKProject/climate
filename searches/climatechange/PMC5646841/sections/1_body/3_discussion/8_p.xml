<p class="p">Regarding specific consequences of climate change, patients were more disturbed by factors that can impair health, such as increased allergy risk, increasing number of mosquitos and decreased air quality which is also corresponding well to the current objective data. Surprisingly, increasing number of heat-days was rated only mildly concerning by patients and also not significantly different from the touristsâ€™ rating despite being known as an important risk factor for increased mortality in chronic respiratory disease [

 <xref rid="pone.0186632.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Comparing the adaptive behavior of patients and tourists a similar pattern as in the disturbance rating was found. However, here avoidance of heat-days was more pronounced in the patients than in the tourists. Yet, only 53% of the patients would avoid increasing heat-days whereas increasing number of ticks and mosquitos are avoided by a higher percentage (77% and 84% respectively).
