<p class="p">Next, we looked at specific consequences of the climate change that might be important for patients and tourists in terms of health and attractiveness of the alpine destination. Subjects were asked to rate the degree of disturbance (1- not disturbing, 2- rather disturbing, 3- disturbing, 4- absolutely disturbing) for each factor. It was further inquired whether each disturbing factor (rating ≥2) would lead to avoidance of the alpine region as a destination. Changes of weather and natural scenery—such as increasing number of heat days, loss of snow certainty and changing landscape, are equally disturbing to patients and tourists (

Yet patients feel significantly more disturbed by increased risk of extreme weather events such as thunderstorms, increased allergy risk, increasing number of mosquitos and decreased air quality. The latter factors are also those with the highest absolute rate of disturbance in the patients (
