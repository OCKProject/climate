 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0186632.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). Patients with allergies or allergic rhinitis feel significantly more disturbed by an increased allergy risk than those without this kind of disease. Those with allergies would also avoid such risk locations to a significantly higher percentage (
