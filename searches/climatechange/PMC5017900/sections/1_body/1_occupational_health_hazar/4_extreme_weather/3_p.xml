<p class="p">The increased intensity and duration of the wildland fire season due to drought can also result in more exposure of wildland firefighters to smoke and a reduced firefighter recovery time between fire seasons. Additionally, firefighters and other natural resource workers can be exposed to naturally occurring asbestos and/or erionite, fibrous mineral fibers that are potent carcinogens associated with high rates of malignant mesothelioma, during trail and forest road maintenance, timber stand grading, cutting fire lines, and while fighting fires.
