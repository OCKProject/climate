<p class="p">Programs have emerged to enhance building design to lessen the impact on the environment as well as to avoid adversely affecting the health of the occupants. For example, the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), developed in 2000, is a rating system that addresses environmental and building design concerns. The goal of LEED is to “make sure the performance of each building meets the environmental needs of the community as well as the building itself, maintaining a more eco-friendly design” (

Buildings receive credits for criteria such as location near public transit and energy efficiency. The higher the number of credits, the more sustainable the building is considered. The LEED rating system was established by the U.S. Green Building Council (

NIOSH successfully recommended the inclusion of worker protection standards in the LEED criteria such as improved indoor air quality, fall protection, and safe access for maintenance workers and others. Building on LEED, workers can be protected through all stages of the building life by considering Life Cycle Safety. Life Cycle Safety addresses the safety and health of workers who may be at risk during construction, maintenance, and ultimately demolition of the building (

Other aspects of the built environment include such activities as urban and landscape design. No literature was found indicating climate-related hazards to workers beyond what might be seen in construction, forestry, and landscaping.
