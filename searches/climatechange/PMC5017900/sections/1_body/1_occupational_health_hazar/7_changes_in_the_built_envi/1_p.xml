<p class="p">Climate change has implications for the built environment and the workers involved with it. Climate change resulting in sealed buildings will continue to affect exposure to air pollutants in buildings that include by-products of combustion, radon, and volatile and semi-volatile organic compounds and biological organisms such as mold.

 </xref> Since 2008, the literature has introduced new topics and ideas related to occupational safety and health risks due to changes in the built environment including the green building movement. Studies have shown that effects of climate change can be contained or even reversed with improvements to building standards and energy consumption can be reduced with building improvements.
