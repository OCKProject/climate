<p class="p">As society experiences, responds to, and attempts to prevent the effects of climate change industrial transitions will occur. “Green” industries including renewable energy production and the development and use of low-carbon technologies will see substantial growth.

 </xref> In addition, some traditional industries, such as construction, are seeing a transition toward “green activities”, such as retrofitting buildings for energy conservation.

 </xref> The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that in 2011 there were 3.4 million “Green Goods and Services” jobs (2.6% of total U.S. employment) and greener industries are projected to experience greater job growth than less green industries.

 </xref> Negative impacts of climate change are expected in other traditional industries such as agriculture and fishing, potentially leading to contraction of the workforce or modification of work practices.

 </xref> Changes in the industry distributions of employment opportunities as industries experience climate change related disruption, expansion, or adaptation might lead to exposure to traditional hazards in new occupations and/or industries (e.g. slips, trips and falls, musculoskeletal disorders, chemical exposures), or the emergence of previously unidentified hazards. The transition period might be associated with job insecurity, job loss, economic migration, and additional training needs, as workers and employers adapt to the new economic environment.
