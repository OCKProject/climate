<p class="p">One of the potential responses to climate change is an increase in recycling which may reduce energy needs. In 2013, over 87 million tons of municipal solid waste was recycled or composted in the U.S., which the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates as resulting in an annual reduction of more than 186 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions—comparable to removing the emissions from over 39 million passenger vehicles from the road for a year.

 </xref> Although the environmental benefits of recycling (also known as materials recovery) are clear, recycling workers are exposed to a wide variety of occupational hazards. In the U.S. during 2011–2013 there were 17 occupational fatalities among workers in materials recovery facilities. The rate of non-fatal injury in materials recovery facility workers in 2012 was 8.5 per 100 workers, compared with 5.1 per 100 for all waste management and remediation services workers, and 3.5 per 100 for all industries.
