<p class="p">Tracking the occupational injuries and illnesses associated with climate change related industrial transition, emerging industries, and the growth of “green jobs” is needed so more detailed research can be planned. To appropriately safeguard workers, research is needed to: better understand where it is reasonable to apply existing knowledge and safety standards in emerging industries; identify previously unrecognized hazards associated with new technologies and emerging industries; develop safer materials for “green” product construction; and assess the need for new hazardous substance exposure limits. Rapid growth and extensive construction in emerging industries also provides an opportunity to encourage the incorporation of Prevention through Design (PtD) principles to design out worker hazards in facility construction and technology development.
