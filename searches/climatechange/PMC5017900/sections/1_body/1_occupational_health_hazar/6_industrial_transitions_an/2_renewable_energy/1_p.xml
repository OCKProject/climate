 </xref> While it has been suggested that renewable energy production may result in fewer occupational injuries and fatalities than fossil fuel extraction and processing, each type of renewable energy production process presents unique occupational hazards in the construction, operation, and maintenance of the facilities (

 </xref> Research on worker safety, particularly long-term occupational health effects, in renewable energy industries is limited. Worker safety standards and activities are often based on experience from other industries that are assumed to have similar hazards.

 </xref> It has also been noted that as some alternative energy production industries, such as biofuel production, grow without clear and specific health and safety standards in place, workers may be exposed to unnecessary hazards.
