<p class="p">The global mean earth surface air temperature has increased during the past 100Â years and the resultant deleterious heat-related effects including deaths in workers have been well established.

 </xref> Many workers spend their entire work shift in a variety of indoor and outdoor hot environments that may become hotter because of ambient rising temperatures, increases in extreme heat events, or shifting and expanding hot seasons. For many workers, occupational exposures to heat and humidity may be more hazardous than community exposures because workers generally have less control of exposures in their work activities.
