 </xref> This new guidance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reaffirms the 1986 recommended exposure limit/recommended alert limits and reflects increased awareness about physiological changes that result from heat stress, specifically involving better understanding of the central nervous system, circulatory regulation, the sweating mechanism, water and electrolyte balance, and dietary factors. Recent literature supported updates and updated guidance on hydration, the definition of exertional heat stroke, risk factors associated with heat-related illness, and the effects of heat on toxicological responses.
