 </xref> Increases in respiration can lead to additional toxicant exposure through inhalation, and increases in sweat and skin blood flow can lead to more efficient transcutaneous absorption of toxicants.

 </xref> High temperatures may also accelerate dispersion of pesticides and increase the density of airborne particles. Some workers may be more likely to not use PPE, or not use it correctly because of discomfort from the heat.

 </xref> In addition to pesticides, other airborne pollutants may put additional strain or have exacerbated health effects in exposed workers in hot environments.
