<p class="p">Considerable research regarding the impact of climate change on vector-borne disease and other biological hazards (venomous insects and reptiles, water-borne disease, non-vector-borne pathogens, and poisonous plants) has been conducted since 2008.

 </xref> However, literature specifically addressing the occupational implications of those hazards to specific workers is much more limited because of the number of workers and diversity of occupations that may be affected by biological hazards. Outdoor workers are primarily at risk, including those in construction, landscaping, forestry, brush clearing, land surveying, farming, oil field and utility work, natural resources management, and wildland firefighters.

 </xref> This increased risk stems from heightened exposure to vectors such as mosquitoes, ticks, and fleas that can transmit parasites, viruses, or bacteria.
