 </xref> Although some uncertainties remain, the evidence that climate change has contributed to the expanded range of certain vectors is considerable.

 </xref> For example, in 2014, the first locally acquired case of Chikungunya, a vector-borne viral disease, was documented in the U.S.

  <sup class="sup">[33,107–111,195]</sup>
 </xref> While the introduction of Chikungunya is not thought to be due to climate change, the possibility of establishment and subsequent spread could be influenced by this process. Outdoor workers have up to a five times higher risk for Lyme disease than indoor workers.

 </xref> The numbers of high-risk counties for Lyme disease in the United States has increased over the last 20 years by &gt;320% in the north-eastern states and &gt;250% in the north-central states.

 </xref> Climate change is thought to be one factor that could be contributing to this spread.

 </xref> West Nile and Zika viruses, other known vector-borne hazards to outdoor workers, may increase because of climate change. Recommendations to protect workers exposed to vector-borne diseases have been published.
