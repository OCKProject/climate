 </xref> Climate change resulting in rising temperatures and an increased wildland fire season, unless mitigated, is projected to have the following effects on national air quality levels: produce 2–8 part per billion increases in summertime average ground-level ozone concentrations in many regions in the U.S.; further exacerbate ozone concentrations on days when weather is already conducive to high ozone concentrations; lengthen the “ozone season”, and produce increases and decreases in particle pollution over different regions in the U.S.
