<p class="p">Airline pilots' UV exposure will increase to the extent to which human activity and climate change affects stratospheric ozone layers. A few studies have demonstrated that airline pilots are at risk of adverse health effects in their eyes from exposure to UV radiation. Hammer et al.

 </xref> concluded that pilots flying in daylight hours are exposed to solar radiation that is 2 or 3 times greater at cruising altitudes compared to exposures at sea level. Although pilots are protected by the aircraft windshield which blocks most UVB radiation, there is no standard for the optical transmission properties of the aircraft windshields. Development of such a standard is important to protect pilots from UV radiation. It is known that UV radiation increases by 10–12% every 1,000 meters of altitude and thereby subsequently affects pilots.
