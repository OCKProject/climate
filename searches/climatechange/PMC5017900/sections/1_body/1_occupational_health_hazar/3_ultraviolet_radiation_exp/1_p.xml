<p class="p">The complex interaction of greenhouse gases, climate change, and stratospheric ozone depletion, results in increased ultraviolet (UV) radiation that can affect all people, particularly outdoor workers.

 </xref> However, while at present UV levels are still increased relative to the 1960s, terrestrial UV radiation is projected to decrease in the 21st century.
 <xref rid="cit0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">[47]</sup>
 </xref> This change is in part due to the decrease in ozone-depleting chemicals in the atmosphere. Even though the Montreal protocol of 1987 led to reduction of these gases, they still have long lifetimes and “normal” ozone levels are not likely to occur for several decades.

  <sup class="sup">[48]</sup>
 </xref> Moreover, the recovery may be longer in northern latitudes and in the Arctic.
 <xref rid="cit0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">[48,49]</sup>
 </xref> Because increased numbers of workers are projected to be working in the Arctic, more will be at risk of UV-related health effects (

Additionally, by the year 2100, “models predict that UV radiation will have increased in the tropics (where current UV radiation is already intense) and to have decreased at polar latitudes …”

 </xref> There is a strong interaction between stratospheric ozone-depletion and change in climate induced by greenhouse gas-induced climate change.

 </xref> Overexposure to UV radiation can increase the risk of eye damage (e.g., cataracts and photokeratitis), skin and other cancers, sunburn, and immune suppression.
 <xref rid="cit0051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">[51]</sup>
 </xref> It is therefore likely that outdoor workers will have higher exposure to UV radiation as a result of climate change and will be at higher risk for adverse health effects for decades.

 </xref> To the extent that climate change and planetary warming increase temperatures, more fair-skinned people may be exposed to UV radiation and be at risk of skin cancers.
