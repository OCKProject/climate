<p class="p">Beyond increased awareness, there is need for more strategic thinking about actions that prevent or reduce risk to workers resulting from climate change. While there are still uncertainties about climate change models, climate change is likely to result in increasing prevalence, distribution, and severity of known occupational hazards, and new unanticipated hazards may emerge.

 </xref> Employment increases are likely in jobs intended to mitigate or respond to consequences of climate change. Workers may consequently be exposed to extreme conditions that the general public can elect to avoid. Impacts to workers will include the direct effects of climate change-potentiated occupational hazards such as increased ambient temperatures. Indirect climate-change-associated occupational hazards are also likely to occur from industrial transitions, emerging industries, and changes in the built environment. How to address these anticipated impacts is an important question. Identification of gaps related to specific hazards, their severity, and location of populations at risk and identification of information and communication tools that will protect workers are also needed. This article provides priorities for action to address these issues.
