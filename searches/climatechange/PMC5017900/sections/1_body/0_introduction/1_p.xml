<p class="p">Workers have received inadequate attention in the literature on climate change and public health.

  <sup class="sup">[1]</sup>
 </xref> To address this deficit, in 2009, a preliminary framework for how climate change could affect worker safety and health was developed.
 <xref rid="cit0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
  <sup class="sup">[2]</sup>
 </xref> That framework was based on an assessment of the scientific literature published from 1988â€“2008. Seven categories of climate-related hazards were identified: (1) increased ambient temperature; (2) air pollution; (3) ultraviolet radiation exposure; (4) extreme weather; (5) vector-borne diseases and expanded habitats; (6) industrial transitions and emerging industries; and (7) changes in the built environment. In addition to identifying these seven categories, the framework charted areas where the occupational safety and health field could address occupational hazards of climate change. These areas included alteration of standards, modification and improvement of hazard controls including personal protective equipment (PPE), development of acclimatization procedures, new research directions, development of new hazard control guidance and hazard communications, development of early warning systems and surveillance, and increased emphasis on prevention through design.
