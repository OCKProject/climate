<p class="p">This article updates and strengthens the 2009 framework with a review and assessment of the peer-reviewed literature from 2008–2014 for each of the seven-climate related occupational safety and health hazard categories. Recent examples of hazards in each of the climate-related categories are provided. Some recent reports from authoritative organizations on environmental and public health issues of climate change now include workers as vulnerable populations.
