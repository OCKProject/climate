    <bold class="bold">Identify new models</bold>. The utility of current approaches to risk assessment are likely useful for climate change models but this should be assessed. Meanwhile new forecasting and risk assessment models that integrate occupational safety and health and climate data are needed to evaluate the vulnerability of health care, public health, and emergency responder systems, and to conduct workforce health impact assessments. Programs such as the Chicago Extreme Weather Operations Plan can serve as a model for activating and coordinating a response to climate-related hazards.

    <bold class="bold">Consider uncertainties</bold>. Risk assessment involves decision-making when there are uncertainties and limited data. One source of uncertainty pertains to factors that result in variability of response to climate-related hazards. Some of these susceptibility factors include: age, immunologic status, physical condition, use of prescription drugs, degree of acclimatization, and genetics. Sensitivity analyses should be conducted utilizing these and other variables. Ultimately, risk assessment will involve the extent to which workers are exposed to climate-related hazards given these various sources of variability.
