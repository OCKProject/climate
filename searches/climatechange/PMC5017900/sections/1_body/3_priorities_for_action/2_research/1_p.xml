<p class="p">Research is needed to increase the knowledge of climate change effects on workers and improve the options for an effective occupational safety and health response. 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows specific research needs in each of these categories for the specific climate-related hazards. The following steps may assist with identifying occupational safety and health research priorities.

    <bold class="bold">Identify the most vulnerable workers</bold>. Changes in the environment could result in increased prevalence of heat stress, respiratory, and cardiovascular disease among certain worker populations. Outdoor workers are often the first to be exposed to the effects of climate change and are affected by temperature extremes and disease vectors for long durations and at high intensity. Extreme weather events can also put emergency, rescue, and clean-up workers in situations involving exposure to hazardous agents as well as physical and psychological risks.

    <bold class="bold">Determine interactions between climate, work hazards and other factors</bold>. Assessing the interactions of climate, occupational hazards, and worker vulnerability is an important new area of research. To adequately understand the combined impact of environmental factors on workers' health requires the collaboration and expertise of researchers in atmospheric science, environmental health, epidemiology, psychology, medicine, and other fields.

    <bold class="bold">Investigate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies and hazard controls</bold>. Controls developed and implemented to reduce the likelihood or impact of adverse worker health outcomes potentially associated with climate change should be systematically investigated and evaluated to determine if they are effective and practical mechanisms for reducing climate change related worker safety and health hazards. The need to design and evaluate PPE for use in high heat and humidity and in extreme weather events is critical.
