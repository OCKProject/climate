<p class="p">Surveillance is important in identifying and prioritizing occupational safety and health hazards related to climate change, establishing research priorities, targeting interventions, and evaluating implemented interventions and other prevention strategies to reduce work related morbidity and mortality associated with climate change events.

    <bold class="bold">Determine risk by hazard, occupation, and location</bold>. The impact on occupational safety and health of climate change events such as extreme weather differs from one geographic location to another and involves factors such as local ecology, geography, water supply, worker population, and primary work activities.

    </xref> If appropriately designed and implemented, surveillance activities can assist with identifying climate change related hazards by occupation and location, and can guide prevention and intervention efforts to reduce occupational morbidity and mortality.

    <bold class="bold">Enhance sentinel event/early warning systems</bold>. Early warning systems use environmental and public health data to identify and forecast regional health risks. For example, environmental variables have been used to predict outbreaks of malaria in Botswana.

    </xref> Early warning and sentinel surveillance systems can assist with identifying, predicting, and assessing trends regarding work-related injury and illness, exposures, and other hazards. Few if any current surveillance systems can directly detect climate-related occupational illness or monitor a report, or respond to users.

    <bold class="bold">Modify existing surveillance systems</bold>. Analysis of the National Center for Health Statistics' Compressed Mortality File showed that between 1979 and 2004, extreme cold or heat accounted for 75% of climate-related deaths. These deaths may be more preventable than those caused by earth movements, floods, and storms.

    </xref> Existing surveillance systems could possibly be modified to incorporate leading and lagging indicators, non-temperature related climate hazards (e.g., disease vectors, air pollution), reliable tracking, and health data collection systems to assist with monitoring for increased morbidity and mortality among workers associated with climate change.
