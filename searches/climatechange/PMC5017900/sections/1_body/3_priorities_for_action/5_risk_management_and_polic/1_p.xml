<p class="p">Research, surveillance and risk assessment activities can inform climate change risk management programs and policy development. The following steps can help ensure that risk management programs and policies incorporate occupational safety and health.

    <bold class="bold">Develop adaptive response/control guidance</bold>. Since climate change presents new occupational hazards and exposures, public health and occupational safety and health professionals must adapt and respond to the issues as they emerge.
    <xref rid="cit0067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
     <sup class="sup">[67]</sup>
    </xref> For example, the knowledge about the specific occupational safety and health hazards encountered in green jobs has significant gaps. If hazards unique to green jobs are identified, effective prevention campaigns, such as Prevention through Design, can be implemented as technology is developed.

    <bold class="bold">Develop employer and worker guidance</bold>. In the U.S., employers are responsible, to the extent possible, for providing workplaces free of recognized hazards and mitigating risk to workers from hazards that cannot be eliminated. However, as Roelofs and Wegman
    <xref rid="cit0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
     <sup class="sup">[1]</sup>
    </xref> noted, “Employers may not be sufficiently prepared, empowered, educated, concerned, or compelled to protect their employees from the health impacts of climate change.” Most hazards of climate change are known and the means to protect the workforce are known as well.

     <sup class="sup">[2,13,19,28,58,68,116]</sup>
    </xref> Worker guidance and educational materials are also needed to allow workers to protect themselves and advocate for employer action.

   <p class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Incorporate consideration of worker risks into planning</bold>. For the most part, hazard prevention programs for the workforce have not been a specific part of any state's climate-change action plan. Occupational safety and health should be considered a core component of any public health climate change plan. Occupational safety and health professionals should be part of the planning process and play an important role in preparing for conditions that may affect public health and in communicating the need for climate change policies that address occupational safety and health to policymakers and the public.

   <p class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Integrate occupational safety and health with public health efforts</bold>. Climate change is an issue where the health concerns of workers and the public at large clearly intersect. The health and productivity of the workforce reflects the health of the general population. Climate change is an issue for workers, not only because they can be affected in their current workplace, but also because the people who are expected to be responsible for first response and recovery are workers and volunteers. Climate change models must be scaled to identify vulnerable areas and populations, locally and regionally, and identify and address vulnerable worker subpopulations.

   <p class="p">
    <bold class="bold">Improve risk communication</bold>. Enhancing integration of climate action networks with health communication and surveillance tools is a requirement for effective risk communication. For example, in an effort to reduce heat-related events, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration partnered with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on weather service alerts that incorporate worker safety precautions and worker safety information (

    <bold class="bold">Enhance preparedness efforts</bold>. Anticipating hazards and future risks to workers is the basis for preparation to prevent or minimize them. Preparedness also requires assessment of capacity for developing and implementing prevention, mitigation, adaptation, and resilience programs for workers.
    <xref rid="cit0190" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">
     <sup class="sup">[190–192]</sup>
    </xref> These efforts may require working with state and local health and labor departments. Preparedness related to workers should have outdoor workers as a primary focus. To enhance preparedness, increased awareness among authorities, decision-makers, occupational safety and health practitioners, employers, and workers about climate-related hazards to workers is needed. An Executive Order 13514 on sustainability performance goals issued in 2009 (and since revoked) is one example of an attempt to raise this awareness at the Federal level.
