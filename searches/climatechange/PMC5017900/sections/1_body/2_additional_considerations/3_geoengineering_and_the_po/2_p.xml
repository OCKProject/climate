<p class="p">Some potential positive benefits of geoengineering such as cooling of the planet that would reduce the adverse human health impacts of excessive heat, flooding, droughts, influenza, malaria, etc. that result in high rates of global morbidity and mortality may be possible. However, the predictive models have indicated that a number of adverse effects associated with carbon capture storage and/or solar radiation management geoengineering could occur.

 </xref> The extent to which geoengineering would create hazards and risks for workers is unknown. One way to begin to address potential worker hazards is to develop scenarios for geoengineering and identify job tasks that would be included in those scenarios and the hazards that might arise. Hazard and operability studies, fault-tree analyses, and other risk assessment methods can be used for this purpose.
