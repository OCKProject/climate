<p class="p">Literature on economic costs or losses related to the exposure of workers to climate changing conditions is limited but provides some useful observations. Individual, local, national, and regional economic productivity may be affected by workers slowing down and reducing their physical exertion in an attempt to prevent heat-related illness.

The study also specified that the similarity among such factors as the influence of temperature and tropical cyclones is mostly neglected in economic models predicting impacts of climate change.
