<p class="p">Although researchers have demonstrated the importance of the economic impact of reduced labor productivity because of limited work hours imposed to reduce exposures to excessive heat, few studies provide a comprehensive picture of the different economic issues related to these exposures. Additionally, there is little published research on the efficacy of interventions to reduce risks and hence economic costs of exposures of workers to the climate changing conditions. More research is needed to produce the comprehensive data to estimate the economic burden.</p>
