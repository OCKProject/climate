<p class="p">Another well-established approach to understanding environmentally significant individual behavior is the VBN theory proposed by 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern et al. (1999)</xref> and 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern (2000)</xref>. This theory proposes a causal sequence that moves from stable values and ecological worldviews to an awareness of consequences for the valued object (e.g., the environment). This in turn influences one’s sense of responsibility to act, which in turn influences personal norms (conceived as an individual’s sense of personal obligation to act on behalf of the environment). At first glance the centrality of personal norms in the VBN runs counter to the primacy of social norms in the social identity perspective. However, the social identity approach conceives of the self as made up of social identity 
 <italic class="italic">and</italic> personal identities and so these two approaches are not contradictory. Moreover, the VBN is derived from Schwartz’s Moral-Norm-Activation theory and 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwartz (1973)</xref> argued that individual expectations that underpin personal norms stem from shared social norms (see 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Bratt, 1999</xref> for a demonstration of this relationship in relation to recycling). 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern (2000)</xref> also acknowledges that there are a range of factors that feed into environmental behavior, including features of the personal, social, and economic context, and that the influence of personal norms on behavior will depend on the importance of contextual factors. Where the influence of contextual factors are strong, attitudinal factors as outlined in the VBN will be relatively weak predictors of environmental behaviors.
