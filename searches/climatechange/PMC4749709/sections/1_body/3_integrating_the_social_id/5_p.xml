<p class="p">Within the environmental psychology literature there are two key theories that often frame research seeking to understand environmental decisions and behavior: the theory of planned behavior (TPB; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ajzen, 1991</xref>) and value-belief-norm (VBN) theory (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern et al., 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stern, 2000</xref>). The attraction of the TPB is that it is a parsimonious model—it proposes that attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control predict intentions which in turn predict behavior. Another advantage of the model is that its simplicity allows other relevant variables to be integrated into the model thereby increasing its predictive power (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Conner and Armitage, 1998</xref>). Social identity researchers have integrated social identity concepts into the TPB in two main ways: First, they have drawn on social identity theory to address the question of why subjective norms often emerge as the weakest predictor of intentions (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Armitage and Conner, 2001</xref>). From a social identity perspective, it is not necessarily the norms of important others 
 <italic class="italic">in general</italic> that will predict environmental behavior intentions, but rather the norms of the most behaviorally relevant group (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Terry and Hogg, 1996</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Terry et al., 1999</xref>). 
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Terry et al. (1999)</xref> showed that perceived norms of a behaviorally relevant reference group were related to recycling intentions for group members who were strongly identified. 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fielding et al. (2008b)</xref> have also incorporated perceptions of the intergroup context, specifically urban versus rural relations, into the TPB to predict farmers’ intentions to engage in sustainable natural resource management. They showed that these intergroup perceptions emerged as an additional predictor above and beyond the TPB variables. Hence, the social identity approach complements the TPB and can increase its potential to understand and predict environmentally related behavior. It clarifies which norms are likely to influence behavior and highlights the potential of the intergroup context to influence environmental intentions.
