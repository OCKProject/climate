  <p class="p">Stable states and trajectories in the example system (Eq.Â

   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) The equilibria of state x for constant driver D are shown as black lines (continuous: stable; dashed: unstable). The flow towards a stable state is shown as dashed orange arrows; B
   <sub class="sub">1</sub> and B
   <sub class="sub">2</sub> indicate the bifurcation points. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Time evolution of driver D for two pulses, the red one having a longer period than the blue one. The trajectories of the system that result from these forcings are shown as red and blue curves in (
