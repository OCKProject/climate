  <p class="p">Summer rainfall in mm/day in the monsoon model in dependence on oceanic specific moisture and net atmospheric radiation. The two red orbits show an annual cycle of the two parameters where the annual mean state is indicated with a dot. The resulting annual cycle of precipitation of each orbit is shown in the inset with continuous (dashed) lines for a situation where conditions for a monsoon onset are met (not met) in summer.</p>
