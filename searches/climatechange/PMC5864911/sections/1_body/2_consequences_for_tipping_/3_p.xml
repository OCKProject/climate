<p id="Par15" class="p">Particularly important for the lives of many people are the abrupt shifts in monsoon systems occurring within the seasonal and orbital cycles. Similarly, the current loss of summer sea ice reminds us that sea ice is nonlinear system that is subject to a marked seasonal cycle. Moreover, multiple equilibria are supposed to exist in several marine and terrestrial ecosystems including lakes
