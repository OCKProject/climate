<p id="Par16" class="p">Finally, an iconic example of a tipping point is the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) which can show multiple states in models of different complexity

 </sup>. Probably related to the AMOC are the quasi-regular Dansgaard-Oeschger events which have been argued to be caused by a regular driver

 </sup>. Due to the inertia of the cryosphere and lithosphere, the climate is not in equilibrium with the orbital forcing. Small insolation differences from one orbital cycle to the next can thus cause very different climates
