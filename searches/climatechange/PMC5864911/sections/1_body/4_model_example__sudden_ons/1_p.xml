 </sup> which describes an idealized summer monsoon that can switch between an “on” and “off” state (see Supplementary Information). The mechanism responsible for the abrupt behavior in the model is the moisture-advection feedback. It has recently been challenged that this feedback would be strong enough to support such nonlinearity

 </sup>. While the underlying mechanism is hence uncertain, it is clear that abrupt monsoon switches both in the seasonal cycle and in response to orbital forcing do occur. By applying the tipping point framework we speculate that a common mechanism is behind the jumps within the annual cycle and the abrupt transitions on millennial time scales. While the Levermann model suggests the moisture-advection feedback as the cause, any other positive feedback would essentially yield the same qualitative behaviour.
