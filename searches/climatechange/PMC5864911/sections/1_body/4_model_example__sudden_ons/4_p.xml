<p id="Par25" class="p">The annual cycle of rainfall that results from the trajectory of q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R* is shown in the inset of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>. As soon as the “off” state disappears in early summer at the right border of the shaded bistable region, an abrupt monsoon onset occurs. Later in the summer, R* and q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> decline and rainfall decreases with them, until it drops to zero when the “on” state disappears at the left border of the shaded bistable region. An alternative situation with a different mean of q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R* is shown by the dashed orbit and dashed annual precipitation cycle, where precipitation is zero during the whole year. The transition from the regime where a monsoon circulation establishes each year to the regime where it does not establish constitutes a generalized tipping point. The monsoon collapse occurs when the threshold value of q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R* is not reached anymore in summer.
