<p id="Par22" class="p">We now impose an annual cycle on the parameters q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R*. The model is only valid for summer conditions and cannot describe any precipitation not associated with the summer monsoon. We therefore set P to zero in other seasons, knowing that no monsoon rainfall occurs during that time. In order to obtain an asymmetric annual cycle with an abrupt onset like in observations, we apply two strategies:

    </sup> by introducing a small bistable regime at the critical threshold (the shaded region with a width of 0.5 g/kg at the boundary).

   <p id="Par24" class="p">We introduce a phase lag of one month between the two cyclic drivers, making oceanic moisture q
    <sub class="sub">o</sub> lag the seasonal cycle in R*. This approach may be justified by the different memories of ocean and atmosphere: while the atmosphere can adjust to the solar insolation within days, the oceanic temperature which controls specific humidity lags the insolation cycle by many weeks. The resulting annual cycle of q
    <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R* is shown as a red orbit in the parameter plane of Fig.
