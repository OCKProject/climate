<p id="Par21" class="p">The most important parameters that determine the model’s state are the atmospheric humidity over the ocean q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and the radiative balance of the atmospheric column over land R. Without any alterations to the model we generalize R here to also include the sensible heat flux at the Earth’s surface and call the resulting quantity R*. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> shows the precipitation P associated with the summer monsoon as a result of q
 <sub class="sub">o</sub> and R*. The threshold that separates the “on” and “off” states can be seen as a sharp boundary between the blue area (no monsoon rainfall) and other colors (monsoon rainfall of different magnitude).
