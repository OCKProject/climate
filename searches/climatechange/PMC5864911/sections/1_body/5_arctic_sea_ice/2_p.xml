<p id="Par27" class="p">Hence, it is plausible that tipping points in sea ice have occurred in the Earthâ€™s past, triggered by changes in the continental configuration, Milankovitch forcing, or the seasonal insolation cycle. In this regard, Eisenman

 </sup> provides an insightful parameter analysis of a simple Arctic sea ice model that is driven by the annual cycle of solar and terrestrial radiation. Small variations in these fluxes can lead to abrupt changes in the annual cycle of sea ice. Compared to the previous systems, Arctic sea ice and the surface ocean constitute a slow system that is not in equilibrium with the annual cycle of insolation. This can be seen from the fact that the annual cycle of Arctic sea ice volume lags the insolation cycle by approx. three months. The analysis by Eisenman

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>
 </sup> was performed with a model that already included the annual cycle of short- and long-wave insolation. The concept of tipping points in periodically forced systems suggests that the bifurcations in the model originate from multiple states under certain fixed values of insolation, as the following model results show.
