<p id="Par26" class="p">It has been hypothesized whether global warming can cause abrupt and irreversible sea-ice loss in the Arctic

 </sup>. The most important argument for this idea is the positive feedback between surface albedo and sea-ice loss (ice-albedo feedback). It has been found that the existence of bifurcations in sea ice models depends on the description of spatial differences and the seasonal cycle
