<p id="Par29" class="p">The solutions in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> are periodic in time because of the prescribed annual cycle in the long-wave budget L, and downwelling short-wave radiation, S. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b–d</xref> again displays the annual cycle for three distinct values of L
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> (red lines). In addition, we show to what state the sea-ice system would evolve if there was no annual cycle (green and blue lines). To this end, we fix S and L to the values corresponding to a particular day in a year and integrate the model forward in time, starting from large positive and negative E. For most days in the year, only one asymptotic solution exists. For example, under permanent summer conditions, all ice melts away and the ocean becomes so warm that the outgoing long-wave radiation balances the absorbed radiation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>, green line). Under permanent winter conditions, the ice grows to an infinite thickness, because there is no negative feedback in the model to limit the ice growth. In such cases of failed convergence we artificially set the enthalpy to −7 GJ/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (corresponding to a thickness of approx. 23 m). As the ice-ocean system cannot fully adjust to the fast insolation changes in the course of a year, the amplitude of its annual cycle is very small compared to the difference of its steady state solutions. The solutions overlap only during a short period in spring and an even shorter period in autumn, in the rest of the year only one solution exists. Nonetheless, the existence of multiple solutions still carries over to the periodically forced system for a certain parameter regime.
