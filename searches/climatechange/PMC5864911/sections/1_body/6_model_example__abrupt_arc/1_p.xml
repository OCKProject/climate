 </sup> calculates an energy balance for a well-mixed box of ocean water, covered with ice of a single thickness (see Supplementary Information). When ice is present, the enthalpy E is negative and proportional to the ice thickness. In the absence of ice, E is positive and proportional to the ocean temperature. The bifurcation parameter L
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> represents the annual mean outgoing long-wave radiation budget at the surface (not including temperature feedbacks) and becomes smaller when the climate warms. For values of L
