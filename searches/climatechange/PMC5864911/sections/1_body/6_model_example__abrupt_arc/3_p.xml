<p id="Par30" class="p">The bifurcations in this default model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>) can thus be understood from the change of the asymptotic solutions with L
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>. In a cold climate, the summer is too short and insolation is too low to melt enough ice within one summer; a perennial ice cover is therefore the only solution of the periodically forced system. Under global warming (decreasing L
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>), the asymptotic solution moves to larger E and the melting season becomes longer (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5c</xref>); this is where the periodically forced system has multiple solutions, balancing between the cold and warm attractors. Finally, the winter becomes too short for the formation of sea ice thick enough to survive the following summer, and the ice-free solution is the only one that remains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5d</xref>).
