<p id="Par39" class="p">On top of that, studies on isolated tipping elements may even not be sufficient, as different Earth system components are linked in their stability behaviour and thus do not act in isolation. For example, sea-ice loss and the meridional ocean circulation affect each other

 </sup>. In light of the large uncertainties, the candidates and suspected mechanisms of tipping points will certainly evolve with new knowledge. As the Earth system is interspersed with feedbacks and natural thresholds, and features oscillations and environmental fluctuations on a vast range of time scales, it seems plausible that non-equilibrium tipping points have already occurred in the past and could occur again in the future.
