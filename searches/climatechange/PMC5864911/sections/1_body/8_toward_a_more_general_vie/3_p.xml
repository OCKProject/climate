<p id="Par38" class="p">One particular challenge in this regard is to investigate the applicability of statistical stability indicators that could provide an early warning of abrupt change. In climate research, this concept has mostly been explored in the static context of classical tipping points

 </sup>. In the case of the systems above, classical indicators like rising variance and autocorrelation are not necessarily the most useful approach

 </sup>. It is therefore important to explore alternative approaches to early warnings of abrupt change. Although conceptual models cannot replace studies based on observations and process-based modelling, they can help raise questions for future research. For example, it may be beneficial to compare abrupt monsoon changes on different time scales and in different regions: Are there common mechanisms behind the abrupt onsets in different monsoon systems on the planet? Are these mechanisms also responsible for abrupt monsoon shifts in palaeorecords? Is the expectation to see early warning signals before the occurrence of a certain shift supported by current process understanding? Will stronger El Niño events have irreversible consequences for tropical forest and savannah ecosystems? Was sea ice involved in a tipping point in the Earth’s history, and what was the role of periodic forcings? To explore such questions, it would be beneficial to further develop models of low to intermediate complexity in addition to existing Earth system models. Such a model hierarchy is most established in the case of sea ice models, but patchy in the case of ecosystems, and lacking in the case of monsoons. A suite of models that are easy to use would also better connect research attempts to understand different monsoon systems.
