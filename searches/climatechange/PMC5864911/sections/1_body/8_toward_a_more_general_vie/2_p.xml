<p id="Par37" class="p">In more realistic systems the drivers also have a more continuous spectrum. In models, the fast time scales in such spectra are often described by stochastic terms. The amplitude and period of the periodic oscillations we assumed above can be seen as an analogy for the typical magnitude and duration of random external fluctuations. Small changes in these statistical properties can lead to large and sometimes counter-intuitive changes in the distribution of a systemâ€™s state

 </sup>. In this regard, the concept of tipping points triggered by changes in periodic forcings is one representation of the fundamental question how vulnerable components of the Earth system are to environmental change. Theoretical progress has been made in recent decades to generalise concepts from bifurcation theory, for example by defining pullback attractors for deterministic non-autonomous systems
