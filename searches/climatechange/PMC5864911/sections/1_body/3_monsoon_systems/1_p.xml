<p id="Par17" class="p">Monsoon systems cover a large part of the subtropical land areas and supply many people with water. The most important monsoons occur in India, East Asia, West Africa, Australia and North and South America. The classical view of monsoon systems is that subtropical heat lows in summer induce a low-level circulation from the tropical ocean towards higher latitudes that supplies the subtropical land with moisture

 </sup>. Due to geographical differences between the monsoon regions, each monsoon system is usually studied on its own. However, observations from several monsoon systems show an intriguing asymmetry in the annual cycle of precipitation: while the onset of the monsoon rainfall in spring tends to occur rather abruptly, its retreat in autumn occurs much more gradually. Abrupt monsoon onsets have been observed in West Africa
