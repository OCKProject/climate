<p id="Par19" class="p">Despite the complexity and geographical differences between the monsoon systems, the widespread existence of sudden monsoon onsets invites describing them within the common concept of tipping points. In addition, the annual cycle of solar insolation is a cyclic driver of these systems. One could therefore speculate that monsoons are periodically driven bistable systems. As the monsoon circulation adjusts very quickly to its boundary conditions it would be best described as a system with a very small ratio

It then follows that a small shift in external conditions could bring the system into a regime where the bifurcation point of the monsoon onset is not reached anymore in a particular year. Indeed, past abrupt transitions between episodes of strong and weakened (“failed”) East Asian monsoon have been identified in Chinese cave records

 </sup>. These switches occur due to the oscillations of the Earth’s orbit that modulate summer insolation on the northern hemisphere. In this regard, the behavior of monsoons within a year and on timescales of hundred thousands of years is remarkably similar.
