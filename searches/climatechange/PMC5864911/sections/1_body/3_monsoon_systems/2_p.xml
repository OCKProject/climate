<p id="Par18" class="p">There are many potential reasons for abrupt monsoon onsets. First, meteorological theory predicts that switches from a zonal to a meridional flow can occur due to hydrodynamic instabilities when the atmosphere is sufficiently heated away from the equator

 </sup>. Second, air-sea interactions involving wind, evaporation, clouds and moisture advection can provide positive feedbacks which can rapidly enhance the monsoon after its onset

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">50</xref>
 </sup>. One important positive feedback results from the advection of moisture by the low-level monsoon flow. When this moisture condenses over land, the latent heat release further enhances the circulation. This feedback is at the heart of the monsoon model by
