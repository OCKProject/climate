  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">73</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">74</xref>
 </sup>: in a savannah ecosystem, fire occurs frequently and as grasses can quickly re-establish burned areas they outcompete the slower-growing tree saplings. In contrast, where a forest has established, fire is less likely to occur and the high tree cover can persist at the expense of grasses. Dynamic vegetation models indeed indicate that large subtropical land areas fall into a precipitation regime where several stable states are possible
