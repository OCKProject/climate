<p id="Par34" class="p">Moreover, precipitation is not strictly external, but interacts with vegetation. Such atmosphere-vegetation interaction is believed to be particularly large in Northern Africa due to positive surface-albedo and water cycle feedbacks

 </sup>. It has therefore been investigated if these feedbacks can give rise to multiple equilibria and whether the end of the Green Sahara some 5,500 years ago can be interpreted as a tipping point

 </sup>. Moreover, rainfall in Northern Africa shows large decadal variations. Climate models show that these variations are caused by SST changes in several ocean basins and that the Sahel drought of the 1970s and early 1980s was caused by such modes of natural climate variability

 </sup>. The time scale of these inter-annual fluctuations is of similar magnitude than the time scale of responses in grass coverage in such drylands. It is therefore plausible that rainfall fluctuations can lead to locally amplified shifts between a desert and a grass-covered state (representing a case like Fig.Â
