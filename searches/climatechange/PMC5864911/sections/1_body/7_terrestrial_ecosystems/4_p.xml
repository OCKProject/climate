 </sup> showed such abrupt shifts in a vegetation model with oscillating precipitation forcing. We reproduce their result in our Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> as another explicit model example (see Supplementary Information for model description). Despite the model differences, the results are directly comparable to our conceptual model above (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,d</xref>). At small amplitude, two alternative vegetation states exist. As soon as the amplitude becomes large enough, a bifurcation occurs, leading to an irreversible vegetation increase when starting from a desert state as an initial condition. At even larger amplitude, the rainfall variations now cover both equilibria and the mean vegetation cover drops to an intermediate average state while having much larger amplitude. Hence, a small change in the amplitude of rainfall fluctuations can result in a vegetation collapse or increase. As in the generic conceptual model above, the abruptness of the second (reversible) type of the transition depends on the timescale of the forcing relative to the relaxation time of the system (top versus bottom panel).
