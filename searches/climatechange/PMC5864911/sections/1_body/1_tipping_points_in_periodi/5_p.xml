<p id="Par10" class="p">A similar result is obtained when D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> is increased (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c,f</xref>) because the relaxation toward the lower branch becomes too strong. A systematic sampling of the parameter space spanned by D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>, D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> and T shows that D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> and T essentially have a very similar effect in the model (Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>,
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>) as they both reduce the D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>-range in which multiple solutions occur. When both become large, the dependence on initial conditions is destroyed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). This is due to another type of abrupt transition, which occurs at D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 0.8 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>. At this point, the system reaches a regime where it makes a full cycle involving both branches of the equilibrium system, flipping up and down between the branches (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2g</xref>). As the system’s response becomes very slow at the bifurcation point of the equilibrium system, the transition to the alternative state occurs after the bifurcation point is reached

 </sup>. Nonetheless, if the driver’s amplitude is large enough, two abrupt shifts occur within each full cycle of the system under constant parameter conditions. When this regime becomes active, the amplitude of the solution increases rapidly with D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>. In contrast to the bifurcations mentioned previously, such sudden amplitude change is reversible: for intermediate D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>, there are no multiple solutions because all movement occurs along one continuous stable branch far from the second one above. When D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> increases, the driver suddenly encloses both bifurcation points. During a cycle, the system now switches to the upper branch, but falls down again later on the other side. It should be noted that the amplitude change is only a sharp transition if T is sufficiently large (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref> with 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2d</xref>). Otherwise, the time is too short for the system to get close to the alternative branch to which it is suddenly attracted in a short period during each cycle.
