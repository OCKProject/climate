<p id="Par12" class="p">The ratio between τ and the driver’s period T determines the abruptness of every one of the transitions discussed above. Three regimes can be distinguished: when 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> ≫ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>, the system closely follows the stable state of the equilibrium system. This limit case is usually addressed with the classical tipping point concept. When 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> ≪ 
 <italic class="italic">τ</italic>, the system cannot follow the rapid forcing at all and remains static. It can then be described with an equivalent time-independent system. In the intermediate regime, where the time scales of the system and driver are similar, irreversible amplitude or timescale-induced shifts can occur.
