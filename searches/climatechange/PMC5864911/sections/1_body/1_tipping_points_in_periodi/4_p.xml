<p id="Par9" class="p">Our conceptual model is hence determined by Eqs 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="" class="xref">2</xref>, and is well-known as the overdamped limit of the Duffing oscillator. We integrate the system for different sets of the three parameters, D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>, D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> and T, until it reaches a stable attractor in form of a periodic oscillation. Like the driver, the system’s solution is periodic in time with period T (also involving harmonics that can arise close to a bifurcation point)

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> illustrates how the periodic solutions of the system can change when one of the three parameters is varied. Varying D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) is similar to the classical scenario of a tipping point, only that the stable solutions oscillate in time: if D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> is increased across the bifurcation, the upper branch of stable solutions disappears and the system has to shift to the lower branch. Interestingly, such tipping-point behavior can also be obtained by increasing the driver’s period T or its amplitude D
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>, without any change in D
 <sub class="sub">m</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b–d</xref>). For example, when the driver is fast (small T) the system regularly passes the bifurcation point of the equilibrium system but returns in time to keep the system close to the upper branch. Therefore, there can be two alternative periodic solutions. However, when the driver becomes slower, the system destabilizes and propels itself toward the only remaining solution around the lower branch. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2e</xref> illustrates this forced transition as a blue trajectory in the phase space spanned by driver D and state x.
