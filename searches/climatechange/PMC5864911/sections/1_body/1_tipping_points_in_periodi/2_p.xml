D is an external (prescribed) driver representing environmental conditions, which makes the system non-autonomous (meaning that it explicitly depends on time). In case the driver D changes slowly enough, the system follows a stable equilibrium branch which ends at a bifurcation point. After the driver passes this point the system switches to the remaining stable equilibrium – the case of a classical tipping point.
