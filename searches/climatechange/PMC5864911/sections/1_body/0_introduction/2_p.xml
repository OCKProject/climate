<p id="Par3" class="p">In the conventional illustration of a tipping point it is assumed that the driver (representing external conditions), varies monotonically and gradually, so that the system stays close to a stable equilibrium (black curve in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>). However, many environmental conditions change so rapidly that the system’s state cannot catch up with the changing equilibrium. For example, global warming can drive the Greenland ice sheet into a regime where it is not sustainable anymore

 </sup>. However, the ice sheet can take millennia to melt completely, which gives us a window of “borrowed time”
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup> in which we could save the ice-sheet should the temperature decrease again in time

 </sup>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> illustrates the two possibilities of a saved (blue) and a collapsing system (red). As the excursion beyond the threshold takes more time for the red trajectory, the system shifts to the realm of the lower stable branch, while the blue trajectory returns toward its old state.
