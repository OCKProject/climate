<p id="Par4" class="p">As natural systems are permanently exposed to environmental change, they are usually not in equilibrium. The external fluctuations that drive them are usually simplified as stochastic, but in reality there often is a dominant timescale as well. This is particularly obvious if the change in external conditions consists in a periodic oscillation, for example the very regular annual and diurnal cycles of solar insolation, and the quasi-periodic changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters. Also, the climate system’s internal variability shows modes with specific frequency ranges, most importantly the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
