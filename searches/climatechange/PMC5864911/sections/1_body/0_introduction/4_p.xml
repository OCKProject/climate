<p id="Par5" class="p">Such oscillations will affect parts of the climate system or ecosystems that have intrinsic thresholds or bifurcations: a gradual change in the mean, amplitude or frequency of periodic drivers can trigger abrupt change in these systems. In the following, we first illustrate these phenomena with a simple mathematical system. Subsequently, we point out how models and observations indicate the existence of these phenomena in many elements of the Earth system, spanning a vast range of time scales. We illustrate some consequences of this view for monsoon systems, sea ice and terrestrial ecosystems, and argue how a general view on tipping points can contribute to a conceptual understanding of different tipping elements in the Earth system.</p>
