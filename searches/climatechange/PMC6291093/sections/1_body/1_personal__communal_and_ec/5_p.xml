<p class="p">What is of particular novelty in this paper is our interrogation of cranberry growers’ relationship with ecological conditions of production. How growers have interacted with specific weather patterns and other conditions that affect cranberry harvests over the long-term likely has an effect on how growers interpret climate change. O’Connor [

For cranberry growers, personal conditions influence how one approaches their cranberry operation, but access to ecological conditions is also important, especially access to an abundance of water, as we will see below. Communal conditions, which include the rights that society (through the state) grants cranberry growers to use protected areas for their water, is also important, as is the cultural importance that society places on cranberry bogs in the landscape, and the sense of sharing that goes on between growers. We would expect that having direct ownership of these natural resources would have an effect on growers’ perceptions of their own vulnerability to climate change, because ownership provides immediate, unequivocal access to resources whenever needed. Studies on the political ecology of inhabited protected areas suggest that ownership of resources and land has an impact on how people engage with issues of resilience and perceptions of the natural environment (Cf.
