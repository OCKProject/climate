<p class="p">Communal conditions of production are the social and physical infrastructures required for economies to operate, but oftentimes are not a part of specific production platforms [

Roads, communication, education systems, and extension networks would all be considered communal conditions that allow cranberry production to happen. Importantly, O’Connor points to the cultural dimensions of communal conditions, where society reproduces the conditions necessary for certain economic activities to take place. The importance of cranberries in one of America’s most symbolic and celebrated holidays (Thanksgiving), the cultural importance of cranberries to the development of Massachusetts (e.g. drawing several hundred thousand tourists worldwide to the annual Cranberry Harvest Festival, held in Wareham, MA), and the value that policymakers and local citizens place on the importance of agricultural land (cranberry bogs in this case) for a thriving social and ecological landscape are all outside the realm of cranberry production but part of what allows it to persist (see also [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]). Communal conditions provide the social framework in which actors operate, where norms of sharing advice, equipment, access to water in adjacent wetlands, and other resources can be created to allow livelihoods to persist even in difficult situations. Therefore, we can consider farmers’ attitudes towards climate change as being constituted partly by the cultural fabric of the cranberry community. Asking questions, then, about global warming attitudes is to interrogate a facet of the communal conditions of production.
