<p class="p">Cranberries are distinctive from other cropping systems in a number of ways. First, cranberries require between 1,000 and 2,500 chill hours (accumulated hours between 0°C (32
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>F) and 7.2°C (45
 <sup class="sup">∘</sup>F) depending on the variety, which is more than other temperate fruit crops. This is an important distinction, because in New England the average monthly high temperature is rising across winter months and at a faster rate and with higher variability than in summer months (

Accumulating sufficient chill hours allows the cranberry plants to break dormancy and begin to develop once temperature and length-of-day are favorable. When winter temperatures rise above 7.2°C (45°F) for an extended time, there is a risk that cranberry bud development will be impaired. Dormant mixed-terminal buds (buds that will bloom next year) fail to develop when exposed to less than 1,000 chill hours, and the more chill hours accumulated above the 1,000 requirement the shorter the amount of days to bud break [
