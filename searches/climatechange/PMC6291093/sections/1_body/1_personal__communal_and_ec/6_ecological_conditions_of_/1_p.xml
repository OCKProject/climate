 <italic class="italic">Vaccinium macrocarpon</italic>, is a temperate perennial wetland plant native to northeastern North America.

Commercial cranberry bogs were first established in Massachusetts in the 1800s in peat-filled, impermeable kettle holes formed from glacial deposits. Many of the original kettle bogs are still in production today [
