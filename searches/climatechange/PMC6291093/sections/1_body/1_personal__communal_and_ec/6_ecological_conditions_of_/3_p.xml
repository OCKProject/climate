<p class="p">Second, there are no crop rows or furrows in a cranberry bog; the soil is completely covered with vines forming a thick mat that extends over the entire bog. The perennial cover that cranberries provide conserves soil and prevents the establishment of annual weeds, but perennial weeds that spread in the cranberry understory and underground via stolons and rhizomes, can significantly depress cranberry yields [

The bogs are seasonally flooded in the fall for harvest, in the winter for protection, and in the spring for pest management. Flood water is controlled with a system of ditches, dykes, and gates that allow the water to flow from a bog of higher elevation to another of lower elevation. Sharing water for seasonal flooding is a typical cultural practice among cranberry growers, a communal condition that has allowed production to be sustained in the region. Fourth, cranberries are grown as a monoculture; the acidic soil conditions, growth habit of the cranberry plant, and periodic flooding, limits the opportunities for intercropping and crop rotation. Although, fifth, intra-specific genetic diversity can be high with several varieties of cranberries, including ones from the 1800s, growing in a single bog. Sixth, and important for climate mitigation, cranberry bogs likely sequester more carbon than they release due to zero tillage, the periodic practice of sanding, which buries the cranberry vines (organic carbon) to stimulate new growth and buds, and the conservation of carbon-rich peat in the peat-based bogs.
