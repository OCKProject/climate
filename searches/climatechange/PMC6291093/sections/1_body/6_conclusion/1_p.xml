<p class="p">Massachusetts cranberry bogs are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts due to their high chill hours requirements, perennial habit (making them harder to re-establish in a new bog or rotate with other crops for pest control), and their high dependence on great quantities of water. However, we found that cranberry growers, with the exception of women, are generally less concerned about global warming than the average American, despite the fact that increasing temperatures and more variable precipitation are predicted for the region. We suggest two main reasons for this trend: one that growers may lean more politically conservative than the average American, as is typical of many American farmers [

As a grower told one of us, “this year it’s drought, next year it’ll be too much water” (personal communication). Thus, lack of concern must be taken in the context of their overall concern in dealing with the elements of weather. Because of the annual production cycle of cranberries (managing frosts in the spring, pests in the summer, water for wet harvest in the fall), growers are likely too absorbed in the challenges of the growing cycle to be concerned about long-term climatic changes. Somehow they have always managed to get by and in fact, the average cranberry yield per acre has been increasing due to the introduction of new high yielding varieties from Rutgers University (See Rutgers Licensing and Technology: Agricultural Products website,

However, when global warming reduces the number of chill hours accumulated during the winter below the requirements for successful cranberry bud development, it is likely that cranberry growers will experience a novel growing environment and cranberry production in Massachusetts will take a big economic hit. Perhaps then concern over global warming will increase among all cranberry growers. Thus, personal, communal and ecological conditions of cranberry production have distinct effects on how cranberry growers approach both their cranberry growing operation and broader ecological changes impacting the world. What is worth further investigation in particular is the finding that women cranberry farmers, who tend to be more worried about global warming, might be important agents for community adaptation to a warming New England.
