<p class="p">Our study, the first of its kind on cranberry production, suggests that ecological conditions also matter a great deal. Cranberry growers’ attitudes on climate change are shaped in part by the ecological landscape in which they are enmeshed. This finding is particularly important because cranberry growers on average manage more than three times as much upland and wetland habitat than acres of cranberry bog. The cranberry production landscape is a mosaic of peaty cranberry bogs, man-made cranberry bogs, forest, meadow, ponds, streams, rivers, and suburban habitat, and it turns out that the amount of upland and wetland habitat a grower has makes a difference in the grower’s concern over climate change. Growers will need to take advantage of its tight-knit communal conditions in order to attempt to sustain this production system in a warming New England.</p>
