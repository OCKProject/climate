<p class="p">In January 2016, a solicitation to participate in our ninety-seven question survey was disseminated to all the approximately four hundred cranberry growers of Massachusetts with contact information held by either the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, and/or the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association (CCCGA). The U-Mass Cranberry Station emailed the solicitation to its list of growers, and the CCCGA posted an advertisement to participate in their monthly newsletter,

Subsequently, the researchers mailed a hard copy of the solicitation, along with the survey and postage-paid return envelopes, to all growers on the CCCGA mailing list who had not returned the survey (The names of these members, and their contact information, was not released to the researchers in order to maintain CCCGA membership privacy). Online respondents read a consent form explaining the nature of the study prior to answering questions, and respondents to the mailed survey were given a hard copy to review prior to answering the questions. This research complies with ethical practices and was approved by the Boston College Institutional Review Board (Protocol number 12.139.01e) prior to disseminating the survey. Survey respondents were assured that their identities would be kept anonymous in any publications using these data. We received ninety-one responses out of roughly four hundred cranberry growers, approximately twenty-three percent of the grower population (

For a population that is much less varied than the general public (predominantly Caucasian, all from the same region in Massachusetts), this is an adequate sample size with between a ± 5 percent and ± 10 percent sampling error at the 95 percent confidence level [
