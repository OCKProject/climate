 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Specific reported ecological conditions, such as water availability, increasing temperatures, pest pressures, etc. will have more of an effect on global warming attitudes because cranberry bogs are embedded in a diverse landscape and highly dependent on water resources, appropriate temperatures for bud and fruit development, and pest management. Thus we would expect that growers who report greater pest pressure, will see global warming as a greater threat. Similarly, growers who report low access to water resources, will be more likely to view global warming as a threat or to worry about it.</p>

 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Increased ownership of ecological conditions of production, especially water but also dry upland habitat, will have an inverse effect on attitudes towards the importance of global warming, because increased access to these ecological conditions of production buffer growers from the negative effects of global warming. The novelty of cranberry production might explain why this hypothesis has not previously been tested in other studies.</p>
