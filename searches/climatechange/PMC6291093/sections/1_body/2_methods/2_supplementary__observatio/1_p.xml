<p class="p">Our survey responses are informed by observations while gathering ecological data over the past eight years at bog sites in the region, as well as formal and informal interviews with cranberry growers. Interview data are limited here, but will be central to future publications. One of the authors (Pisani Gareau) has been gathering ecological data, from 2015 –present, on bog-insect-weed interactions in a warming climate that are part of the authors’ larger interdisciplinary research project. This work has led to multiple conversations with dozens of cranberry growers that have helped us discern our survey results and draw conclusions from the findings. Two authors (Pisani Gareau and Gareau), along with research team members, have conducted twenty interviews between 2012 and 2018 with cranberry growers to learn more about the history of cranberry production, as well as grower attitudes towards environmental conditions, including climate change. These interviews helped us make sense of survey results as well, contributing to our understanding of personal and communal conditions of cranberry production in particular.</p>
