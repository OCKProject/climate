<p class="p">Group Three measures cranberry growers’ access to important ecological conditions/natural resources. Upland habitat acreage and wetland habitat acreage are self-reported sizes of upland habitat (meadow, forest, etc.) and wetland habitat (swamps, dug ponds, etc.) within each respondent’s farm. As discussed above, upland and wetland habitat ownership are important ecological conditions of production due to the access to water they provide, as well as habitat to pollinators and other beneficial insects. Water is a critical component to cranberry production throughout the year, and growers have varying levels of access to it. Acres of upland habitat, wetland habitat, and cranberry bog are measured in tens of acres and are top-coded to correct for outliers with extremely large values. We also include a variable that measures the relative size of natural habitat (of both types) as percentage of total farm size.</p>
