<p class="p">Communal conditions are discussed in the context of our findings. Understanding the role that cranberry production plays in the Massachusetts cranberry growing region helps us discern the attitudes that growers hold, and gives us insights into the ways that the grower community approaches both their operation, but also issues associated with climate change. As discussed above, the communal conditions of cranberry production form a social network of tight-knitted growers and community members interested in seeing this industry survive in the Massachusetts landscape. Through site visits and in-depth interviews, the researchers recognize that growers are oftentimes very familiar with the bogs of neighboring growers, sometimes sharing equipment, water, and knowledge of local pests and other nuisances. Growers participate together in workshops held by the University of Massachusetts Cranberry Station, or the Cape Cod Cranberry Growers Association. Additionally, many growers participate in the annual cranberry harvest festival, and other events. The majority of growers are members of either the grower cooperative, Ocean Spray, or are connected to the private business, Decas, adding another level of networking to this agricultural production platform. Finally, cranberry growers are a rather small group, numbering around four hundred in total in Massachusetts, and they are clustered geographically in Southeastern Massachusetts.</p>
