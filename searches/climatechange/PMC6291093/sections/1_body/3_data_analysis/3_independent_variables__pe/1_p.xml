<p class="p">We include educational attainment, age group, and gender of cranberry growers as independent variables of

We do not explicitly control for political ideology or party affiliation because we know from our years of conducting research on cranberries that this is a sensitive question that can be disruptive to researcher/grower collaboration. However, we did ask questions about how climate change is portrayed in the media as a proxy for political orientation, as past studies have shown that people with conservative political affiliations are more skeptical about media coverage of global warming. Descriptive statistics of the overall sample are provided in
