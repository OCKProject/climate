<p class="p">For each outcome, we estimate separate models that include one of the three groups of key independent variables, and a full model that includes selected independent variables from all three groups. Model 1 includes all independent variables on general ecological conditions as well as personal conditions of production. Model 2 includes all independent variables on specific ecological conditions. Model 3 includes a selected subset of 6 variables on specific ecological conditions that are more directly related to climate change as well as personal conditions of production. Model 4 includes all independent variables on ownership of ecological conditions/natural resources (such as upland habitat acreage). Model 5 is the full model. We exclude additional control variables in Model 2 to preserve degrees of freedom. We exclude total cranberry acreage in Models 4 and 5 to avoid extreme multi-collinearity. Due to a constraint on the degrees of freedom posed by the small sample size, we are unable to include in the full models all independent variables, so we select independent variables based on the need for hypothesis testing, as well as the statistical significance tests of variables in prior, separate models. The sample size varies slightly across models due to the missing data for certain independent variables.</p>
