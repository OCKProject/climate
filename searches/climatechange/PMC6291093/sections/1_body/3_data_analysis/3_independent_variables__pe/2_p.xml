<p class="p">For the binary outcome 
 <italic class="italic">global warming threat</italic>, we estimate logistic regression models. For the ordinal outcome 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic>, we estimate generalized ordered logit regression models. This modeling technique tests for each independent variable if the proportional odds assumption is violated. If it is violated for an independent variable, the estimator generates multiple coefficients, each coefficient corresponding to a cut point in the ordinal outcome. Otherwise, the estimator generates one coefficient for each independent variable. This modeling technique is less restrictive than the proportional odds models but more parsimonious than multinomial models [
