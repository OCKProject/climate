<p class="p">We model two dependent variables on attitudes toward global warming. The first variable, used as well by McCright, Dunlap, and Xiao [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>] 
 <italic class="italic">global warming threat</italic>, measures the binary responses to the survey item “Do you think that global warming will pose a serious threat to you or your way of life in your lifetime?” (1 = yes, 0 = no). Cranberry growers have an intimate connection to their surrounding landscape, including its weather, and so we expect they can identify long-term changes that might escape other actors, especially among conservative populations. Thus, we expect that cranberry growers in general will view global warming as a threat in their lifetime. Since growers report being more skeptical of global warming in general, it is possible that some connections to the landscape have an impact on attitudes. The second dependent variable, also examined by Dunlap, McCright, and Yarosh [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>] and Chong [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>] in terms of political division, 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic>, measures ordinal responses to the survey item “Please tell us how much you personally worry about global warming?” (a 1 to 4 scale: “not worry at all” to “worry a great deal”). Given the socio-ecological relationship between cranberry growers and ecological conditions of production (chill hour requirements, water availability, pollinators, etc.), we anticipate that Massachusetts cranberry growers are more concerned about global warming than the average American.
