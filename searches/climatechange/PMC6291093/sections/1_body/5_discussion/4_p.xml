<p class="p">Temperature changes, however, are another matter for cranberry growers. Insufficient chill hours during winter were positively associated with 
 <italic class="italic">global warming threat</italic> with good reason. Unlike drought or flooding, there is nothing cranberry growers can do for their plants to compensate for insufficient freezing temperatures. Although if cranberry plants break dormancy early in spring, growers manage the risk of frost damage by regularly irrigating the fields. Through in-depth interviews and observations, we understand from growers that this is arduous work as it entails periodically testing all the sprinkler heads throughout the night and dawn. As one grower said to us, “we’d prefer that the bogs stay covered in snow until the end of April” (personal communication), because then the plants, with more than sufficient chill hours met, break dormancy and develop without the constant threat of a damaging frost. Unfortunately opportunities for long cold winters are slipping away as winter months are getting warmer and more variable. For example, on 21 Feb 2018 the high temperature in Boston was 22.2°C at 12 pm; 24 hours later the temperature was 3.8°C–a difference of more than 18°C. If growers are to maintain their production amid warming temperatures, they will need to rely on communal conditions, on a community network of support, increased input from extension, the development of new cranberry varieties with lower chill hour requirements and frost tolerance, and likely increased support from the state.
