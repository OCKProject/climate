We know from our observations that many cranberry growers are women, women who are responsible for all aspects of their cranberry growing operation, while a larger percentage of women are involved in cranberry production as a family business, from managing the books and labor to participating in the harvest. Women cranberry growers might thus play an important role in climate change adaptation and raising awareness among what is a relatively small community of cranberry growers. As we know, communal conditions of production involve both infrastructural and cultural connections that allow for economic activities to flourish, and this tight-knit community could learn from the knowledge of this sub-group. Education to the extent of receiving a bachelor's degree was the threshold for being more concerned about global warming. People with less education as well as people with graduate education showed less concern for global warming. This pattern concurs with McCright and Dunlapâ€™s findings which demonstrated that white, well-educated males were most skeptical about climate change [
