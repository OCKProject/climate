<p class="p">It seems surprising that water scarcity and competition for water were not associated positively with global warming attitudes. However, New England is a region with a history of variable precipitation, such that cranberry growers have long dealt with deficits in precipitation as much as higher than normal precipitation. Furthermore, technologies to level fields, pump water, and drain bogs has made it easier for growers to manage water variability. We posit that cranberry bogs are one of the most resistant systems to drought and flooding, because they are naturally low in the landscape where water accumulates, the water table sits below a thick layer of water absorbent peat (one of the authors has walked on peat-based bogs that felt like walking on a water bed), and bogs have a system of ditches, levees, and gates to allow water to move through them and be released in times of flood. Additionally, communal conditions allow growers to share water resources, helping each other during drought times. In sum, while water is critical to the growth and harvest of cranberries, it is something that cranberry growers are accustomed to managing collectively under variable precipitation levels.</p>
