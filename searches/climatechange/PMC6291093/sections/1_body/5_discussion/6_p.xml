<p class="p">Besides the importance of chill hours the most revealing finding for us is the importance of the ownership of certain ecological conditions of production over others. While both wetland and upland habitat were associated with global warming attitudes, an increase in wetland habitat increases odds of worry while an increase in upland habitat reduces those odds. We suspect that this has to do with the intimate relationship that cranberry growers have to their surrounding landscape; the style of cranberry growing might be the reason for this finding. This meshes with scholarship in political ecology that identifies varying environmental attitudes, perceptions of ‘nature,’ and interest in working to resolve community-level environmental problems among small-scale farmers [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Cranberry growers are deeply dependent on water throughout the year to maintain a healthy harvest, making them likely to be much attuned to the effects that a warming region is having on its water supply. Additionally, drought and flooding can be seen in water levels, providing a visual cue that conditions are not average. It is possible that the growers who own wetland habitat have greater awareness of the effects on water, on their ability to use it when in need, even if they do not necessarily associate this with its impact on cranberry growing itself. On the other hand, simply having access to an abundance of dry upland habitat might act as a buffer to anxiety about a changing climate because owning land can be a powerful feeling. The upland habitat may be exploited to expand cranberry bog production or for other purposes, such as timber. However, we stress that we are speculating here and would suggest further research on these intriguing trends should follow.
