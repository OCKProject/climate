<p class="p">Why is it that cranberry growers, who report that conditions are getting worse for cranberry production, are not particularly worried about global warming when their production system depends on ecological means of production in ways that are distinctive from other production systems? We anticipated that the highly integrated social and ecological system of cranberry production along with observed changes to the ecological conditions would override any conservative bias, which can downplay global warming as a serious threat. While we did not explicitly ask about political party affiliation or political leaning, growersâ€™ answers to a survey question about their opinions on the seriousness of global warming portrayed in the media suggests that this population sample may also holds conservative views about global warming.</p>
