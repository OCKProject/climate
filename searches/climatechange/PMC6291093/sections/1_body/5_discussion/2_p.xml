<p class="p">However, with almost half of the sample reporting some concern over global warming and the majority reporting some concern, if only a little, cranberry growers’ climate change attitudes are more nuanced than being described simply as “skeptical.” Our findings shed light on the complex relationship between personal, communal, and ecological conditions of cranberry production and the attitudes held of Massachusetts cranberry growers on climate change. Drawing from these conditions helps us understand the context in which cranberry growers are embedded, helping us discover the social and ecological situation that contributes to attitudes on global climate change. We find that some conditions create openings in which climate change discussions have meaning to cranberry livelihoods. For one, growers that report weather as an important condition are more likely to see global warming as a threat. Weather is a broad phenomenon that can be felt and described over time, from season to season and, culturally, from generation to generation.</p>
