<p class="p">Our data suggest that cranberry growers are more skeptical of the threat of global warming than the average American citizen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0207237.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). As we expected (Hypothesis I) cranberry growers are more likely to think that global warming will pose a serious threat to their way of life during their lifetimes than the general public (41% in comparison to 36%), but it is important to point out that 57% of cranberry growers do not think global warming is a threat to cranberry production. Contrary to our expectation, we found only 33% of the sample population reported feeling worried a fair amount to a great deal about global warming. In comparison 45% of the American public is worried about global warming. When asked how climate change is portrayed in the media, 43% of cranberry growers thought that global warming was “generally exaggerated” in comparison to 34% of the American public.
