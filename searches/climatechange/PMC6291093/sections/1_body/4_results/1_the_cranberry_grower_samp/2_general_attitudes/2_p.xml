<p class="p">In sum, the majority of cranberry growers do not see global warming as threatening to their way of life and are generally not too worried about it, and slightly less than half think the seriousness of global warming is exaggerated in the media. Looked at another way, we find that the cranberry population is almost split down the middle between a group that recognizes the threat of climate change and is a little to very concerned about it and a group that does not view global warming as a threat and is not worried about it. To understand what predicts those differences, we look next to ecological and personal conditions of production.</p>
