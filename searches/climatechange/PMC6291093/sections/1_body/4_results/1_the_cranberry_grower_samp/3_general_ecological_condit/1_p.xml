 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Based on Model 5, a one-unit increase (on a 5-point scale) of the reported importance of weather-related issues increases the odds of a grower considering global warming as a serious threat by 173.1% (2.731–1), holding other independent variables constant. Similarly, for each additional type of weather-related event a grower reports that severely affected their cranberry production, the odds of this grower considering global warming as a serious threat increases by 122.2% (2.222–1). In other words, growers who mention more weather-related events severely affecting their production, are much more likely to report global warming as a threat. These results support Hypothesis I, that growers reporting worsening ecological conditions will place greater importance on global warming.
