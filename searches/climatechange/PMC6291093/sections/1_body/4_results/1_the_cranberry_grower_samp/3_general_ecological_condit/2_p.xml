 <italic class="italic">Global warming worry</italic> was analyzed with parameterizations similar to the models in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>, the only difference being that the importance of high temperatures in summer is statistically significant in Models 2 and 3 and is thus added to Model 5 (the full model). In Models 1, 4, and 5, we report three odds ratio for the personal condition variable 
 <italic class="italic">female</italic> because it violates the proportional odds assumption (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). The outcome 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic> has 3 cut points: worry a little bit or more vs. not worry at all; worry a fair amount or a great deal vs. not worry at all or worry a little bit; worry a great deal vs. worry a fair amount or less. Variables that measure general ecological conditions of production are not associated with 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic> in Model 1, although 
 <italic class="italic">general ecological conditions</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">weather counts</italic> both become positively associated with 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic> in Model 5. Odds of worrying more about global warming increases by 227.3% (3.273–1) for growers who think the general conditions for cranberry production are getting worse, holding other predictors constant. Similarly, each additional type of weather-related event a grower reports affecting cranberry production increases the odds of this grower worrying more about global warming by 47.5% (1.475–1), shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>.
