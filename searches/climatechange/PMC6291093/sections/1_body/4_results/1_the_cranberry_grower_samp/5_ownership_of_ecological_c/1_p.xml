<p class="p">The results provide mixed evidence for Hypothesis III––
 <italic class="italic">increased ownership of ecological conditions of production will have an inverse effect on attitudes towards the importance of global warming</italic>. We found that cranberry growers who have access to larger amounts of natural habitat relative to their farm size are less likely to consider global warming as a serious threat (Model 5), such that a one percentage point increase in the relative size of natural habitats (% total farm size) reduces the odds of a grower considering global warming as a serious threat by 4.3% (i.e., 1–0.957) (

 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic>. Looking more specifically at the types of habitat, we found that growers who have access to larger amounts of upland habitat (in actual acreage) are less likely to worry about global warming, supporting Hypothesis III. However, those who have access to larger amounts of wetland habitat are more likely to worry about global warming, which works against Hypothesis III. According to Model 5, a 10-acre increase in the size of wetland habitat that a grower can access increases the odds of this grower worrying more about global warming by 15.2% (1.152–1), as shown in 
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t004" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 4</xref>. This suggests that access to specific natural resources and habitat, as opposed to their ownership in general, and farm size are important to consider and can have different effects.
