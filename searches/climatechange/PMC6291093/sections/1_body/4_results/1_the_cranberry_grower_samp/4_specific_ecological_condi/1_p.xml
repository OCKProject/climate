<p class="p">The only specific environmental variables that are associated with 
 <italic class="italic">global warming worry</italic> relate to temperature–the importance of high temperatures in summer and insufficient chill hours in winter, only partly supporting Hypothesis II. Based on Model 5, a one-unit increase (on a 5-point scale) in the reported importance of the insufficient chill hours in winter increases the odds of a grower considering global warming as a serious threat by to 90.1% (1.901–1) and worrying more about global warming by 94.7% (1.947–1). In contrast, a one-unit increase in the reported importance of high temperatures in summer reduces the odds of a grower worrying more about global warming by 53.7% (1–0.463). Said another way, growers who report worsening insufficient chill hours in winter are more likely to see global warming as a threat and worry more about it, while the opposite is observed for growers who report worsening high temperatures in summer (
