 <xref rid="pone.0207237.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>, pointing out some important characteristics of the sample population. The 91 cranberry growers who participated in the survey were mostly men older than 55 years of age. Generally, the population is less likely to see 
 <italic class="italic">global warming as a threat</italic> (mean = 0.42, where 0 = no and 1 = yes). Growers are only a little worried about global warming (mean = 2.21 ±0.89 SD on a 1–4 scale where 0 = not worry at all and 4 = worry a great deal). Although, the majority of growers reported that conditions in general for cranberry production were getting worse (mean = 0.70 ±0.46 SD). Particularly noteworthy, growers report insect pests, weed pests, and disease as important environmental conditions (means &gt; 4.0 on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 = not important and 5 = very important). Growers on average manage 40.7 acres of cranberry bogs, with the minimum acreage of 1 acres and a maximum of 200. On average growers have access to 39.4 acres of wetland habitat and 102.6 acres of upland habitat. Thus on average for every acre of cranberry bog, growers manage 3.5 acres of natural habitat.
