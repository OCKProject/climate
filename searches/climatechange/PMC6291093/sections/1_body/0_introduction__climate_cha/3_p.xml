<p class="p">In the United States (US), agricultural systems are among the most vulnerable economic sectors to climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. While increases in atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and lengthening of the growing season has generally increased plant productivity, including for several important grain crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], throughout much of the US in the 20th century [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], drought and extreme temperatures occurring during critical growth periods relate to higher yield variability for annual crops [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The negative impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to increase over time [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Yet, the effects and impacts of climate change are heterogeneous across the US [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. For instance, the frost free season has lengthened by 2 to 3 weeks in the Western US, 1 to 2 weeks in the Northeast and Midwest, and less than 1 week in the Southeast [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. A longer growing season in the Northeast and Midwest can have the positive effect of increasing opportunities to grow subtropical and tropical crops for those growers willing to try new crops. Yet grain crops tend to perform worse under a warming trend especially under extreme heat during pollination and grain filling [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Yield models with low and high emissions scenarios predict declining yields for California’s maize, wheat, cotton, and sunflower and slightly increased yields for alfalfa [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Perennial temperate crops that require a period of winter dormancy, known as chilling hours or vernalization, are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases in the winter.
