<p class="p">Surface air temperature has increased in the Northeastern United States at a faster rate than the global trend of about 1°C since 1880 [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. According to Blue Hill Observatory, one of the oldest weather stations in the United States and 30 miles south of Boston, Massachusetts, the mean annual temperature from the most recent 30-yr period of 1988 to 2017 was 9.6°C, which is 1.9°C warmer than the mean temperature between 1881 and 1910 of 7.7°C, and 2.08°C warmer than the 30-year average between 1831 and 1860 of 7.5°C (

Unlike other perennial crops, cranberries have a narrow niche breadth, requiring a specific set of ecological conditions that must be met for adequate yields to be achieved and to avoid crop failure. Additionally, cranberry growers necessarily establish an intimate relationship with their surrounding landscapes due to their dependency on various natural resources, such as large quantities of water at multiples times of the year and pollinating insects [

Associated effects of global warming, such as extended droughts, increased precipitation in shorter time periods, and an increase in pressure from insect, weed, and disease pests, further challenge the sustainability of cranberry production.
