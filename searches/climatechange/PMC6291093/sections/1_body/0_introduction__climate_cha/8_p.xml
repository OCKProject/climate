<p class="p">Below, we use a social theoretical approach to help us comprehend grower attitudes in their broader context. Data were gathered with a survey distributed to cranberry growers in Massachusetts, supplemented (less centrally in this paper) with observations of cranberry production at multiple research site visits as well as in-depth and informal interviews. Specifically, we draw from O’Connor’s theorization of the

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>]. This frame allows us to take seriously the attitudes that growers hold vis-a-vis their livelihoods, access to resources, and other production conditions. Investigating conditions both on and off the cranberry operation proper helps us discern how specific cranberry growing conditions in one context might differ from those of another, thus contributing to differences in attitudes towards global climatic change.
