<p class="p">Regarding views of climate change and the perceived risks to agriculture, Chatrchyan et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] provide a comprehensive review of the literature from within the US context. The authors find that farmers’ attitudes towards climate change, and its anthropogenic nature, vary across studies based on region and agricultural system. The findings suggest that “farmers relate to climate change based on their own experiences with its impacts,” but that views about its anthropogenic nature are harder to link to causal explanations, though are likely connected to farmer’s predominantly conservative political views [
 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Studies from around the US rather consistently report that American farmers hold conservative political views that likely influence their attitude towards climate change, leading to a disconnect between local experience of climatic changes and ‘global knowledge’ of global climate change as reported by the scientific community (See [
