<p class="p">Due to variability in the effects of climate change, scholars point to the need to understand the local context of agriculture so that adaptation efforts may be tailored to the specific social and ecological circumstances of agricultural systems [

 <xref rid="pone.0207237.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The call to focus on the local context is not limited to agriculture, but rather is found in a range of literatures recognizing local sites where climate change will be engaged with in meaningful ways due to the ways in which ecological conditions become entangled in social, political, and economic conditions on the ground in locally-specific arrangements [

As actors operating in agriculture, growers acquire an intimate understanding of their landscape, yet that understanding does not always translate into attitudes and action that form links between local and global systems. Studies of relevance to this paper engaging in this terrain range from: 1) comparisons between (and deviations from) local and regional observations of climate change and the global consensus on its effects (for a thorough review of nearly one hundred studies in this area, see [
