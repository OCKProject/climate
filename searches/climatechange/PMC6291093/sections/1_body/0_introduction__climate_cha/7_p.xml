Yet, the agricultural community–especially extension agents and others operating in the land grant system–are often working to find ways to connect local experiences with climatic change to mitigation and adaptation strategies through education, even among growers who are primarily white males. As people making a living through agriculture, extension agents in some cases work to tap into the “experiential learning” that some growers and farmers in their region have received as climatic changes effects become increasingly difficult to ignore, leading to some farmers making connections to the reality of global warming [

Here, strategies that have been the most successful take the local context into account so that the proposed changes to agricultural systems make sense given the specific conditions of the farmers who need to implement the change, both for their own sustainability as growers and for the sake of the planet [
