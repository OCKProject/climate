<p class="p">The cranberry industry is of great social, historical and ecological significance to Massachusetts, being intimately tied to the development of the state since the days of the Pilgrims, associated with one of its most historic regions, Cape Cod, and valued by the community as an integral component of the Massachusetts landscape. Our study investigates the attitudes that cranberry growers in Massachusetts hold towards global climate change and its effects on their own livelihoods. In order to understand cranberry grower attitudes towards climate change, it is necessary to understand the broader social and ecological context in which cranberry growing is embedded. In this way, cranberries stand out as a unique agro-ecological system, one that makes neat divisions between agriculture and the surrounding landscape impossible to create. It is useful, then, to draw from theories in environmental sociology, a discipline that has long engaged with society-nature relations in efforts to discover how various social groups interact with their surroundings in socially, politically, economically, and ecologically entangled ways [
