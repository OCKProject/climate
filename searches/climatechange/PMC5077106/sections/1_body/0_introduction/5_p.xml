<p class="p">The main goal of this study was to determine the direct (through modifications of temperature and water availability) and indirect (through modifications of the interaction between the plant and its associated fungal endophytes) effects on the performance of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>. We specifically addressed the following questions: (1) Do abiotic factors (temperature and water) differentially affect the photochemical performance of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>?, and (2) Will GCC indirectly affect 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> photochemical performance and biomass accumulation by modifying its association with fungal endophytes? We predicted that: (i) GCC will have positive direct effects on the photochemical performance and fitness of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> and (ii) GCC will indirectly reduce the importance of the symbiotic interaction, without affecting to 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>.
