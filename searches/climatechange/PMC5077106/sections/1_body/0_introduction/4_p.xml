<p class="p">The two vascular plants (

 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> (Kunth) Barttl. (Caryophyllaceae), commonly known as the Antarctic pearlwort, is a small-sized cushion-like perennial herb, self-compatible in sexual reproduction, however vegetative reproduction is the more common means of propagation in this species in Antarctica [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. This species is characterized by an extremely wide distributional range spanning from Mexico (17°N) to the southern Antarctic Peninsula (69°S) [

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. This wide distribution has been attributed to the high levels of phenotypic plasticity and ecotypic differentiation in both morphological and physiological attributes [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Furthermore, since abiotic Antarctic environmental conditions are expected to become more benign for plant life due to GCC, a reduction in the positive net effects of microorganisms (e.g., root-fungal endophytes) on the physiological performance of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> can be predicted under a GCC scenario.
