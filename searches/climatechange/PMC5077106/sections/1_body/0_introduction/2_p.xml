<p class="p">Globally, a wealth of studies has addressed the impact of some of the component of global environmental change on vegetation [e.g.,

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], but there is a dearth of data on the impacts of multiple factors and in particular their interactions. Plant responses to multiple factors may be (1) additive, when there is no interaction between responses, (2) synergistic, when the outcome is greater than the additive impacts of the individual component, and (3) antagonistic, when some effects counteract others. Experimental approaches that include multivariate interactions are thus appropriate and likely to generate ecologically relevant information.
