<p class="p">On the other hand, the environmental changes (biotic and abiotic) predicted for the Antarctic ecosystems for the next 100 years include the prediction that Antarctic ecosystems will become less isolated than they are at present [

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Since the projected biotic and abiotic environmental changes will affect both the native and introduced components of the Antarctic flora, future studies should also address the interactions between native and alien plants in the context of change, in order to help predict how the terrestrial Antarctic landscape will change over coming decades.
