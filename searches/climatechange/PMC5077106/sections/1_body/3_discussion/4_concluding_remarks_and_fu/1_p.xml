<p class="p">Nearly 15 year ago, Alberdi et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>] studied the ecophysiological mechanisms deployed by the only two native vascular plants -
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">antarctica</italic>- to cope with the antarctic environment. Some of these mechanisms were related to high freezing resistance and high photosynthetic capacity at low temperature. Recently, Cavieres et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]) reviewed the mechanisms and adaptations deployed by antarctic vascular plants. Although both studies highlight the physiological capacity of these vascular plants to cope with environment, none of them assessed the effects of the future climate change (including biological interactions) on the photochemical performance and/or fitness of Antarctic plants. Thus, our study helps to fill a gap in the current literature of the ecophysiology of vascular Antarctic flora, since we show how biotic and abiotic factors modify the responses of 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>, driving its capacity to adapt and survive in that environment. In this context, this study provides valuable experimental evidence showing how Antarctic vascular plants (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>) will expand its regional distribution in Antarctica in future decades.
