<p class="p">It is important to acknowledge the limitations of our experimental design. Natural environmental conditions are virtually impossible to reproduce in growth chambers. Hence, our estimations of plant performance might differ from those we would find in the field, either because other biotic and/or abiotic variables were not measured. Thus natural conditions were not fully mimicked in our experimental setup and further field research is needed under field conditions.</p>
