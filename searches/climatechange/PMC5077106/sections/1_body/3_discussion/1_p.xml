<p class="p">Our results indicate that experimentally simulated GCC has profound effects on the photochemical performance and fitness-related traits of 
 <italic class="italic">Colobanthus quitensis</italic>, both through the consequences of direct modifications of abiotic conditions and the indirect modification of biotic interactions with endophytic fungi. Based on those results, shifts range after local scale population expansions in response to global change can be projected for 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> for the next decades. These findings are key to understand how Antarctic plant communities will respond to future climatic conditions.
