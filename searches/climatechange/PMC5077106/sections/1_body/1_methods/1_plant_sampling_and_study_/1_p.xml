 <italic class="italic">Colobanthus quitensis</italic> were collected in two Antarctic sites: close to the Polish Antarctic Station “Henryk Arctowski”, King George Island, South Shetland Islands (62°09′ S), and Lagotellerie Island in the Antarctic Peninsula (65°53′ S). All plants (between 5 and 15 cm diameter) were collected during the 2011–2012 growing season. Each individual plant was excavated together with the soil around the roots (ca. 250 g) and kept well-watered in a plastic box under natural conditions of light and temperature for 1 h until the transplant experiment in situ or for its transportation to be used in growth chambers experiments at the Centro de Estudios Avanzados en Zonas Áridas (CEAZA), La Serena, Chile (29°54′ S). Plants transported to CEAZA were replicated by vegetative propagation in order to increase the biological material for manipulative experiments conducted in the growth chambers. Plants used in the experiments with controlled condition (CEAZA) were generated from an initial pool of plants collected in the field between 1 and 100 m from each other, in the hopes of obtain greater genetic variability. Although sexual reproduction in limited in
