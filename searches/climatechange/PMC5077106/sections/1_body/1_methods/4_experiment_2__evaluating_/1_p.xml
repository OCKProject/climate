<p class="p">A field experiment was performed during the 2011–2012 growing season in the vicinity of the Polish Antarctic Station, King George Island in order to evaluate if GCC can indirectly effect 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> fitness-related traits through modifying the biotic interaction between 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> and its associated root-endophytic fungi. In this case, the ‘future’ scenario was simulated in a manipulation placed in the field through an increase in water availability (+W; 20% increase in water addition). A total of 60 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> individuals were assigned either to a water addition (+W) treatment (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30) or to a current moisture treatment (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30). Within each treatment, the 30 plants were randomly assigned to three further treatments: i) plants growing in pots filled with non-sterilized native soil (hereafter NS), ii) plants growing in pots filled with sterilized native soil (hereafter S-NS), and iii) plants growing in pots filled with sterilized native soil, re-inoculated with fungal endophytes (hereafter RI-SNS). Plants were grown in a sterilized mixture of rhizospheric soil (taken from the study site), perlite and sand (1:1:1), preventing initial contamination with other microorganisms. The inoculation procedure used a single strain of fungal endophyte isolated from 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic>, which was selected since its higher frequency in the host plant. This strain was previously identified as 
 <italic class="italic">Penicilluium chrysogenum</italic> using ITS and 28S sequencing [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] (Genbank code: KJ881371). The endophyte was cultured on PDA medium diluted by a factor of ten, supplemented with 50–100 mg/ml of ampicillin, tetracycline, and streptomycin, and cultures were then grown at 22°C under a 12/12 h light/dark regime. After 5–14 days of growth, conidia were harvested from plates by adding 10 ml of sterile water and gently scraping off spores with a sterile glass slide. The final volume of spores was adjusted to 100 ml with sterile water, filtered through four layers of sterile cotton cheesecloth gauze, and spore concentration adjusted to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup>–10
 <sup class="sup">7</sup> spores/ml. Lastly, plants were inoculated and grown under growth chamber conditions described above previous transplant in field in the vicinity of Arctowski station, King George island. The inoculation was repeated three times to ensure fungal association, and verification of an effective symbiosis was evidenced by microscopy. On the other hand, to obtain endophyte-free plants from clonal material, the commercially available fungicide “Benlate” (DuPont, Wilmington, DE, USA) were used. Benlate was chosen as no phytotoxic effects have been detected on perennial ryegrass [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Leaves and roots were completely submersed in tap water containing 2 gl
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup> of Benlate and maintained for 1 h at room temperature. After 4–5 weeks of growth, newly emerged tillers were examined for the presence of fungal infection. Assessing endophyte colonization was performed on a subset of at least 10% of total plants. Before the beginning of the experiment, two plants per treatments were sacrificed to check microscopically for the presence and/or absence of endophytes by routine staining. Three response variables were measured in 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> plants assigned to the three experimental treatments: photochemical performance (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">v</sub>/
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">m</sub>), total biomass and adult survivorship. The first two response variables were measured as described above. The survival of transplanted plants in the field was recorded every week over one month of experimental period.
