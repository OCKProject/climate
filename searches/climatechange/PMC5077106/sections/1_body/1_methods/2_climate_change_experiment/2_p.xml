<p class="p">Two growing chambers (Forma Scientific, Inc) were used for these experiments, one set at 4°C (“current climatic conditions treatment”) and other at 7°C (“warming treatment”; hereafter +T°). Both chambers were operated with a photosynthetically active photon flux density (PPFD) of 150 μmol m-2 s-1 and an 18/6 h light/dark period. The light source was provided by F40CW cool-white fluorescent tubes (General Electric). Since the effects of a treatment can be affected by the characteristics of the growth chamber (see [

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]), different treatments were conducted in both chambers and individuals were transferred between chambers, changing the settings in the abiotic conditions. Plants were maintained in plastic pots (300 cc) filled with native soil (soil around plants obtained from every site). Plastic pots positions were randomized within the growth chambers every week. At the end of each month, the chambers were switched off, cleaned, and individuals were transferred between chambers, and growth conditions were re-established [
