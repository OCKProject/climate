<p class="p">We evaluated the effect of GCC on 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> performance by measuring three response variables that are positively correlated with overall fitness. First, we estimated photochemical performance of PSII as the maximum quantum yield of PSII (Fv/Fm; where Fv = [Fm–F0], Fm = maximum fluorescence yield, and F0 = minimum fluorescence yield) using a pulse modulated-amplitude fluorimeter (FMS 2, Hansatech, Instrument Ltd, and Norfolk, UK). The measure Fv/Fm has been correlated with plant fitness and is a very good approach to the state of health of the photosynthetic system of a plant [
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. A group of leaves from each individual was dark-adapted for 30 min (to obtain open PSII centers) using a black-box (30 x 20 x 15 cm) to ensure maximum photochemical efficiency. Second, the direct effects of GCC on

 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> were evaluated in terms of the mean total biomass. After the end of the experiments, whole plants were harvested (root plus shoot), oven-dried for 48 h at 70°C and individually weighed using a digital balance. The third fitness-related variable was the percentage of plants generating flowering structures. This was documented before the end of the experiments (after 4 months of growth).
