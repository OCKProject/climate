 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> population located in the vicinity of the Polish Antarctic Station, South Shetland Islands (62°39`S 60°36`W). At this site, soil matrix potential was measured 10 cm from each of 12 randomly chosen individuals using a tensiometer Jet Fill 2725 Series (Soil Moisture, Co, USA). Measurements were conducted in two consecutive growing seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10). Tensiometers were buried 20 cm deep and matrix potential was recorded after a 30 min stabilization period. All measurements were made between 12:00 and 14:00 h, on four consecutive days and the data merged. As both growing seasons showed similar water availability results the two sets of data were merged (data not shown). Given that most climate models have predicted increases of water availability of 15–20% [

 <xref rid="pone.0164844.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>], we used an increase of 20% in water availability for the future conditions experiments. To achieve field-measured values (-24 kPa) under experimental conditions, plants were irrigated every 5 d with 70 ml of water. Thus, the +W treatment consisted in irrigating plants every 5 d with 84 ml of water.
