<p class="p">We evaluated the effects of watering and warming on 
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">quitensis</italic> fitness-related traits in two sites: King George Island and Antarctic Peninsula. A total of 48 plants per population were assigned to four treatments: warming (+T°, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12), watering (+W, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12), combined warming and watering (+T° +W, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12) and current environmental conditions (control: normal levels of water and temperature, 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12). This experiment was performed in growth chambers and lasted 16 weeks to simulate the natural duration of the growing season. We measured three fitness-related traits as response variables: photochemical performance, total plant biomass, and reproductive effort (measured as flowering percentage). As describe above, all individuals were re-arranged every week to minimize any chamber-specific effects.
