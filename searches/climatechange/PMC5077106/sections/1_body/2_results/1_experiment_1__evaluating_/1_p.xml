<p class="p">The factorial ANOVA revealed that site did not affect photochemical efficiency and biomass (
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). There was a significant interaction between site and treatments for photochemical efficiency (
 <xref rid="pone.0164844.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the simulated climatic conditions will have differential effects on different sites. Plants from King George Island exposed to simulated warming showed a significant increase in photochemical performance (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1C</xref>). Similarly, the +W treatment increased the photochemical performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>) and biomass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>) with respect to control plants. The effect of the combined +T°+W treatment on photochemical performance was significantly greater than that of the +T° treatment alone, but similar to that of the +W treatment, suggesting that +W has stronger effects than +T° (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). Plants from the Antarctic Peninsula also increased their photochemical performance (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1E</xref>) and percentage of plants flowering (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1F</xref>) in response to +T° and +W. As with King George Island plants, the interaction treatment (+T°+W) had stronger effects on photochemical performance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1D</xref>), biomass (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0164844.g001" class="xref">Fig 1E</xref>) and percentage of plants flowering (
