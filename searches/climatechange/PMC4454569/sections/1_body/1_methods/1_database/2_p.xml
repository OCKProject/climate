<p class="p">The DBR (23°10′N, 112°35′E) has a monsoon climate and is located in a subtropical, moist forest life zone. The annual mean temperature is 22.3°C and the annual mean rainfall is 1678 mm with a distinct seasonal pattern. Monthly average air temperature and precipitation, representing DBR's climatic regime, were obtained from the Gaoyao weather station [

 <italic class="italic">Pinus-Castanopsis-Schima</italic> community, which was at a relatively early stage of succession. There were very few human activities in the study area until 1980s and there was no big pest outbreak before 1985[
