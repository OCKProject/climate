As different species respond to climate change in various ways, species previously regarded as aliens will begin to appear in new communities. Species that can quickly adapt to new environmental conditions will outpace those that cannot [

However, in a relatively short time period of 20 to 30 decades, species composition will not change significantly. Although climate changes influence population growth of each species, these changes will not fundamentally affect community change rate within a few decades.
