<p class="p">The community composition change rate, Slnλ, is determined by population growth rates of all species in a community. Accordingly, it can be inferred that at the stages when vast species replacement takes place, Slnλ should be very high. This new index can be very useful when we want to compare the stability of different communities during a time period or different stages of community changing process.</p>
