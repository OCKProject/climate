<p class="p">Population growth rate is the unifying variable linking the various facets of population ecology. It is the summary parameter of trends in population density or abundance [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. For 3 species in DBR and 77 species in BCI, the population growth rate, ln位, is negatively correlated with time for most species. This is consistent with previous studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. However, these studies could not determine the underlying causes of a declining population growth rate over time [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], or attributed this decline to environmental factors such as rainfall patterns [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and survival variation [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. The present study, however, indicates that this decreasing trend of population growth rate may be mainly a consequence of community development. When we use the exponential growth model, logistic growth model and Gaussian curve to simulate population growth, the population growth rate, ln位, decreased over time except in the exponential growth model, where ln位 is constant (
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.g007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 7</xref>). In addition, our multiple regression analysis showed that ln位 was negatively correlated with time for the majority of species (
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.g004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>). It can be concluded that for most species in a community, a decreasing population growth rate is inevitable. This is because the plant abundance and species richness will be close to the maximum environment carrying capacity with increasing population density and plant size. In the present study, community I in DBR was a mature forest; community II was in an earlier stage of succession than community I. The BCI forest was mature and relatively stable throughout the study period [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. In addition to species-specific properties, the stage of population development is important in determining how the population growth rate of one species will respond to climatic factors.
