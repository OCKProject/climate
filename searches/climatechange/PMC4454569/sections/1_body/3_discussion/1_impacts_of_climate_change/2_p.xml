<p class="p">However, previous studies usually measured the population growth rate by focusing on one time period and neglected to study the development of a population. Such neglect may affect predicted results because population growth rates change, and usually decrease, over time. Recently, using a specific database extracted from collected literature, a synthesis study examined how population growth rates varied within and among 50 plant species [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. They found that population growth rates could vary greatly from species to species even within the same genus. However, population growth rates of different populations within the same species were similar, particularly if geographic distances among the populations were small and environmental factors were similar. These results can be explained by the present study, which demonstrates that the population growth rate of one species is not constant and is likely determined by the stage of community development and population growth. Different species usually appear at different stages of community development and have their own individual population growth parameters, even if they belong to the same genus [
 <xref rid="pone.0126228.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>]. Consequently, population growth rates vary greatly when species from different communities of different development stages are compared. Alternatively, nearby populations of the same species always belong to similar communities of nearly the same development stage. Therefore, populations with similar population growth rates may be geographically closer to each other.
