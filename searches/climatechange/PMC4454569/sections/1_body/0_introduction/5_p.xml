<p class="p">Herein, we aimed first to compose a method for calculating the community composition change rate and to examine the influence of climate factors on community composition change using two long-term forest datasets (the observation data from DBR and BCI). Second, we aimed to conduct a linear model to separate the impacts of climate factors and time factors on species-specific population growth rate and to testify the impacts of relatively faster climate change on community composition change rate within a relatively short period (several decades).</p>
