 <xref rid="pone.0126228.g001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). The rate of increasing temperature in BCI was greater than that in DBR. When we compared the trend of annual average temperature at the two sites across a similar period (1981–2005), we found that the annual average temperature of both DBR and BCI showed a similar upward trend.
