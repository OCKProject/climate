<p id="Par4" class="p">The USA-NPN repository includes a total of 39428 phenological status measurements for 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic>. 7158 of those status measurements are “yes” measurements indicating the presence of one phenophases: initial growth, flowering, or fruit ripening from 220 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> plants between the years 2011 and 2016. For this analysis, I only utilized the 1377 “yes” measurements that followed “no” measurements within a given year and were within the latitude range for plants observed in 2011. The dataset includes plants from 23 states and latitude and longitude ranges of 34.75° N–48.05° N and 68.70° W–98.4° W, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In the 23 states, maximum growing season temperature is significantly greater during the study period (2011–2016 mean = 19.17 °C ± 1.04) than historically (1895–2010 mean = 18.38 °C ± 0.68,

 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">4.7</italic>
 </sub> = 1.837, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.048). Growing season precipitation during the study period is not different from historical values. None of the three phenophases correlated with growing season precipitation through time, and neither initial growth nor fruit ripening changed with maximum growing season temperature. However, mean flowering date decreased with temperature (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −3.93, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">395</sub> = −2.5 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.011; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and that relationship increased from 2011 through 2016, as indicated by the significant, negative temperature by year interaction term (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −0.748, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">387</sub> = −2.261 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.024; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This relationship appears to be driven by a shift in the entire flowering period because both the end (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −4.44, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">381</sub> = −2.8, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.006; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) and beginning of flowering occur earlier as temperature increases (
 <italic class="italic">β</italic> = −3.77, 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>
 <sub class="sub">28</sub> = −2.48 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.013; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). There was no relationship between flowering and either initial growth or fruit ripening (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.06, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> = 0.69 and 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = −0.21,
