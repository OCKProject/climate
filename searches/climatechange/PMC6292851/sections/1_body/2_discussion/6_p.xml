<p id="Par10" class="p">One potential drawback of using citizen scientist data that is important to this analysis is a potential lack of precision and continuity of data collection. For example, individual citizens may not observe plants throughout a growing season or even from start to finish of an individual phenophase. This could lead to significant bias in these data and my interpretation of them. I attempted to mitigate this bias of incomplete sampling by only using “yes” status measurements for a phenophase within a given year that were preceded by “no” measurements. In addition, using these more complete sets of measurements may also indicate that they were collected by citizen scientist that are more engaged and invested in the goals of USA-NPN and, therefore, collect more precise data.</p>
