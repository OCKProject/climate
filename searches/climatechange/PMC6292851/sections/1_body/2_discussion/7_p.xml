<p id="Par11" class="p">Lack of precision in data collection could result in biased outcomes such as the observed absence of correlations between initial growth, fruit ripening, and flowering time. However, if there were a systematic bias in the dataset, then there would less likely be a significant statistical relationship between temperature and flowering time. Also, there are many biological factors that may lead to a lack of correlation between these phenophases. First, there is some evidence that there is variation in the response of growing season length to climate change by latitude. Lower latitudes (32° N–37° N) in North America appear to not have an increase in growing season to the same extent as higher latitudes (42° N–45° N)

 </sup>, which could add variance to phenophases, especially on the extremes of life history, such as initial growth and fruit production. Second, initial growth of 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> is influenced by photoperiod

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>
 </sup> in addition to temperature, meaning spring response by 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> to increased temperature could be mitigated or at least complicated by physiological responses cued by day length. This could also explain why we found no significant relationship between temperature and initial growth, which could then explain the decoupling of initial growth and flowering. In other words, different environmental factors could be differentially influencing the various phenophases. Third, if phenological mismatches do occur between 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> and their pollinators, they could influence fruit production, as well. For example, there is evidence that a majority of fruit in a closely related species (
 <italic class="italic">Asclepias speciosa</italic>) are produced on inflorescences that arise early in the flowering season

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup>. If this is also occurring in 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> and pollinators are not visiting flowers that are blooming earlier than expected as a result of climate change, then they will not be pollinated, and they will not produce fruit earlier than expected in the fall. Further work must be done to explain the complex interaction of all these factors on the correlation, or lack thereof, between phenophases.
