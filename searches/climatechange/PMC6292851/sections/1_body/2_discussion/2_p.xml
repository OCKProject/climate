<p id="Par6" class="p">The shift in the mean, minimum, and maximum flowering dates indicate that temperature is likely influencing when 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> is producing flowers, and not some other aspect of flowering phenology such as flower longevity. The correlation between temperature and maximum flowering date is larger than the correlation between temperature and minimum flowering date, but not significantly so (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). However, given more sampling or nuanced analyses this difference may become significant because many studies have found that increasing temperature significantly decreases the amount of time that flowers persist

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. In other words, temperature may not influence just when 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> begins producing flowers, but how long the flowers bloom. The flowers on 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> form as a series of umbellate cymes (inflorescences) that bloom chronologically along stems in a basal to apical manner

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>. If each cyme’s longevity is reduced, then the collective duration of flowering across the season could also be condensed, explaining why maximum (last) flowering dates occur relatively earlier, though not significantly so, than minimum (first) dates.
