<p id="Par8" class="p">An important but difficult question to ask, given the results of this study, is whether observed changes in phenology are the result of evolutionary responses or phenotypic plasticity

 </sup>. The changes in 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> flowering during this short period of time mirror the temperature patterns across the US indicating that they are the result of plasticity and not a genetic response. However, given the relatively long term increase in temperature and the forecasting of a continued increase in the foreseeable future
