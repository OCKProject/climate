<p id="Par5" class="p">During a 6 year time period (2011–2016) 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic>’s mean flowering dates have shifted with temperature, where with each degree of temperature increase the mean flowering date has decreased by 3.93 days (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). More importantly, temperatures in the 2011–2016 time span are significantly higher than they were historically, and flowering date is likely occurring earlier in response to temperature during that time period (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). These results indicate that this plant may be responding as predicted to global warming. Flowering did not correlate with initial growth or fruit ripening at the individual plant level, suggesting that temperature may be directly influencing flowering date. Moreover, the change in flowering seems to be driven by a shift in the entire flowering period because mean, maximum (last), and minimum (first) flowering dates are occurring earlier as temperatures increase (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
