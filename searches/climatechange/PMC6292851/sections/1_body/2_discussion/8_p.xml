<p id="Par12" class="p">This study is a first step toward understanding the influence of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> phenology. My results indicate that flowering times have significantly shifted toward earlier in the year as temperatures have increased and this pattern has become more significant from 2011 to 2016. Future work should explore potential relationships between climate change and 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic>-pollinator interactions with an emphasis on the conservation of this plant, especially in light of its recent decline in many areas
