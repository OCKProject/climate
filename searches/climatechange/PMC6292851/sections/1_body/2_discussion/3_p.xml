<p id="Par7" class="p">Changes in flowering time may negatively influence 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic>â€™s reproduction by disrupting the match between the timing of its flowering and its pollinators flight seasons. I am not aware of any studies that have investigated the influence of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> flowering time or its interactions with pollinators, but there are many recently documented plant-pollinator phenological mismatches

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>
 </sup>, indicating it could be an issue for this species. The negative consequences of a phenological mismatch for 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> could be significant, especially in pollen limited populations, because of its derived pollinium-pollination system that requires vectors for pollen dispersal

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>
 </sup>. However, it is also possible mismatches will not occur because the 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> flowering times and pollinator flight seasons could change in kind with increasing temperatures, as has been observed with other plant-pollinator interactions
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup>. Also, given that 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> is pollinated by a wide array of insects including many native bees, lepidopterans (moths and butterflies), and the non-native 
 <italic class="italic">Apis Mellifera</italic> (Western Honey Bee), if mismatches do occur with some pollinator species others may carry out the required pollen movement and minimize the negative consequences of mismatches
