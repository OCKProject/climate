<p id="Par15" class="p">I used repeated measures linear regressions to quantify the relationships between mean Julian flowering date of individual plants and mean growing season (March through November) maximum temperature and precipitation, and year. I also included year and temperature and year and precipitation interaction terms to determine if the relationship between flowering and climate is changing through the 6 year time period. I used mean instead of first date values, which are common measures in climate change studies, because first date is an incomplete and extreme measure of a phenophase distribution

 </sup>. However, to further examine the flowering phenophase, I generated models using minimum (first) and maximum (last) flowering dates. The repeated measures portion of the linear regressions controlled for repeated sampling of individual plants during multiple years. The latitudinal range of samples increased significantly from 2011 through 2016. Therefore, I only included samples that fell within the 2011 latitude range. In addition to limiting the latitude range, I also included it in my model along with elevation. All dependent variables, except for the temperature comparison between historical (1895–2010) and contemporary (2011–2016) dates, met the assumptions of parametric analyses. A parametric test is not appropriate for the historical to contemporary temperatures comparison because of the very different sample sizes of the historical versus contemporary data. Therefore, I used a Welch’s t-test. All statistical analyses were carried out using the R Statistical Program
