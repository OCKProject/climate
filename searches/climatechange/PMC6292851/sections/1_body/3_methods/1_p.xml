USA-NPN organizes and shares phenological data collected by scientists, citizen scientists, government organizations, non-government organizations, educators, and students that researchers can use to better understand and quantify the biological consequences of climate change. I downloaded all data for 
 <italic class="italic">A. syriaca</italic> from the repository for the years 2011 through 2016. I only included “yes” status phenological measurements in our analysis, which indicate the presence of the phenophase, such as flowering. More importantly, I only included “yes” status measurements that were preceded by “no” measurements within a given year to reduce the bias of incomplete surveying that may occur with data collected by citizen scientists. The climate data, daily maximum temperature and precipitation values, for the location of each plant in the USA-NPN repository was provided by DAYMET (

Also, I downloaded monthly state level maximum temperature and precipitation data from the NOAA website
