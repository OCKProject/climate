<p id="Par14" class="p">Using these datasets, I quantified the linear relationship between climate (temperature and precipitation) and Julian flowering date for the six-year period, 2011–2016. However, the response of flowering to climate change does not occur in a vacuum. For example, other aspects of plant phenology may also respond to climate change in concert with or opposition to flowering time

 </sup>. This variability in response may be due to the wide array of environmental factors, in addition to temperature and precipitation, which are influenced by climate change and in turn influence many phenological stages, such as germination, vertical growth, and leafing

 </sup>. It is critical to examine many aspects of phenology when quantifying the influence of climate change on a plant’s flowering period. Therefore, to determine if there was any potential influence of the timing of other phenophases on flowering I quantified the linear correlations between flowering and both initial growth and fruit ripening for individual plants within each year. I used initial growth and fruit ripening because they provide full coverage of the annual growth cycle of
