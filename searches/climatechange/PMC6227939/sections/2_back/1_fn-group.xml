  <p class="p">The taxonomy of the family Naticidae from the La Meseta Formation is not yet fully resolved (see [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>, appendix S2, p. 24]). The two most-abundant species in the LMF were designated as 
   <italic class="italic">Polinices</italic> cf. 
   <italic class="italic">subtenius</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">P. marambioensis</italic> by Stillwell and Zinsmeister [

   <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], in their recent, comprehensive overview of the molluscan fauna of the LMF, including much of the material treated in this study and additional collections housed at the British Antarctic Survey, concluded that these species should be assigned to the genus 
   <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> (
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181446F1" class="xref">figure 1</xref>

   <xref rid="RSOS181446C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>, p. 216], which is commonly found in Antarctic waters today [

   <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] further stated that 
   <italic class="italic">P. marambioensis</italic> is highly unlikely to be a distinct species from 
   <italic class="italic">P.</italic> cf. 
   <italic class="italic">subtenuis</italic>. Two other naticid taxa, 
   <italic class="italic">Eunaticina infrequens</italic> and 
   <italic class="italic">Sinuber powelli</italic>, were described by Stillwell and Zinsmeister [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]; however, only a single individual of each of these rare species was identified in the material we examined for this study. Thus, we are confident that the predatory drillholes we found on the shells of 
   <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> n. sp. were made by conspecific cannibals.

  <p class="p">The possibility that a lack of alternative prey may influence the frequency of cannibalism was recently raised by Brezina 
   <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] for 
   <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> n. sp. (identified by the authors as 
   <italic class="italic">P. marambionensis</italic>) from the upper part of the 
   <italic class="italic">Cucullaea</italic> I Allomember (=Telm 5 in this study) of the LMF. They found cannibalism attack frequencies that were approximately 2−3 times greater than those reported in this study and speculated that ‘the low relative abundance of other possible prey … could have affected … naticid behaviour’ [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, p. 213]. However, the Brezina 
   <italic class="italic">et al.</italic> [
   <xref rid="RSOS181446C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] samples—unlike those used in this study—came from a tidal channel deposit composed of ‘densely packed shell concentrations’, which were dominated by specimens of 
   <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> n. sp., with low abundances of other taxa.
