<p class="p">To test our prediction that cannibalism should decline after the cooling event, complete and incomplete naticid drillholes in each sample of 
 <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> were identified and counted. The frequency of cannibalism—defined as the proportion of prey that were attacked—was calculated as the number of specimens with drillholes (complete and incomplete) divided by the total number of specimens in the sample [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C9" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. We tested for differences in the frequency of cannibalism between BC and AC samples using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test. Because larger naticids are more likely than smaller naticids to be cannibals [

 <xref rid="RSOS181446C8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>], we compared the mean body size of all drilled and undrilled specimens in the AC versus BC samples. We used a 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>-test to assess whether the estimates of cannibalism could have been biased by an overall shift in the mean body size structure of the naticid population.
