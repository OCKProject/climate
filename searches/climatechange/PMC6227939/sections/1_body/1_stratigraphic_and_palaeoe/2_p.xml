<p class="p">The LMF on Seymour Island, Antarctica (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="RSOS181446F2" class="xref">figure 2</xref>) is one of the most complete Eocene records in the world. The sedimentary succession consists of about 720 m of sandstones and mudstones interbedded with shell-rich, pebbly conglomerates [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. The LMF is stratigraphically well-constrained and has been divided into seven lithofacies units: Telms 1–7 [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. The sedimentary record is nearly complete except for one unconformity at the base of Telm 6 (e.g. [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]). The fossil assemblage of the LMF represents a shallow-water marine fauna inhabiting intertidal to subtidal environments. A significant facies shift occurs between Telms 5 and 6, indicating more freshwater influence in Telm 6 [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Stable oxygen isotope data from two benthic bivalves (
 <italic class="italic">Cucullaea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Eurhomalea</italic>) commonly found in the LMF are suggestive of about 10°C of cooling from the early Eocene climatic optimum (approx. 15°C; Telm 3) through the end of the Eocene (minimum approximately 5°C; Telm 7) [
