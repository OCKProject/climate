 <xref rid="RSOS181446C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Predicting exactly how ecological interactions will be altered is challenging because the physiological responses to temperature change (e.g. shifts in metabolic rate, growth, activity, etc.) often vary widely among species [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. Models of the thermal responses of consumer–resource interactions suggest that if predator and prey possess traits that have asymmetric responses to temperature, such as metabolic rate and body velocity (e.g. how fast a predator moves when foraging for its prey), then changes in interaction dynamics are likely to arise [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. Although variation in species' thermal responses complicates predictions for many interspecific interactions, predicting the responses of intraspecific interactions such as cannibalism may be less problematic, because the consumer and the ‘resource’ possess traits that respond more or less identically to temperature. In such cases, the dynamics are predicted to unfold in the same qualitative manner but at an accelerated or decelerated pace, depending on whether the temperature was increased or decreased, respectively [
