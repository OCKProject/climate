<p class="p">The temporal pattern of incomplete drilling initially does not appear to support this interpretation. All else being equal, failed cannibalistic attacks should have been more common before the climate cooled, when the potential interruptions of the time-intensive drilling process [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] by shell-crushing predators were more common. The proportion of cannibalistic attacks that were unsuccessful, however, increased slightly, albeit not significantly, after the climate cooled (
 <xref rid="RSOS181446TB1" ref-type="table" class="xref">table 1</xref>). The tendency for defensive traits, such as escape body velocity, to be under stronger selection pressure to maintain nearly optimal performance across a range of temperatures than are traits related to consumption, such as attack body velocity, may help explain this counterintuitive result [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In general, for ectothermic animals, ‘escapes and failed attacks may be more common at low temperatures because escape body velocity typically remains close to peak levels and is thus higher than attack body velocity’ [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>, p. 81]. This difference in activation energies implies that the defensive traits of naticids should have been less sensitive to cooling temperature changes than traits related to foraging.
