 <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic>, our results show that cannibalistic drilling frequencies did not decrease with climatic cooling in the LMF. The lack of decline in cannibalism could be linked to the overall shift in the composition and structure of the Antarctic benthos that also occurred as the Eocene climate cooled. By the end of the Eocene, the predatory activities of decapod crustaceans, teleostean fishes and neoselachian sharks were substantially reduced [
