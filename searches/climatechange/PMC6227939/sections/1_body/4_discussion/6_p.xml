<p class="p">Nor does a lack of alternative prey seem likely to explain the cannibalism patterns. If prey resources were scarce and/or spatially or temporally restricted, naticids would be forced to cannibalize each other. The post-cooling benthic community of Telm 7, however, includes abundant bivalves (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Saxolucina</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Eurhomalea</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Mya</italic>) and gastropods (e.g. 
 <italic class="italic">Chlanidota</italic>; formerly 
 <italic class="italic">Sudonassarius</italic>; [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]) that were well within the size range vulnerable to naticids, suggesting that cannibalism was not a last resort for naticids foraging in a low-food environment.

 </sup> Indeed, if our risk hypothesis is correct, drilling predation on other prey taxa should also not decline in the LMF after the cooling event. Consistent with this prediction, Aronson 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] showed that declining temperatures did not alter the frequency of drilling predation by naticids on 
 <italic class="italic">Eurhomalea,</italic> the most abundant genus of infaunal bivalves in the LMF (0.06 BC and 0.06 AC).
