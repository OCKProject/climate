<p class="p">Finally, and more broadly, our data highlight that models of the species-level responses to recent climate change may be misleading if they only consider the direct effects of temperature on physiology. The indirect effects of strong consumerâ€“resource interactions potentially play a large role. For such interactions, the indirect effects of climate change will probably be significant drivers of the structure and function of marine-benthic communities, as they appear to have been for naticid cannibals in Antarctica's distant past.</p>
