<p class="p">An alternative hypothesis to explain the unexpected patterns of cannibalism is that 
 <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> were more abundant than other prey resources after the cooling event. We cannot test this idea directly, but research on naticid cannibalism in other systems suggests that fluctuations in naticid abundance and cannibalistic drilling rarely exhibit a positive correlation [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Thus, it is unlikely that the stable frequencies of cannibalism we observed are a simple consequence of increased 
 <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> abundance after the climate cooled.
