<p class="p">Populations of naticids might have benefited directly from the reduced predation pressure that accompanied climatic cooling. Ecological experiments have shown that increases in temperature may strengthen indirect species interactions in food webs. For instance, Miller

 <italic class="italic">Falsilunatia</italic> are consistent with this idea, though in reverse: the disappearance of shell-crushing predators as the Eocene climate cooled may have relaxed shell-crushing predation pressure (i.e. top-down control) on naticids, making their environment less risky. The absence of predation pressure from shell-crushing predators may have subsequently stimulated naticid foraging, increasing cannibalism despite a reduced capacity for activity and metabolic scope at lower temperatures (as is the case today for other Antarctic marine invertebrates adapted to life in the cold [
 <xref rid="RSOS181446C13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]). This indirect effect of the reduced role of shell-crushing predators probably offset the expected decrease in cannibalism in colder environments represented by the upper section of the LMF.
