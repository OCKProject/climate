<p class="p">Potential biases also must be ruled out before accepting our finding that cannibalism frequencies did not change with climatic cooling. Given that the predatory activities of shell-crushing predators were substantially reduced after the cooling event [

If successful predation by shell-crushing predators often destroyed prey shells and shell crushers were more important components of the benthic fauna BC, the cannibalism frequencies we estimated for Telms 2–5 might be exaggerated, possibly suggesting that cannibalism intensified after the climate cooled. However, Smith

 <xref rid="RSOS181446C31" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] have shown that when drilling frequencies are low (approx. 0.05, as is the case in the present study) the potential magnitude of such a bias—if it exists—is extremely low (only shifting the observed drilling frequency by a few percentage points) under low to moderate levels of shell loss from durophagous predation, boosting confidence in our interpretations.
