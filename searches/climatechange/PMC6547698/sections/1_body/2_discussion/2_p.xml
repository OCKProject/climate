<p id="Par22" class="p">Our analysis constrains the upper climate limit of all species assessed to the highest MAT across a study region (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>.
 <italic class="italic">e</italic>., 29.4 °C at a 5-arc minute resolution in our Australian example). This means that no species can have an observed climate limit higher, or lower, than the highest value of MAT or MAP recorded across Australia. Of the 20,608 species assessed here, 151 (0.7%) have upper observed climate limits for MAT occurring at this 29.4 °C threshold, and a further 1,147 species have upper limits within 1 °C of this threshold. These 151 species are important targets for physiological/experimental research, particularly those which are dominant and widespread such as 
 <italic class="italic">Eucalyptus tetrodonta</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">camaldulensis</italic>, to characterise their temperature tolerances and adaptive capacity under climate change. Increases in mortality in

 <italic class="italic">tetrodonta</italic> in the Victoria River regions of the Northern Territory have been attributed to drought-related die-back due to localised dry-season water stress
