<p id="Par23" class="p">Our approach to continental scale analysis of vegetation offers a biogeographic perspective on the exposure, safety margin, risk and potential adaptive capacity of the Australian flora. This analysis can identify regions and species of greatest concern for conservation planning (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>); or, areas with smaller safety margins for MAT and MAP under climate change than expected by chance (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3C</xref>). Similarly, data on observed climate limits can be used to identify species to target for physiological experimentation (e.g., the 151 species with observed climate limits at Australia’s highest MAT). Currently, detailed physiological experimentation to quantify the response of Australian vegetation to climate change is either highly site-based (
