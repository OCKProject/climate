<p id="Par27" class="p">Our analysis was limited to the use of estimates of the observed climate niche of species across their historical distribution, as opposed to using assessments of the highest MAT or lowest MAP under which plant function can be maintained (

 </sup>). We acknowledge that fundamental limits may not be bounded by conditions experienced across the range; species may not be physiologically intolerant of cooler or warmer, drier or wetter conditions not encountered across their historical distribution. That said, a recent meta-analysis of eleven reciprocal transplant experiments showed strong support for the idea that geographic range limits closely approximate niche limits

 </sup>. Our analysis captures which species have been recorded at least once at a location, though as herbarium collections accumulate over time current day composition may differ. Similarly, herbarium collections offer no accompanying data on species abundance and this may affect estimates of safety margins.
