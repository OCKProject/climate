  <p class="p">Risk to Australian vegetation from change in mean annual temperature (°C) and precipitation (mm) by 2070 under RCP8.5 (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>). Brown regions in A-B indicate regions where exposure to climate change (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">D</bold>) exceeds the safety margin (
   <bold class="bold">E</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">F</bold>) of vegetation based on current MAT and MAP patterns. Exposure is derived from the median projection from five global climate models (ACCESS1.0, CNRM-CM5, HADGEM2-CC, MIROC5, NorESM1-M) centred on the decade 2070 under RCP8.5. Safety margins are based on the difference between observed climate limits and long-term average climate conditions amongst species sharing a 100 km × 100 km grid-cell locations (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The average climate breadth of species in each location (
   <bold class="bold">G</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">H</bold>) approximates the adaptive capacity of vegetation to climate change (darker blue regions indicating greater adaptive capacity). In all maps, values are coded into five equally-sampled (quantile) bands.
