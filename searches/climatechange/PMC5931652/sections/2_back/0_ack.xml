 <p class="p">We thank all the stakeholders of the Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (AGEDI) Local, National, and Regional Climate Change (LNRCC) Programme for their feedback, and particularly Jane Galavan and William Dougherty for their inputs and advice. The LNRCC Programme was a stakeholder-driven initiative designed to build upon, expand, and deepen our understanding of the vulnerability to climate change impacts, as well as to identify practical adaptive responses at local (Abu Dhabi), national (UAE), and regional (Arabian Peninsula) levels. The authors acknowledge support from the AGEDI. WWLC, VL, GR and CCCW also acknowledge funding support from the Nippon Foundation University of British Columbia Nereus Program, a collaborative initiative by the Nippon Foundation and partners. WWLC acknowledges support from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; and VL funding support from the Wellcome Trust. DA, MK, MP, DP and DZ acknowledge the
