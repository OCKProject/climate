<p class="p">We evaluated the impacts of climate change based on modelled species-specific preferred ranges and drove projections using predicted shifts in temperature and salinity. For marine fishes and invertebrates, temperature is a primary climate stressor that affects their physiology, distribution and phenology [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. However, other factors, such as oxygen concentration, acidification, and changes in ocean circulation can moderate a species response to temperature under climate change [

 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref090" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">90</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref092" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref093" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">93</xref>]. Thus, our projections are considered to be conservative because we did not account for the potential additional or synergistic effects of changes in other ocean variables. Moreover, the models used are based only on a speciesâ€™ realised niche [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], with the projected distributions not taking into consideration other ecological dynamics and trophic interactions among species that are at play and that may alter our results.
