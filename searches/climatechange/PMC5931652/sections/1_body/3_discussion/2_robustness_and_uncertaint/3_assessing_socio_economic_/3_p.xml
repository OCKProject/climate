<p class="p">Generally, our results align well with a recent global vulnerability assessments of fisheries to climate change [

Beyond some differences in methodology that may explain some differences, it is important to also note that our analyses focused on the Gulf region only. Some countries with high vulnerability scores to climate change impacts (e.g., Oman, Saudi Arabia) may in reality be less exposed to climate change than results suggest based on catches obtained from, and climate change impacts on, another sea. Alternatively, given that previous studies project high impacts of climate change on fisheries in the Indian Ocean [

 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref096" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], the vulnerability scores estimated for the Gulf may be conservative.
