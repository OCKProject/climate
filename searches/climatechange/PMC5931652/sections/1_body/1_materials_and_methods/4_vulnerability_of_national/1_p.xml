<p class="p">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines ‘vulnerability’ as “the degree to which a system is susceptible to, and unable to cope with, adverse effects of climate change” [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref054" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">54</xref>]. Vulnerability assessments have been used in various disciplines to assess the susceptibility of natural or human systems to negative impacts as a result of human activities or natural pressures [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref055" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">55</xref>]. A vulnerability assessment of fisheries to climate change involves understanding the impacts of climate change on the biophysical and social components of marine ecosystems [

 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Here, we chose to assess the relative vulnerability of each country’s fisheries to climate change as a function of three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity [

 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Exposure is the nature and degree to which fisheries are exposed to climate change. Sensitivity usually refers to the degree to which national economies are dependent on fisheries and therefore sensitive to any changes in the sector. Adaptive capacity is the ability of a social system in the current context to anticipate, respond and adjust to changes from climate stresses, and to minimise, cope with, and recover from the consequences of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. Adaptive capacity includes elements of social capital, human capital, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of governance structures [
