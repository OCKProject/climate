<p class="p">The vulnerability of each country to impacts on its fisheries due to climate change was calculated by taking the unweighted average of the standardized indices for each dimension of vulnerability. We took the average, because no clear understanding of the interaction among these constituent components was available at the time analyses were undertaken. Components can be summed or multiplied, or a particular indicator within a dimension may be given more weight based on local evidence [

 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic> assumption about the importance of each dimension, or indicator within each dimension, in the overall sum to calculate the vulnerability of each country to climate change (i.e., V = f (E, S, AC). Thus, each of the indicators is viewed as having an equal contribution to a countryâ€™s overall vulnerability [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that vulnerability is robust to change in the weighting of its components and to different methods of calculations [
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0194537.ref086" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">86</xref>]. A country with a high vulnerability score is assumed to have a combination of: (i) high exposure to climate change; (ii) high level of fisheries contributions to its national economy and food security; and (iii) low ability to respond and adapt to the risks posed by climate change.
