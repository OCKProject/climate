<p class="p">In this study we focused on the following charismatic species: dugong (
 <italic class="italic">Dugong dugon</italic>), Indo-Pacific humped-back dolphin (
 <italic class="italic">Sousa chinensis</italic>), Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin (
 <italic class="italic">Tursiops aduncus</italic>), green turtle (
 <italic class="italic">Chelonia mydas</italic>), and hawksbill turtle (
 <italic class="italic">Eretmochelys imbricata</italic>). Current and future habitat suitability of these species in the Gulf were projected using the modelling methods as described above. Thus, it may not include the full range of environmental and ecological factors affecting the distribution of marine turtles and marine mammals. Also, we did not predict habitat suitability for specific life stages (e.g., foraging or nesting populations), which may be more or less sensitive to environmental changes. These methodological limitations should be taken into account when interpreting our results, and the projected future distributions of charismatic species should be considered only as an indicator of their relative vulnerability to climate change. Results are discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194537.s006" class="xref">S1 Appendix</xref> in the context of (a) habitat variables besides temperature and salinity that will be important in determining the populations of charismatic species’ future state under climate change; (b) where relevant, how different life history stages may be affected; (c) their migratory behavior; and (d) local stressors such as fisheries, shoreline development, dredging, and oil drilling, which are likely to represent more imminent and dangerous threats to these species’ survival than climate change.
