<p class="p">Our analyses also included looking at charismatic species individually (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194537.g005" class="xref">Fig 5</xref>). While models showed varying ranges of loss in habitat suitability for dugong, marine turtles, and Indo-Pacific dolphin, on the whole, future projections were largely inconclusive. For bottlenose dolphins, all three environmental niche models projected large declines in habitat suitability under climate change for most areas, with the exception of the northern region.
