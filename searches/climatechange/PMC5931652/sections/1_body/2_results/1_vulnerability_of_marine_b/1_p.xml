<p class="p">Meta-data for the 55 priority species, including habitat information, size, depth range and trophic level are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194537.s004" class="xref">S2 Table</xref>. The occurrence records (global) are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194537.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>. Occurrences for all of the species modelled have been recorded outside of the Gulf (i.e., the Gulf represents a subset of the overall habitat that these species inhabit). Therefore, in modelling their distribution, we used the global occurrence records to capture the full range of environmental preferences and tolerances of each species.
