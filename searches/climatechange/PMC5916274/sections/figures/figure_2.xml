  <p class="p">A schematic presentation of the experimental setup applied in our study. The control section is situated upstream of the drought and flooded sections with buffers in‚Äêbetween. Flooding was created by constructing dams (marked as bars on the figure) to obstruct the water flow in the main channels. (a) In Denmark, a lateral dam of sandbags was constructed across the stream channel. (b) In Germany and the Netherlands, longitudinal dams were built within the channel, which together with a lateral dam across the channel obstructed the water flow in the main channel. (c) The position of the sample transects within the experimental sections. The first piezometer was placed just above the summer water table (position 1), the second piezometer just above the normal winter water table (position 2) and the third at the high end of the floodplain (position 3). The circles indicate the position of the piezometers along each transect</p>
