<p class="p">There were large variations in species composition among the four study sites regarding both type considered (i.e., seed pool, bare plot, and existing vegetation), treatment applied (i.e., control, drought, and flooding), and time of sampling (i.e., 2011, 2012 and 2013; Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). The effects of the applied treatment on the compositional patterns in the experimental areas were significant for both the seed pool and the existing vegetation (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0004" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">4</xref>). Several of the traits used to describe the functional characteristics of the vegetation were associated with the main gradients in taxonomic composition (Tables 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0005" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0006" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">6</xref>), suggesting that they captured important underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed compositional changes.
