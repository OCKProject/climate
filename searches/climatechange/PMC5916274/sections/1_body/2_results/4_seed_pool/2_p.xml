<p class="p">As opposed to our third hypothesis, we did not find a significant increase in the taxonomic richness or diversity of the seed pool in response to flooding (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>; ANOVA; 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; .05), but we observed an increase in functional diversity but only for SM at position 2 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). Instead, we observed several changes in the trait value of the seed pool in response to flooding (CH, LM, LS at position 1; SM, LM, LS at position 2; BYC, SM, SV, CH, LM, LS at position 3) and drought (CH, LM, LS at position 1; CH, LS at position 2) and most of these changes followed the predicted pattern (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) particularly close to the stream.
