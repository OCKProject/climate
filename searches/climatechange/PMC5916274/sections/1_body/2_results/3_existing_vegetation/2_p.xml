<p class="p">Applying response ratios, we detected consistent changes among study sites for both the taxonomic and functional composition of the plant communities. In accordance with the first hypothesis, we observed that both species richness and Shannon diversity were negatively affected by drought and flooding and that the response varied with distance from the streams (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). At position 1, the richness and diversity of the existing vegetation declined in response to drought the first year after initiating the treatment (i.e., the response ratio was significantly lower than zero), and richness was still lower after 3 years of treatment (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Further away from the streams at position 2, we observed a decline in species richness and diversity, but the response was only significant after 3 years of flooding (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
