<p class="p">In accordance with the second hypothesis, we also identified consistent changes in the functional diversity of the existing vegetation in particular in response to flooding (Figures

 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>a). Close to the streams, at positions 1 and 2, we observed that the functional diversity of all traits declined in response to 3 years of flooding (BYC SM, SV, CH, LM, and LS; Figures

 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a), whereas the functional diversity of CH declined in response to 3 years to drought but only at position 1 (closest to the stream). Farthest away from the streams at position 3, we observed a decline in the functional diversity of two traits (LM and LS) in response to drought (Figure
