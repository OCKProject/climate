<p class="p">In accordance with the second hypothesis, we also observed consistent changes in the mean functional trait (CWM) values of the existing vegetation in response to the applied treatments and, as demonstrated by the diversity patterns, the response varied with distance from the streams (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b, 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b, and 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b) and generally followed the predicted patterns (see Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Close to the streams, at position 1, BYC‐CWM increased in response to flooding and SM‐CWM increased in response to drought (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b) but, in contrast to our expectations, SV‐CWM declined in response to flooding. Further away from the stream, at position 2, BYC‐CWM and CH‐CWM increased in response to flooding and LS‐CWM declined (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b), but in contrast to our expectations, LM‐CMW declined in response to drought (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>b). Farthest away from the stream at position 3, we observed an increase in SV‐CWM in response to flooding, also confirming our expectations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b), but SM‐CWM increased which was in contrast to our expectations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b). We also observed several significant changes in the trait composition of the community in response to drought at position 3 (BYC, SM, CH, LS, SV, LM) and for the majority of the traits, these changes were as predicted (BYC, SM, CH, LS; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>b).
