<p class="p">We observed large study site variability in plant community responses to the hydrological conditions of our experiment, regarding both drought and flooding. We did, however, identify consistent patterns in the taxonomic and functional responses of plant communities to the altered hydrological settings. Both taxonomic diversity and functional diversity were generally negatively affected by flooding and to some extent also by drought. These findings indicate that the range of successful strategies declined due to the altered hydrological settings. The loss in functional diversity was also reflected in the mean trait response of the riparian community but fewer significant and consistent changes appeared in response to the altered hydrological conditions. This might reflect a combination of the existence of several strategies within the vegetation to cope with the altered hydrological settings and a delay in the mean trait response due to a slow and progressive filling of available niches. Taken together, our results demonstrate that even though it is difficult within a 3‚Äêyear time frame to predict general effects of extreme hydrological conditions on riparian vegetation characteristics across large regions, the observed losses in diversity likely affect ecosystem functioning by reducing niche complementarity with possible cascading effects on resource use efficiency.</p>
