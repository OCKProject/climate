<p class="p">Vegetation surveys were conducted during the growing season (June–September). Percentage coverage was estimated for all vascular species in a total of 27 plots (50 × 50 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) per site for each treatment. These were positioned with three plots next to each of the three piezometers in each of the three transects. Species composition was recorded according to the Braun‐Blanquet method (
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1928</xref>), adjusted by Barkman, Doing, and Segal (
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1964</xref>). In the two Danish sites, an additional 27 bare plots were established with three plots next to each of the three piezometers in each of the three transects in order to follow the establishment of the vegetation under the new hydrological settings during the experimental period. These were created by removing the existing vegetation and the topsoil followed by deposition of 15 cm mixed sand and peat. To avoid ingrowth of nearby plants, the plots were delineated using 15‐cm‐wide plastic bands that were vertically inserted into the soil.
