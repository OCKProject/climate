 <sup class="sup">®</sup>) were placed and secured near the square plots used for vegetation surveys. Seeds were collected in 2011 in both control, flooded, and drought areas during the 6 weeks of experimental flooding and 10 weeks of experimental drought. The mats were removed from the field immediately after the experimental period and taken to the laboratory where they were stored in plastic bags in the dark at 4°C before processing. The processing involved extraction of deposited material by flushing the seed traps with water, followed by wet sieving the deposits to remove fine silt and clay. The material was then dried at 70°C for 48 hr after which intact seeds were visually identified from the dried material, manually removed, and determined to species level with the use of the “Digital seed atlas of the Netherlands” (Cappers, Bekker, &amp; Jans,
