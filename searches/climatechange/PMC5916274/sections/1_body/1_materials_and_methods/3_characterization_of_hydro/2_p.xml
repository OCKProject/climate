<p class="p">The water table depths were measured at least four times during the experimental periods in each experimental year (at the start of the experiment, after 2 weeks, after 4 weeks, and at the end of the experiment). Mean values of water table depths are given in Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>. Positive values indicate that flooding occurred; the more positive the values, the higher the flooding depths. Similarly, negative values indicate that the water table is situated below the surface, and the more negative the values, the deeper the water table. Close to the streams (position 1), the flooding treatment prolonged the duration of winter flooding and increased the depth of flooding, whereas the drought treatment generally lowered the groundwater table during the treatment period (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Further away from the stream at position 2, the flooding treatment resulted in occasional winter floodings during the treatment period, whereas the drought treatment lowered the groundwater table (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). Farthest away from the stream (position 3), the flooding treatment resulted in overall higher groundwater tables during the treatment period, whereas the drought treatment lowered the groundwater table (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>).
