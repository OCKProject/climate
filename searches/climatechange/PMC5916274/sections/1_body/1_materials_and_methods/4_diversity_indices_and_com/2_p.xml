 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). We calculated taxon richness and Shannon diversity as indices of taxonomic diversity. Traits were allocated to the encountered species based on information available in the LEDA database (Kleyer &amp; Bekker, 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and literature cited in Douma et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). We selected traits describing both seed (SM, BYC, SV; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>) and adult (SLA, LS, LM, CH, RP, RD; Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>) plant characteristics expected to respond to an altered hydrological regime as described in the introduction (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The number of species with trait information and the total abundances of these species are given in Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>. We calculated functional divergence (FDvar) and community‐weighted means (CWMs) when the abundance of species with trait information was above 65%, thereby precluding specific leaf area, root porosity, and rooting depth (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). The abundance limit represented a balance between on the one hand to have as many traits as possible integrated in the analyses to obtain insight into the functional response of the plant community to climate change‐related alterations in the hydrology of the areas, and on the other hand to keep the estimation bias low (Borgy et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). FDvar and CWMs were calculated for each trait according to Lavorel et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>).
