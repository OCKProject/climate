<p class="p">All analyses described in this paragraph were conducted using the statistical software R (R Core Team 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), package 
 <sc class="sc">vegan</sc> (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) (function 
 <italic class="italic">cca</italic>) followed by permutational ANOVAs (function 
 <italic class="italic">anova.cca</italic> with maximum permutations set to 9999) was performed to assess differences in plant community composition between treatments (control, drought, flooding), type of vegetation (seed, existing vegetation, bareplot), and year (2011, 2012, 2013). To estimate the unique effect of a single predictor (i.e., treatment, type of vegetation, and year), the variation in plant community composition explained by the other predictors was always partialled out (i.e., included as covariables) in the ANOVAs. We also assessed which traits were significantly associated with differences in plant community composition between treatments by fitting trait vectors (describing the relative abundance of traits in each plot; i.e., CWMs) onto the CCA ordination using the function 
 <italic class="italic">envfit</italic>. The 
 <italic class="italic">envfit</italic> function finds the direction in the ordination space toward which each trait vector changes most rapidly and to which it is maximally correlated with the ordination configuration. The significance of the trait vectors was determined by a permutation test (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 999).
