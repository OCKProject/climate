<p class="p">To assess the general effects of the treatments across the study streams, we combined the yearly estimates into a single effect size measurement and tested whether the response ratios (Δr) of taxonomic diversity, trait diversity, and CWMs differed significantly from zero (i.e., higher or lower than zero) using two‐sided 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> tests. The yearly response ratio estimates were combined by a weighted average using the variance for year as the weight. 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> tests were performed separately for each vegetation type (seed, existing vegetation, bareplot). A significant result was interpreted as a consistent and detectable change in the metric value in the control site versus the treated (flooded or dry) site across the investigated streams.
