<p class="p">Within each section, three sample transects were established perpendicular to the stream from the channel and upwards in the riparian areas (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The length of the sample transects varied among the study sites in order to represent a gradient from the lowest water table of the stream under summer base flow conditions to the highest point of the stream valley potentially flooded by surface water during extreme winter floods (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). To determine the hydrology of the control, drought, and flooded sections, a total of nine piezometers were installed within each section (three along each sample transect). The first piezometer was placed close to the stream, just above the normal summer water table in the stream, that is normally not flooded during summer but occasionally during winter floods (position 1; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). The second piezometer was placed just above the normal winter water table that is normally not flooded in either summer or winter (position 2; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). The third piezometer was placed at the highest point of the floodplain that was rarely flooded and, if so, only during extreme winter flooding events (once every 100 years; position 3; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c).
