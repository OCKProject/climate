<p class="p">Four riparian areas situated along streams in Denmark (Sandemandsbækken 56.158507 N, 9.496120 E; Voel Bæk 56.195846 N, 9.703932 E), Germany (Boye 51°58′61.1″N, 6°91′10.01″E), and the Netherlands (Groote Molenbeek 51°39′17.32″N, 6°03′59.47″E) were selected for the experiment (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The four streams varied in mean discharge from 0.03 to 1.73 m
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>/s. This was, however, not considered problematic as our sampling effort was focused on covering the natural features of the stream‐riparian gradient at the study sites irrespective of size. That is, the sampling covered a gradient from the water table of the stream under summer base flow conditions to the high end of the floodplain where only extreme events lead to flooding (Figure
