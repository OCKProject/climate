<p class="p">The specific hypotheses tested were that flooding and drought mediate the following: (1) a decline in the taxonomic and functional diversity of traits and (2) a shift in the mean functional trait values as depicted in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>. These responses will expectedly be strongest in near‐stream areas where the hydrological alterations are most pronounced and will intensify over time. Additionally, it was tested if (3) the taxonomic diversity and functional diversity of the seed pool were higher in flooded areas than in drought areas as the regional species pool may contribute to diversity through species dispersal by water (i.e., hydrochory; Nilsson, Brown, Jansson, &amp; Merritt,
