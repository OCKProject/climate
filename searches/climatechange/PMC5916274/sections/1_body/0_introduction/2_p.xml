<p class="p">In temperate regions, such as Northern and Central Europe, climate change‐associated alterations in precipitation patterns, with higher than average precipitation and less snow accumulation during winter and lower than average precipitation during summer, likely mediate significant alterations in the hydrological characteristics of lowland streams. In winter and early spring, an increase in the frequency, magnitude, and duration of flow events will occur (Karlsson, Sonnenborg, Seaby, Jensen, &amp; Refsgaard,

 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0067" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), whereas the frequency and duration of drought periods are expected to increase during summer (Andersen et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Higher temperatures will likely intensify deficits in water budgets during summer through enhanced evaporation and evapotranspiration, both of which will intensify water stress (Douville et al.,

Furthermore, higher temperatures may extend the active growth period of plants as growth may start earlier in spring and continue for a longer time, thereby possibly exacerbating the effects of flooding and droughts on natural ecosystems (Zwicke et al.,
