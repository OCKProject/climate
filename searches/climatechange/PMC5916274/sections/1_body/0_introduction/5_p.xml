<p class="p">In this study, we explored the effects of an experimentally altered hydrology on the taxonomic and functional trait characteristics of the vegetation and deposited seeds in riparian areas. To increase the predictive potential, we used a large‐scale experimental approach in which we manipulated water levels to disentangle the effects of specific environmental changes from co‐occurring environmental characteristics that may otherwise blur the responses (see Ackerly,

An additional strength of this approach was that the direct large‐scale water level manipulations applied permits creation of groundwater–surface water interactions resembling those likely to occur in riparian areas under current and expected rates of climatic change. To identify cross‐regional consistent patterns responses in the vegetation, the experimental sites were located in Denmark, Germany, and the Netherlands. In some parts of the sites, we experimentally increased flooding in the winter/spring and in other parts of the sites we increased droughts in summer.
