<p class="p">We analyzed regenerative traits and vegetative traits that we expected would change under altered hydrological conditions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). The selection of traits was based on theoretical considerations: Hydrological alterations are likely to affect traits associated with the ability to increase the water uptake and/or conserve water as well as traits associated with the ability to survive conditions with water surplus (Douma et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>; Hough‐Snee et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). The vegetative traits included leaf traits (specific leaf area, size, and mass), root traits (rooting depth and porosity), and canopy (maximum height) that may show an adaptive response to cope with an altered hydrology. Under drought conditions, we expected that the abundance of species with extensive rooting depths and species with dense stems, small and thick leaves, and low specific leaf areas would increase in abundance. These traits can serve to maximize water uptake and at the same time reduce water loss as the rate of transpiration generally decreases with declining specific leaf area and leaf mass (Wright et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33973-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Under flooded conditions, we expected that the abundance of species with traits associated with the ability to lower the metabolic activity (the “quiescence strategy”) or avoid unfavorable conditions (the “escape strategy”; Bailey‐Serres &amp; Voesenek, 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) would increase. Therefore, we anticipated that the abundance of tall species would increase as these have more easy access to atmospheric oxygen than short species. Additionally, we expected that species able to form porous roots or aerenchyma in adventitious roots to facilitate oxygen transport to the apical root zone (Armstrong, Brandle, &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>) would increase in abundance, as these traits can be critically important to maintain the exchange of gas under flooded conditions (Bailey‐Serres &amp; Voesenek, 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Garssen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). We also considered regenerative traits associated with the ability to disperse under drought and flooded conditions, respectively, including seed mass, volume, and buoyancy. Specifically, we expected that species with a high seed mass would decline in abundance with enhanced flooding concomitantly with an increase in species with a high seed buoyancy and volume, reflecting the adaptive value of producing low mass but high volume buoyant seeds that can disperse efficiently by water (Douma et al.,
