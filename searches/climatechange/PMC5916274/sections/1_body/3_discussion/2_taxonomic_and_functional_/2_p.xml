<p class="p">We found significant effects of flooding and drought on the species composition of both the vegetation and the seed pool in all study areas. Between‐study site variability was also prominent, and this is likely due to local differences in soil characteristics and/or hydrological conditions among the study sites that influence the effects of hydrological alterations on the riparian vegetation (Garssen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Despite the observed between‐study site variability, consistent patterns were also detected in response to hydrological changes. In particular, we observed a decline in both the taxonomic and functional diversity of the plant communities. The decline in taxonomic diversity in response to drought was only evident near the streams, probably reflecting that the experimental areas were already well drained and consequently less affected by the experiment (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33973-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), whereas the negative impacts of flooding on species diversity were more pronounced (although only significant after 3 years of flooding). This finding may indicate that fewer species were able to tolerate flooding within the area compared with the number of species able to tolerate (relatively mild) drought and/or that dispersal constraints were higher for species adapted to flooded conditions. Our findings are in line with those of Ström, Jansson, Nilsson, Johansson, and Xiong (

Species diversity increased rapidly in monoliths transplanted to higher elevations (i.e., less flooding) over the course of the 6‐year field study, while species diversity in monoliths transplanted to lower elevations (i.e., more flooding) declined rapidly (Ström et al.,
