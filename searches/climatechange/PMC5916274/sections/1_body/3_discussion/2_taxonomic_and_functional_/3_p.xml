<p class="p">Functional diversity also responded to the altered hydrological settings, in particular in proximity to the streams. We observed a significant decline in the functional diversity of all traits, indicating that the range of successful strategies displayed under the new hydrological settings was restricted. Our finding lends support to previous studies suggesting that strong abiotic filters constrain the range of species mean trait values that can exist within the community, leading to a convergent trait distribution (Bernard‐Verdier et al.,

In line with our observations for taxonomic diversity, also functional diversity responded more strongly to flooding than drought, indicating that flooding poses a more severe stress on the riparian community in temperate regions (Fraaije, Braak, Verduyn, Verhoeven, &amp; Soons,

 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Further studies are, however, needed to explore this topic, with special emphasis on how climate change‐mediated alterations in hydrological extremes in combination with a higher degree of unpredictability in the occurrence of these affect ecosystem functioning.
