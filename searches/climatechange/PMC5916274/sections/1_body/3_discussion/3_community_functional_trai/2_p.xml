<p class="p">The loss of functional diversity was also reflected in the mean trait response of the riparian plant community. We observed a consistent increase in the mean trait value of seed buoyancy in response to flooding, indicating that the fraction of species adapted to flooded conditions increased in the area. This finding is in accordance with Ozinga, Bekker, Schaminee, and Van Groenendael (
 <xref rid="ece33973-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) who, based on a classification of dispersal traits of ca. 900 species from different types of communities, found a highly significant correlation between the position of species along a wetness gradient and the frequency of morphological adaptations to hydrochory. This pattern has later been confirmed also for riparian and aquatic plant communities (van den Broek, van Diggelen, &amp; Bobbink,
