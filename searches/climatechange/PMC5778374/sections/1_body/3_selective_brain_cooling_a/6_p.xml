<p class="p">Survival of those predators depredating artiodactyls and perissodactyls may also depend on the predatorsâ€™ capacity for selective brain cooling, as selective brain cooling has been observed in heat-stressed domestic cats (

 <xref rid="cow078C4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Baker, 1984</xref>). The degree to which free-living felids and canids use selective brain cooling is currently not known. We also do not know, therefore, whether the evolutionary success of carnivores can be attributed to the development of their carotid rete, selective brain cooling and the conservation of body water. A better understanding of selective brain cooling, as a form of physiological plasticity that is available to some mammals, is integral to efforts to predict how mammals will respond to changing environments and how best to conserve them. The studies that are required are long-term investigations undertaken on a range of artiodactyl and carnivore species (

 <xref rid="cow078C45" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2014
 </xref>). Such studies should focus on identifiable individuals and their progeny, free-living in their natural environment, with the aim of relating varying levels of evolutionary success to the observed flexibility in selective brain cooling and resulting water savings.
