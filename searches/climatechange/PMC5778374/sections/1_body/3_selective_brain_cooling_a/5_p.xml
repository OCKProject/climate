<p class="p">Having survived and diversified dramatically during periods of pronounced aridification, the artiodactyls may be insulated, to a degree, from global warming and drying (
 <xref rid="cow078C86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell and Lust, 2008</xref>). Moreover, the observed inter-individual variability in selective brain cooling use within species implies that individual artiodactyls within populations, regardless of species or ecological water dependency, might have a relative evolutionary advantage in hotter, drier, less predictable environments. Representatives of the characteristic large herds of artiodactyls across various landscapes, which often also form the mainstay of large tracts of land under conservation management, therefore could persist through the Anthropocene. However, considering the continuing decrease in antelope populations across the globe (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>) and the poor performance of artiodactyls during mid-latitude glaciation of the Miocene to Pliocene transition, persistence through the Anthropocene may depend on the degree of intra-specific selective brain cooling plasticity. Indeed, artiodactyls such as the Arabian oryx may already be living close to their physiological tolerance levels. With a 24 h body temperature amplitude (maximum minus minimum 24 h body temperature) of up to 7.7°C during the summer, these animals are seasonally losing control of homeothermy as a result of water and nutritional stress (

As a consequence of a paucity of similar data from other artiodactyls, and also from perissodactyls, we know little about the physiological performance of these mammals under current environmental conditions and, ultimately, their ability to cope with a changing climate. Because perissodactyls, many of which are evolutionarily distinct (
 <xref rid="cow078C120" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Zoological Society of London, 2014</xref>), cannot use selective brain cooling to conserve body water, concerted conservation efforts may be required as conditions become drier under anthropogenic climate change. Yet such conservation efforts should not be to the detriment of other species sensitive to disturbance (see, for example,
