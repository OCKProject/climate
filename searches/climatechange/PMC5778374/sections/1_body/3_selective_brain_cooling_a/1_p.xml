<p class="p">Water economy strategies in artiodactyls provide compelling evidence that selective brain cooling can mitigate negative population responses to warming and aridification. The use of selective brain cooling offers significant water savings to artiodactyls, but it is not the only mechanism by which they can save water. Dehydration itself reduces evaporative water loss via osmosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus, even in the absence of selective brain cooling (

However, unlike dehydration or blood osmolality, selective brain cooling can be switched off rapidly (probably within seconds) by high cranial sympathetic activity. That property of selective brain cooling potentially conveys a survival benefit (

 </xref>). For example, should an artiodactyl in a hot environment and implementing selective brain cooling be confronted by a flight-or-fight situation, its selective brain cooling would be abolished immediately by increased sympathetic tone. Consequently, hypothalamic temperature would increase, and the hypothalamic drive on evaporative cooling would be restored immediately, with the full power of evaporative cooling invoked to dissipate the extra metabolic heat. Immediate survival outweighs the longer-term benefits of body water conservation, and the artiodactyl makes temporary use of full evaporative cooling to avoid a potentially lethal hyperthermia. When the threat has receded, selective brain cooling can again be initiated and evaporative water loss suppressed. Thus, selective brain cooling may bestow benefits for survival in arid environments in two ways: (i) switching selective brain cooling on conserves body water, improving long-term survival; whereas (ii) switching selective brain cooling off rapidly accelerates evaporative cooling to avoid lethal hyperthermia, thereby supporting immediate survival.
