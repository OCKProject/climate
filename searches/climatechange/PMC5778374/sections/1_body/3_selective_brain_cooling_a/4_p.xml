<p class="p">Among artiodactyl species, there may be innate differences between species in their capacity for selective brain cooling, which may facilitate the persistence of those species with enhanced selective brain cooling in a hotter and drier Anthropocene. Although it has not been possible logistically, to date, to measure the water savings that result from selective brain cooling in free-living artiodactyls, we recently investigated selective brain cooling in three sympatric antelope species with different water dependencies and determined the dimensions of their carotid retes (

 </xref>). Individuals of all three species, living free in their natural habitats under the same environmental conditions, used selective brain cooling, but we found no differences in selective brain cooling use between the gemsbok that is independent of surface water, the red hartebeest of intermediate water dependency and the blue wildebeest that is dependent on surface water and has to drink water daily. In fact, we found more variability in selective brain cooling use within those species than between those species in a habitat in which surface water was available

 </xref>). The observed variability in use of selective brain cooling within these three species living in exactly the same environmental conditions reaffirms the concept that selective brain cooling is not simply under thermal control (in the sense that there is a threshold temperature at which it is initiated). Moreover, the plasticity in the use of selective brain cooling may provide a physiological feature for selection in the face of anthropogenic climate change, as numerous regions are expected to become hotter and drier, with increased variability in rainfall (
