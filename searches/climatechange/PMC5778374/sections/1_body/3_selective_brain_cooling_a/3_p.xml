<p class="p">This pattern of selective-brain-cooling-related survivorship is corroborated by evolutionary patterns of the Tragulidae. Although they are small-bodied artiodactyls with a rudimentary capacity for rumination, tragulids do not possess a carotid rete. Therefore, they can be considered to ruminate but not to selective brain cool. The earliest record of tragulids and other closely related small-bodied primitive ruminants is the Late Eocene to Early Oligocene (

 <xref rid="cow078C69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kunzmann, 2012</xref>). Since that period, these non-selective-brain-cooling taxa have experienced declines in generic richness even as more advanced ruminants have increased in diversity (

Thus, although diet undoubtedly plays a role in the extinction and survivorship capacity of any taxon, failure to incorporate selective brain cooling not only leaves early artiodactyl evolution unsatisfactorily explained, but it renders an incomplete evaluation of these species’ abilities to persist into the Anthropocene.
