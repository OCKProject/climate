 <xref rid="cow078C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuhnen (1997)</xref> used extracorporeal heat exchangers to manipulate selective brain cooling and measured respiratory evaporative heat loss. The experimental inhibition of selective brain cooling resulted in a reduced trunk threshold for respiratory evaporative heat loss; therefore, evaporative water loss occurred at lower body temperatures, as well as at a higher overall rate. At an aortic blood temperature of 40°C, selective brain cooling of only 0.5°C reduced respiratory water loss by 0.72 l day
