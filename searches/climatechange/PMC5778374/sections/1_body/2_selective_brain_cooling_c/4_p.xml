<p class="p">Thus, the reduction of hypothalamic temperature by the 1Â°C or less that selective brain cooling can achieve reduces evaporative cooling during heat exposure sufficiently to save a substantial portion of the water that an artiodactyl would need to access each day. How does an artiodactyl continue to maintain heat balance if its evaporative cooling is attenuated? The attenuation of evaporative cooling by selective brain cooling results in an increase in body temperature, including skin temperature (

 </xref>). In environments in which an artiodactyl can lose heat by radiation and convection, the higher skin temperature will enhance radiant and convective heat loss, so selective brain cooling will switch heat loss from evaporative to non-evaporative channels. If an artiodactyl is in an environment in which it is gaining heat, the rate of heat gain will be reduced by the higher skin temperature. In the process of conserving water, however, the artiodactyl may store heat during hot periods of the day. As selective brain cooling generally is used late in the afternoon (Fig.
