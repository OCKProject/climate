<p class="p">Recently, in the laboratory, we quantified the total water savings attributable to selective brain cooling in Dorper sheep. We used the stable hydrogen isotope deuterium oxide (D
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) to measure water turnover in sheep that were deprived of drinking water and naturally making use of selective brain cooling. The sheep lost a quarter of their body water over 5 days of water deprivation. The threshold temperature for selective brain cooling remained unchanged, but those individuals that used selective brain cooling more frequently, or of greater magnitude, had lower water turnover rates (they therefore conserved body water better) than did conspecifics that used selective brain cooling less frequently or of smaller magnitude. We showed that a 50 kg sheep that used selective brain cooling for half of a day would save 2.4 litres of water that day, the equivalent of ~60% of the daily water requirement of a Dorper sheep not exposed to heat (
