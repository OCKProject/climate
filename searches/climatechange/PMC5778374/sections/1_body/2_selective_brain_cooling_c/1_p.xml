<p class="p">In dehydrated mammals, increased osmotic pressure of the arterial blood perfusing the brain inhibits thermoregulatory responses to heat (

 <xref rid="cow078C23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Doris, 1983</xref>). If hyperosmolality also enhances selective brain cooling, then what would be the benefit to artiodactyls? In goats, at least, but presumably also in other artiodactyls, the neural drive for respiratory evaporative heat loss is provided about equally by thermoreceptors in the hypothalamus and thermoreceptors within the trunk (
 <xref rid="cow078C56" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jessen and Feistkorn, 1984</xref>). During selective brain cooling, input from the hypothalamic temperature sensors would be attenuated. Consequently, panting and sweating, the main physiological avenues of evaporative heat loss in artiodactyls, would be attenuated. The potential water savings as a result of selective brain cooling could be substantial considering that a 1°C decrease in brain temperature resulted in a ~6-fold decrease in respiratory evaporative water loss in goats (
 <xref rid="cow078C67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuhnen and Jessen, 1994</xref>). The hypothalamic thermosensitivity for evaporative water loss in goats is therefore high. We calculated the hypothalamic thermosensitivity for evaporative water loss for goats, at a trunk temperature of 40°C, to be 0.35 W kg

 <xref rid="cow078C108" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stitt, 1976</xref>). The hypothalamic thermosensitivity is therefore 10 times greater in the heat-exposed goat than in the heat-exposed rabbit. A relatively small change in the hypothalamic temperature of the goat (tenths of a degree Celsius) therefore can result in significant water savings as a result of decreased evaporative water loss.
