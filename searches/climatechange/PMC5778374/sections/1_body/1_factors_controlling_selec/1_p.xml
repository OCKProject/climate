<p class="p">Control mechanisms govern the onset and degree of selective brain cooling in mammals with a carotid rete. The finding that selective brain cooling typically is exhibited by tame or habituated mammals when exposed to heat or exercise indicated that a primary input to the control of selective brain cooling is the mammal's internal temperature (
