<p class="p">A role for sympathetic nervous system activity in the modulation of selective brain cooling was revealed through a series of elegant experiments on reindeer (

 <xref rid="cow078C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Johnsen and Folkow, 1988</xref>). Experiments on habituated artiodactyls showed that selective brain cooling could be controlled by directing the passage of venous blood draining the evaporating surfaces of the head either to the cavernous sinus, classically via the angularis oculi veins, or to the jugular vein via the facial vein, bypassing the cavernous sinus (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F3" class="xref">3</xref>). The default direction of blood flow appears to be via the cavernous sinus, so increased cranial blood flow in heat-stressed artiodactyls (

 <xref rid="cow078C112" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vesterdorf 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011
 </xref>) led to increased flow of cooled venous blood to the cavernous sinus; hence, increased selective brain cooling. Increased cranial sympathetic nervous system activity, however, led to simultaneous contraction of a muscular sphincter in the angularis oculi vein (α-adrenergic) and dilatation of a similar sphincter in the facial vein (β-adrenergic), resulting in venous blood bypassing the cavernous sinus and returning via the jugular vein to the heart (

 <xref rid="cow078C59" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Johnsen and Folkow, 1988</xref>). Although this differential vasoconstriction can modulate the degree of selective brain cooling, it does not fully explain the control of selective brain cooling in artiodactyls. In addition to the angularis oculi veins, less superficial veins, such as the sphenopalatine, external ophthalmic and ethmoidal veins, also supply venous blood to the cavernous sinus (

 <xref rid="cow078C17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Carlton and McKean, 1977</xref>). As a result, severing the angularis oculi veins does not completely eliminate selective brain cooling (
 <xref rid="cow078C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuller 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011
 </xref>). High sympathetic tone attenuates selective brain cooling not only by constricting the angularis oculi veins, but also by constricting nasal mucosal blood vessels and closing arteriovenous anastomoses. Within the nasal mucosa, the rate of heat extraction is attenuated through a combination of reduced blood flow and the restriction of airway width (
 <xref rid="cow078C77" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Malm, 1973</xref>). Thus, increased cranial sympathetic nervous system activity decreases blood flow to the evaporating surfaces of the head as well as redirecting the flow of venous blood leaving those surfaces away from the cavernous sinus (

 <xref rid="cow078C33" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuller 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2011
 </xref>). These changes result in an upward shift of the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling, as documented in springbok (

 <xref rid="cow078C84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell

 <xref rid="cow078C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jessen 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1994
 </xref>). Free-living mammals rarely engage in intensive exercise except for predator–prey interactions, during which there is a dramatic increase in sympathetic nervous system activity in both predator and prey. The sympathetic activity prevalent during flight and fright in wild artiodactyls abolishes selective brain cooling (
 <xref rid="cow078C57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jessen 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1994
 </xref>), overriding the drive of high body temperature. Selective brain cooling observed in tame artiodactyls exercising at low or moderate intensity is likely to be associated with low sympathetic activity (
