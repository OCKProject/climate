<p class="p">Although it is not as strong as in intense exercise during predatorâ€“prey interactions, there is also sympathetic activation during psychological stress. The effects of psychological stress, including an increase in body and brain temperatures, are well documented, even in mammals lacking a carotid rete, such as rats (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2008
 </xref>). For example, individual roe deer (

 <xref rid="cow078C88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Monestier 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>) and therefore, presumably, different levels of sympathetic activation. Individual variability in sympathetic responses to the same stressor may contribute to an underlying plasticity in the control of selective brain cooling (
