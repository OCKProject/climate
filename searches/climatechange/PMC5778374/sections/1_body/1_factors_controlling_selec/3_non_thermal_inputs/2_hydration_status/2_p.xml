<p class="p">The enhancement of selective brain cooling by water deprivation has been confirmed in more controlled conditions, in which domestic artiodactyls can be handled for sample collection (

 <italic class="italic">Ovis aries</italic>) were deprived of drinking water and exposed to diurnal heat load, after the third day of water deprivation, when the water reservoir within the rumen would have been depleted, plasma osmolality and selective brain cooling magnitude increased in a near-linear manner and in unison (Fig.

 <xref rid="cow078C109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Strauss 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>). After 5 days of water deprivation, the 24 h mean magnitude of selective brain cooling was three times greater (0.9 vs. 0.3°C) than that during euhydration (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F5" class="xref">5</xref>B). The proportion of time during which the sheep used selective brain cooling also differed markedly depending on hydration status. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F5" class="xref">5</xref>C shows that the sheep used some selective brain cooling at all times of the day regardless of hydration status. However, when dehydrated, the sheep used selective brain cooling more frequently at all times of day, but especially during the daylight hours when selective brain cooling, on average, was used 75% of the time. Water deprivation, presumably acting through hyperosmolality, therefore appears to be a driver of selective brain cooling.
