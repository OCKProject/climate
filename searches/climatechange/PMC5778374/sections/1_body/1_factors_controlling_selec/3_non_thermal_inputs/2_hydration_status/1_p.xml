 <xref rid="cow078C32" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fuller 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (2007)
 </xref> showed that sheep exhibited a higher magnitude of selective brain cooling during dehydration even when carotid arterial blood temperature did not increase. Water deprivation on its own therefore seems to be a sufficient stimulus to enhance selective brain cooling. That idea is supported by measurement of selective brain cooling in antelope living free in arid environments. In the hyper-arid desert of Saudi Arabia, the mean magnitude of selective brain cooling in free-living Arabian oryx (
 <italic class="italic">Oryx leucoryx</italic>) peaked in the afternoon (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F4" class="xref">4</xref>A), well after solar noon and maximal heat load, as measured with miniature black globe thermometers on the collar of the animals (
 <xref rid="cow078C42" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2007
 </xref>). Water availability, or aridity, appeared to have been the main factor determining the use and magnitude of selective brain cooling, with selective brain cooling being enhanced in the dry period compared with the wet period (
 <xref rid="cow078C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2012
 </xref>). During the hot dry period when no drinking water was available, the Arabian oryx made near-continuous use of selective brain cooling during the 4Â h leading to sunset (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F5" class="xref">5</xref>B, grey bars), compared with no more than 40% of the time during the warm wet period, when the oryx presumably had access to drinking water or food with a higher moisture content (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F4" class="xref">4</xref>B, black bars). Despite being exposed to similar ambient temperatures, Arabian oryx, in the hyper-arid desert of Saudi Arabia, also showed enhanced selective brain cooling compared with the congeneric gemsbok with free access to water (
 <xref rid="cow078C80" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maloney 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2002
 </xref>), as they initiated selective brain cooling at a lower threshold temperature and used selective brain cooling more frequently and at greater magnitude than did the gemsbok (
