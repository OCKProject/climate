<p class="p">The typical relationship between hypothalamic temperature and pre-rete carotid arterial blood temperature in artiodactyls with carotid retes is shown in Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref> (right panels). At the lower carotid arterial blood temperatures, brain temperature is higher than, and runs in parallel to, carotid arterial blood temperature, as illustrated for one gemsbok (
 <italic class="italic">Oryx gazella</italic>, upper panel), one red hartebeest (
 <italic class="italic">Alcelaphus buselaphus</italic>, middle panel) and one blue wildebeest (
 <italic class="italic">Connochaetes taurinus</italic>, lower panel) over the same 5 day period. In that temperature regime, in all mammals, whether or not they have a carotid rete, hypothalamic temperature generally exceeds carotid arterial blood temperature by about 0.2–0.5°C (
 <xref rid="cow078C81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Maloney 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2007
 </xref>). As carotid arterial blood temperature increases, hypothalamic temperature uncouples from carotid arterial blood temperature, as selective brain cooling ensues in those species with a carotid rete. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref> also illustrates two variables that can be used to characterize selective brain cooling (red arrows): the temperature at which hypothalamic temperature and carotid arterial blood temperature are equal, which is the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling (
 <xref rid="cow078C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuhnen and Jessen, 1991</xref>), and the extent to which brain temperature drops below carotid arterial blood temperature, the magnitude of selective brain cooling. The threshold temperature for selective brain cooling can differ, not only between species simultaneously exposed to the same environmental conditions (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref>), but also both between individuals within a species (

  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>) and within an individual when exposed to different environmental conditions (
 <xref rid="cow078C44" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2012
 </xref>), with the threshold temperature for selective brain cooling being reduced under high heat loads (
