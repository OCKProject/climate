<p class="p">The finding that hyperthermia is a not a prerequisite for selective brain cooling is confirmed by measurements of the threshold temperature in many species (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="cow078TB1" class="xref">1</xref>); it typically lies between 38 and 39°C (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="cow078TB1" class="xref">1</xref>), close to the modal and mean body core temperature of artiodactyls (
 <xref rid="cow078C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>). In captive mammals, the magnitude of selective brain cooling typically increases with increasing carotid arterial blood temperature, but in free-living wild mammals it is more variable. Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref> (left panels) illustrates the carotid arterial blood and hypothalamic temperatures of three individual artiodactyls, a gemsbok (upper panel), a red hartebeest (middle panel) and a blue wildebeest (lower panel), living free in the same habitat and measured over the same 24 h period (
 <xref rid="cow078C110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Strauss 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>). Like other large mammals (

 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="cow078C46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hetem 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>), these antelope had a 24 h rhythm of arterial blood temperature, with a trough soon after dawn and a peak in the late afternoon (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref>, grey line). Hypothalamic temperature (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref>, black line), which is determined mainly by post-carotid rete arterial blood temperature (
 <xref rid="cow078C40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hayward 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1966
 </xref>), had a 24 h pattern similar to that of carotid arterial blood temperature, and the individuals from the three species exhibited a pattern of selective brain cooling similar to that typically exhibited by other free-living artiodactyls (

 <xref rid="cow078C110" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Strauss 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>). As carotid arterial blood temperature approached its 24 h peak, hypothalamic temperature uncoupled from carotid arterial blood temperature, and selective brain cooling ensued. Although selective brain cooling could be implemented at any time of the day (e.g. Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cow078F2" class="xref">2</xref>, middle left panel), its magnitude typically was greatest (0.5–1.5°C; Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="cow078TB1" class="xref">1</xref>) around the time of the 24 h peak in carotid arterial blood temperature. At that time of day, environmental heat load was decreasing, and the antelope usually were involved in low-intensity activities, such as rumination and grazing. Despite strong thermal inputs at that time of day, however, selective brain cooling in artiodactyls can be modulated by non-thermal inputs, such that its magnitude can be further increased or it can even be completely abolished.
