<p class="p">Soon after the heat-exchange function of the carotid rete was discovered, investigations of selective brain cooling in domesticated and habituated wild mammals in captivity led to the conclusion that selective brain cooling served to protect the brain from reaching dangerously high temperatures (

 <xref rid="cow078C83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1987
 </xref>). That conclusion was influenced heavily by one measurement of selective brain cooling. 
 <xref rid="cow078C111" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Taylor and Lyman (1972)</xref> reported that brain temperature after induced exercise in habituated Thomson's gazelle (
 <italic class="italic">Gazella thomsonii</italic>) was as much as 2.7°C lower than carotid arterial blood temperature, a magnitude of selective brain cooling never seen before or since by anyone else, in any mammal. A protectionist function fitted well with the perceived vulnerability of brain tissue to thermal damage

 <xref rid="cow078C14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burger and Fuhrman, 1964</xref>). Only when it was shown that goats (
 <italic class="italic">Capra hircus</italic>) could withstand brain temperatures of 42.5°C for an hour without any apparent ill effect (
 <xref rid="cow078C16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Caputa 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1986b
 </xref>) did it become apparent that the brain was not as vulnerable to thermal damage as believed previously (
 <xref rid="cow078C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2002
 </xref>). Indeed, rather than the brain, it is the tissue of the gastrointestinal tract that is most susceptible to thermal damage (
 <xref rid="cow078C12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Braasch, 1964</xref>), attributable to reduced splanchnic blood flow and endotoxin leakage (
 <xref rid="cow078C505" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Leon and Helwig, 2010</xref>). Subsequent studies of free-living and unrestrained mammals have revealed that selective brain cooling is not obligatory at high body temperatures (
 <xref rid="cow078C85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mitchell 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2002
 </xref>) and, as first noted in a laboratory study on goats, it is part of the normothermic thermoregulatory repertoire of artiodactyls (
 <xref rid="cow078C66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuhnen and Jessen, 1991</xref>). Rather than functioning primarily to protect the brain from thermal damage, selective brain cooling modulates the use of body water for thermoregulation (
 <xref rid="cow078C58" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jessen 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 1998
 </xref>). By reducing the temperature of the hypothalamus, where the temperature sensors that provide the internal drive for heat loss are located, selective brain cooling reduces evaporative water loss (
 <xref rid="cow078C65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kuhnen, 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="cow078C109" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Strauss 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2015
 </xref>). In the context of this alternative role for selective brain cooling, now described in textbooks of animal physiology (for example, 
 <xref rid="cow078C115" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Willmer 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2009
 </xref>; 
 <xref rid="cow078C117" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Withers 
  <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 2016
 </xref>), we provide here a perspective on the evolutionary and functional significance of selective brain cooling and its potential to provide physiological plasticity for artiodactyls facing hotter and drier environments associated with current climate change.
