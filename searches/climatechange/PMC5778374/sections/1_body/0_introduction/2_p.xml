<p class="p">The function of the carotid rete in the Cetacea is unknown, but in the terrestrial artiodactyls, cats and dogs, it is a heat exchanger that can be used to cool the brain, but importantly, the hypothalamic region, below the temperature of carotid arterial blood. This phenomenon, known as ‘selective brain cooling’, first was described in a domestic cat (

The brain, as a metabolically active organ, usually has a temperature higher than that of the arterial blood perfusing it. The heat produced by the brain is removed by that blood, meaning that in the absence of a carotid rete, the brain is ~0.5°C warmer than arterial blood leaving the heart (

 </xref>). The venous blood is derived from the maxilloturbinates and other mucous surfaces of the mouth and nose, where it is cooled to well below arterial blood temperature by evaporation of water into inspired air, whether or not the mammal is panting (

The thin walls and large surface area of the carotid rete vessels allow for efficient heat exchange between the arterial and venous blood, the result being that the arterial blood exiting the carotid rete into the brain and, subsequently, the hypothalamic tissue in that region, can be more than 1°C cooler than arterial blood entering the rete (
