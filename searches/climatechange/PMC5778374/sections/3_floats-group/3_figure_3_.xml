  <p class="p">Diagram illustrating the position of the carotid rete in artiodactyls, located within a cavernous sinus at the base of the brain, as well as the main arterial blood supply to the brain, via the carotid rete. During selective brain cooling, cool venous blood from the nasal mucosa drains into the cavernous sinus via the angularis oculi vein (as well as some deeper veins; see
