  <p class="p">Summary of the effects of water deprivation on selective brain cooling in Dorper sheep. (
   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) The relationship between the mean (±SD) magnitude of selective brain cooling (carotid blood temperature minus hypothalamic temperature, black bars) and osmolality (grey bars) during 5 days of water deprivation; the black bracket indicates the period of water deprivation. (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) The mean (±SD) 24 h magnitude of selective brain cooling during euhydration (black line, days 1 and 2 in A) and dehydration (grey line, days 7 and 8 in A); horizontal black bars along the 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis depict night-time. (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) The proportion of time that the sheep spent using selective brain cooling throughout the 24 h period when euhydrated (black bars; days 1 and 2 in A) and when dehydrated (grey bars; days 7 and 8 in A); the black bracket indicates the period of heat exposure (09:00–15:00) and the horizontal black bars along the 
   <italic class="italic">x</italic>-axis depict night-time. Data from
