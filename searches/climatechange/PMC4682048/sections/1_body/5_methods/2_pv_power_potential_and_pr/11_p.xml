<p class="p">Using the PVpot time series estimated as described above and the 2050 spatial scenario of PV power-installed capacity, 3-h time series of PV power generation were obtained for each grid cell of the domain holding PV power units. These series were finally aggregated per region, considering those regions for which the aforementioned 2050 targets were specified (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). As a result, nine 3-h time series of PV power generation spanning the period 1970â€“2099 were obtained, one per region, from each one of the available simulations. Ensemble mean values of their means and standard deviations (as computed here to assess changes in time variability) are presented in
