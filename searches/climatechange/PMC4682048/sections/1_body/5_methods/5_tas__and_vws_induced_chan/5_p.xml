<p class="p">Hence, taking ΔRSDS=ΔVWS=0 in equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq5" class="xref">(5)</xref>, the change in PVpot due to a change in TAS can be obtained. Analogously, the change in PVpot due to the influence of changes in VWS alone is given by imposing ΔRSDS=ΔTAS=0 in equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq5" class="xref">(5)</xref>. This is the procedure adopted here, as it was done in previous works
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. However, note that the cross-products in the last two terms of equation 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq5" class="xref">(5)</xref> make it impossible to fully isolate the contribution of each single field.
