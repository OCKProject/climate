<p class="p">Seasonally (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 4</xref>), the largest ensemble mean RSDS change signals (expressed in absolute terms, that is, in W m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>) occur in spring and summer, when most PV power is produced. The latitudinal pattern (positive southwards and negative northwards) is found in all seasons. These changes, combined with the lower-order effect of changes in TAS and VWS, lead to changes in PVpot that expressed in relative terms (that is, %), are largest in winter (up to −20%) and smallest in summer. However, in summer, the discrepancy in the sign of the change between individual significant signals provides non-robust ensemble mean signals in large areas of Central Europe, a feature not seen in the other seasons.
