<p id="Par31" class="p">As the subtitle indicates, the Decalogue plans to carry out a prevention campaign to reduce the amount of pollen in the air without sacrificing public green areas. To this end, the document adopted by the SIAAIC TF proposes “simple actions” concerning the management and care of plants, targeting several factors affecting allergen concentrations, including the “pollen calendar,” namely the recording of seasonal peaks of airborne pollen concentrations. The SIAAIC TF believes that compliance with the provisions of the Decalogue can help meet the campaign goal, that is, reducing the concentrations of airborne allergenic pollen in the cities. Among the forthcoming activities, the TF is preparing aerobiology courses, as well as the creation of a national SIAAIC aerobiology network for the monitoring of allergies across the country.</p>
