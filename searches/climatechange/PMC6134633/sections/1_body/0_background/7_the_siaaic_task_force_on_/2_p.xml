<p id="Par30" class="p">The SIAAIC TF launched a project divided into 3 successive steps. The first step involved the establishment of a multidisciplinary expert group, including high-profile academic, institutional and associative figures working in the field of “Air Pollution and Climate Change” at the legal, environmental and institutional levels. SIAAIC Allergists and Clinical Immunologists were clearly involved in this group. The second step of the project (“exploratory step”) included the collection of national and European data on climate and environmental changes. The third step of the TF’s work, still underway, focused on the preparation of a final document (Report or Guidelines) to raise awareness about “Air Pollution and Climate Change” and their impact on Immunological and Allergic Diseases. The TF also planned the production of a “synthetic” version of the document intended for the public, as well as the preparation of a Decalogue to be sent to local administrators with a set of rules aimed at protecting public health. Starting from this initial proposal, and as a result of its regular activities during these years, the Task Force on Air Pollution and Climate Change of the Italian Society of Allergology, Asthma and Clinical Immunology (SIAAIC) has proposed a National Healthcare Program to help the cities’ public administrations in choosing non allergenic trees in public parks. The “DECALOGUE: ALLERGY SAFE TREE” document suggests how to use non allergenic trees in gardens and public parks [
