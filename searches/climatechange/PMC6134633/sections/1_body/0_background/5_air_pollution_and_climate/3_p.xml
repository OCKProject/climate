<p id="Par11" class="p">Several epidemiological studies have demonstrated a close association between global warming, air pollution and respiratory allergic diseases, such as bronchial asthma and rhinitis. Climate changes affect the quantity, quality, timing and distribution of aeroallergens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. The increased atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations due to fossil fuel burning stimulate the growth of plants, including allergenic species. On top of that, higher temperatures can lead to earlier and longer pollination seasons, leading to increased pollen sensitization rate and symptom duration. Individuals with asthma are at increased risk of developing obstructive airway attacks when exposed to gaseous and particulate components of air pollution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. In addition, air pollution can modify the allergenic potential of pollens, especially in the presence of favourable weather conditions. Air pollution—in particular PM, diesel exhaust particles (DEP), ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide—have been shown to have an inflammatory effect on the airways of susceptible subjects, causing increased mucosal permeability, facilitating the penetration and access of inhaled allergens to the cells of the immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>]. There are also data suggesting that air pollution can lead to the development of asthma. Therefore, climate change combined with air pollution may have severe impacts on respiratory health, especially in children.
