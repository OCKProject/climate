 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Higher temperatures can also induce the migration of stinging and biting insects into new environments, as well as increasing the population of existing insect species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>]. Indeed, climate changes and globalization are altering the distribution and consistency of allergenic species including venomous insects. In particular, given the expansion of native species and the colonization of invasive ones, one can predict, despite the uncertainty of current models, that stinging Hymenoptera will pose new challenges in the future [
