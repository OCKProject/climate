<p id="Par10" class="p">A large body of evidence suggests that climate change have significant health impacts, both direct and indirect. Direct health impacts include morbidity and mortality associated with direct exposure to hazardous weather conditions such as heat waves, floods, cyclones, etc. Indirect health impacts, which include the majority of climate change-related diseases, are mediated by environmental conditions which affect the spatial and temporal distribution of aeroallergens, the generation and dispersion of air pollutants, and the population of disease-transmitting vectors like mosquitoes and ticks.</p>
