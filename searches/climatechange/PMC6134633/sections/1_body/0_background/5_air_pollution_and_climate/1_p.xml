<p id="Par9" class="p">Global warming is a major public health emergency. Global temperature has risen markedly over the last 50Â years and is still rising, as demonstrated by warming of the oceans, rising sea levels, melting of glaciers, retreating of Arctic sea ice, and diminishing snow cover in the Northern Hemisphere. Climate change is also associated with extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes. These changes are probably due to increased emissions of greenhouse gases (namely, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide), largely from anthropogenic sources. Projections of future greenhouse gas emissions indicate a worsening of the situation with further increase in average temperatures and temperature extremes by the end of the twenty-first century [
