<p id="Par18" class="p">In summary, air pollution and climate change-related health impacts are enormous and are expected to increase during the next decades. As a result, also the social and economic costs of climate change are enormous and will increase in the future. Nevertheless, there is a relative scarcity of economic studies on the health impacts of climate change. Most studies have estimated the economic costs of extreme weather events or the impacts of climate change on respiratory diseases and infectious diseases (vector borne, water related, and food borne). However, these economic studies are heterogeneous in terms of objectives and methodology. To this end, a review has pointed out the need for climate change-specific health economic guidelines to provide a standardized approach and stimulate economic research [

A more recent review, conducted to evaluate the health costs resulting from human exposure to weather-related extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, floods, storms and hurricanes, has highlighted a lack of evidence about the potential cost-effectiveness of interventions that exploits the capacity of natural ecosystems to reduce exposure to extreme events, despite the observations that evidence that poor land management increases the vulnerability to these events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>]. However, all studies identified in this review indicate that the health costs associated with the impacts of extreme events are substantial. For example, six climate change-related events that struck the United States between 2000 and 2009, accounted for about $14 billion in lost lives and health costs [
