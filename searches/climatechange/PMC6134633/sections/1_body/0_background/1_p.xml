<p id="Par5" class="p">Climate change is already underway and is expected to continue in the next decades: temperatures are increasing, global precipitation patterns are changing, ice and snow are melting, and global average sea level is rising. Moreover, the impact of global warming on human health has been documented by several reports from the World Health Organization (WHO) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], which illustrate that a major concern about this phenomenon is the increase in air pollution levels. In this respect, the last report of the European Environment Agency (EEA) indicates that up to 96% of the urban population in the European Union are exposed to particulate and fine dust levels in excess of threshold values [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. In addition to air pollution produced by hydrocarbon combustion emissions, there is another issue: the formation of particles related to global warming, and the presence of gases, such as ozone, with generation of a mixture of particles in the atmosphere, called particulate matter (PM) or particle pollution. Environmental PM is a heterogeneous mixture of particles produced by various processes, whose size ranges from 2.5 to 10 μm. The fine particulate fraction (PM2.5) (also known as “fine particles”) consists of particles with a size of 2.5 microns (or smaller), while the ultrafine particulate fraction (also known as “ultrafine particles”) consists of particles with a size smaller than 0.1 μm. The latter has a variable chemical composition, with the highest volatility, which is obviously due to its smaller size. It should also be noted that, although the ultrafine fraction represents less than 1% of the particulate mass, it is suspected of causing the greatest harm to the exposed population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Importantly, this particulate fraction can reach the deepest parts of the bronchial tree, leading to major inflammatory and procarcinogenic effects on the bronchial mucosa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>]. Of note, PM is also involved in other diseases, including cardiovascular disorders such as coronary heart disease and heart failure. These conditions are mainly due to the oxidative stress generated by the inflammatory response, with both short- and long-term adverse effects on human health through a variety of mechanisms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>]. In addition, it has been demonstrated that exposure to ozone and PM2.5 induces adverse health effects, including various pulmonary diseases and lung cancer. Overall, air pollution-related global mortality has been associated with several emission sources; therefore, air pollution control can be an effective strategy to reduce mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Both concentrations and chemical composition of PM show a large variability not only geographic, but also seasonal. PM concentrations are usually higher in urban areas than in rural areas. With regard to seasonal variability, PM levels increase significantly during the winter due to increased emissions from road traffic and residential heating, and decrease during spring and summer when pollen concentrations are typically highest [
