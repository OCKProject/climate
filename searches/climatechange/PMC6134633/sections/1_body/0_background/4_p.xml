<p id="Par8" class="p">In recent years, air quality has improved in industrialized Western countries, while it has worsened in developing countries. In Asia, for example, anthropogenic emissions have increased in recent decades with the rapid development of urbanization and industrialization. On the contrary, aerosol emissions have declined in North America and Europe with the relocation of factories to developing countries and with the adoption of more stringent clean air regulations in Western countries. However, it may be difficult to define the amount of air pollution in different areas of the world, since most aerosols remain suspended in the atmosphere for short periods, typically between 4Â days and a week. PM particles in the atmosphere can move at 5 m (16.4 ft) per second, and may travel thousands of kilometres in a week, making it difficult to accurately measure pollution levels; consequently, any predictions about the deterioration of air quality can be distorted by this initial bias, especially with regard to time.</p>
