<p id="Par19" class="p">The mechanisms by which PM affects human health are still debated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>]. The atmosphere is the medium of transit not only for pollutant gases and particles, but also for a wide variety of biogenic materials of plant and animal origin. Among biogenic materials, there is the bioaerosol, which consists of different kinds of airborne particles such as viruses, bacteria, moulds, plant fibres, and also pollen with variable sizes, ranging from tens of nanometers to a few hundreds of micrometers. These biological substances are involved in allergic and respiratory diseases, and act both directly and indirectly on airway epithelial cells. The increased concentration of pollen and air pollutants can activate different epithelial and immune cells in the airways, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>]. However, the specific components and the mechanisms responsible for oxidative stress following exposure to PM are not fully understood. Direct oxidant production by air pollution particles in epithelial cells of the respiratory mucosa has been reported. This effect has been attributed to both organic components and a number of heavy metals (e.g., arsenic, cadmium, chromium, mercury, nickel, lead, and thallium). These metals have a wide distribution in the environment as a result of their multiple industrial, domestic, agricultural, medical, and technological applications, which raises many concerns about their potential effects on human health and the environment. The main consequences of oxidative stress include the activation of specific cellular reactions (including activation of kinases and transcription factors), the release of inflammatory mediators, and eventually cell damage or apoptosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. All this promotes bronchial hyperreactivity as well as a decline in pulmonary function, increasing the risk of allergic sensitisation, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cancer. Recent epigenetic studies have shown that a number of genes controlling immune and inflammatory responses are sensitive to tropospheric ozone. Indeed, atmospheric pollutants like diesel exhaust particles [particulate] (DEPs) and ozone are directly involved in asthma pathogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. Importantly, DEPs are a major component of traffic-related particulate air pollution in most urban areas. In addition, a number of evidence indicates that DEPs may facilitate entry of allergens into the airways eliciting immunopathological response, and can also bind pollen, dog, cat, and house dust mite allergens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>]. Due to their very fine size, DEPs can facilitate the penetration of these allergens into the lungs, thereby increasing the amount of allergens interacting with the airway epithelium. It has also been demonstrated that DEPs can disrupt pollen particles causing the release of allergenic sub-pollen particles. Interestingly, a detailed analysis of pollen taken from air-polluted areas showed an increased amount of allergenic proteins with higher allergenic potential. In another study, comparing recent and decade-old pollen extracts, the recent pollen extract showed higher allergenic potency. In addition, the recent pollen extract obtained from the urban area had a higher allergenic potency than the recent pollen extract from the suburban area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. More recently, the same authors of the above study demonstrated that a recent pollen extract from an urban area significantly exposed to pollution and climate change was more effective at inducing transepithelial permeability and ROS production in cultured airway epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>]. This DEPs ability seems to be strongly dependent on a range of variables. However, the latest scientific findings indicate that DEPs are likely involved in exacerbations of already existing disease processes, and not in the development of new diseases. The latter hypothesis is based on the enhancement of Th2-dependent responses induced by DEPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Nonetheless, there are a variety of mechanisms involved in exposure to asthma triggers that do not depend on IgE-mediated responses. These observations have been partially confirmed by epigenetic studies. Epigenetics refers to changes in gene expression that are not caused by alterations in DNA sequences; these changes can be associated with environmental factors such road traffic and smoke pollution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>]. With regard to this issue, recent studies have been focused on mutation hotspots and DNA methylation, involving the so called CpG islands, which are located near the promoter region of many genes. In particular, one of these studies showed significant differences in methylation levels of CpG islands in eosinophils from asthmatic patients compared with non-asthmatic individuals, with the lowest levels of methylation in the subjects with asthma. This study also showed significant associations between IgE and low methylation at 36 loci concentrated in CpG islands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>]. In addition to the above, changes in histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase activity have been observed in cells from patients with lung disorders such as severe asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Considering that the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are dependent on histone deacetylase activity, this finding may be relevant for patients with severe asthma and COPD who are insensitive to glucocorticoid therapy. Indeed, it has been shown that glucocorticoid-insensitive asthmatics have an increased activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which can reduce the ligand-binding affinity of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) leading to impaired corticosteroid sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. This can contribute to poor disease control in patients with chronic asthma and COPD. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that also disruption of circadian rhythms may impair asthma control. For example, the degree of asthma control has been shown to strongly correlate with sleep quality. In fact, individuals whose asthma is not well controlled take longer to fall asleep, awake more often, and spend more time awake during the night compared to those with well controlled asthma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. Interestingly, many other immunological and allergic diseases, including allergic rhinitis, atopic eczema, chronic urticaria, and rheumatoid arthritis, show a circadian rhythm in the intensity of symptoms and disease severity, which suggests the importance of chronotherapy as a strategy to achieve symptoms control [
