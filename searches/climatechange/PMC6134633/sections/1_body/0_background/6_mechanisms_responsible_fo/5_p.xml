<p id="Par23" class="p">Further evidence of an association between air pollution and mortality in the elderly was provided by another study, which showed that a 3–4% increase in daily deaths for all causes and for cardiovascular disease in the elderly was associated with an increase in fine particulate matter and sulfur dioxide from the 10th to the 90th percentile [

Cardiovascular deaths were also associated with levels of carbon monoxide (4% increase in daily deaths). On the contrary, the associations between air pollution and mortality were not statistically significant in children under 5 years. In summary, there was a significant trend of increased risk of death based on age, with effects more evident for individuals over 65 years old. The effect of air pollution was even larger in areas with higher socioeconomic level [
