<p id="Par22" class="p">The relationship between short-term exposure to air pollution and cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality in the elderly is well-documented. A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted by Bell et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">53</xref>] found strong, consistent evidence of a higher risk of PM-associated hospitalisation and death in the elderly. The results of this meta-analysis showed that a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 exposure was associated with a higher risk of death of 0.64% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50, 0.78) for older populations compared with 0.34% (95% CI 0.25, 0.42) for younger populations. In another systematic review by Bell et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>], regarding sensitivity to mortality or hospital admission from short-term ozone exposure, mortality risk was also higher for older persons (1.27%; 95% CI 0.76–1.78) than for younger persons (0.60%; 95% CI 0.40–0.80).
