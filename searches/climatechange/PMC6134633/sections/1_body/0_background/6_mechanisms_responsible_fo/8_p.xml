<p id="Par26" class="p">Environmental pollution exposure significantly increases the risk of respiratory diseases, particularly asthma. Both adult and young patients, smokers or non-smokers, are prone to acute asthma attacks as a result of greater exposure to air pollution. In particular, children from low-income backgrounds have been found to be more susceptible to acute asthma attacks due to air pollution. However, larger studies are required to confirm the relevance of these interactions, and to further explore the risk factors for asthma associated with long-term air pollution exposure in patients of different ages. Moreover, when differentiating between the effects of various risk factors, it is important to remember that asthma is not a single disease [
