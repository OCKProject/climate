<p id="Par28" class="p">Other mechanisms involved in climate change include air temperature increases in urban areas, a phenomenon called “heat island.” This effect is particularly relevant for people living in these areas, especially those who are affected by cardiovascular and/or respiratory diseases. It also has a significant impact on the most fragile population groups (e.g., elderly and poor people). In fact, these people have less access to air conditioning and tend to stay more outdoors (e.g., streets, squares) where they are more exposed to urban overheating. In addition, exposure to outdoor air pollution combined with exposure to allergenic pollen can trigger severe asthma attacks. A reduction in emergency hospital admissions after the implementation of prevention programs supports the view of a causal link between air pollution and exacerbations of chronic respiratory diseases [
