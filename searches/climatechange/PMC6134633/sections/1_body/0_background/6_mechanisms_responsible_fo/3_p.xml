<p id="Par21" class="p">Epidemiological studies indicate that older people are at higher risk of hospitalisation. In particular, increased exposure to air pollution has been linked to increased mortality, hospital admissions and emergency-room visits in the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. These effects are mainly due to exacerbations of chronic diseases or to respiratory tract infections (e.g., pneumonia), and may be modulated by ambient temperature as demonstrated by several studies showing that the elderly are particularly vulnerable to heat waves. In general, it seems that elderly subjects are more vulnerable to PM than to other pollutants, with greater effects on cardiorespiratory mortality and acute hospital admissions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51" class="xref">51</xref>]. The elderly are at greater risk than other age groups due to their enhanced susceptibility to air pollutants as a result of normal and pathological ageing and related processes. In fact, ageing has been associated with a decline in immune defences and respiratory function, resulting in a higher predisposition to respiratory infections. Moreover, among the chronic diseases that affect the elderly population, COPD and asthma can accelerate pulmonary function decline and increase the risk of mortality [
