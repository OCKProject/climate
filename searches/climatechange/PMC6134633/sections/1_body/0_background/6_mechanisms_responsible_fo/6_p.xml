Also, the elderly and non-married people had higher risks of mortality during days with extreme dust events. People aged 65 years and older had a 4.4% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 5.3% higher risk of cardiorespiratory mortality compared with those who were under the age of 65. People who were not married had a 4.1% higher risk of all-cause mortality and a 4.7% higher risk of cardiorespiratory mortality than those married [
