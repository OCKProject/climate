<p id="Par33" class="p">The effects of global warming on human health are supported by many official documents which emphasize the importance of air pollution on the rising incidence of many respiratory diseases. Climate change, by modifying major climatic variables, influences directly and indirectly the formation of air pollutants. Both global warming and solar radiation contribute to the formation of secondary pollutants in the atmosphere, especially tropospheric ozone. All these factors can explain, at least partly, the increasing incidence of respiratory and allergic diseases in different parts of the world. Recent forecasts suggest that climate change will persist for several decades (IPCC 2013). It is likely that we will face the impact of climate change for at least the next 50Â years. The effects of climate change are already here and their negative consequences cannot be easily avoided or prevented. In many patients with respiratory diseases like asthma, symptomatic treatment with bronchodilators or inhaled corticosteroids is sufficient to control disease. However, there are patients who do not achieve control despite treatment with the best current therapy. This heterogeneity of asthma and allergic diseases is increasingly appreciated based primarily on recent cluster analyses, molecular phenotyping, biomarkers and differential responses to targeted and non-targeted therapies [

A joint effort among scientists of different disciplines together with public administrations is highly desirable to limit present and future harm to human health as a result of interaction between climate change and air pollution.
