<p class="p">This study analysed the rainfall and temperature changes during the rice and wheat growing periods, and resultant impacts on rice and wheat production and their irrigation requirements in the Gomti River basin in India. For simulation of crop production as well as basin hydrology, SWAT hydrological model was used. The MIROC (3.2, HiRes) GCM projections for A1b, B1 and A2 emission scenario were used for generation of climate change for future time periods of 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. The SWAT model performed reasonably well for the simulation of streamflow and also for the simulation of rice and wheat yield during the calibration and validation periods. This modelling study revealed increase in mean rainfall during rice growing season (
 <italic class="italic">Kharif</italic>) in the range of 7.3–17.8, 9.9–14 and 20.9–33.2 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. However, during wheat growing season rainfall was projected to decrease in the range of 5.1–26.4, 1.9–15.4 and 7.6–16.7 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The simulation results showed increase in rice and wheat yield in future periods under the MIROC3.2 GCM projected climate change scenarios, provided that other factors of crop growth are favorable. Considering the entire river basin, and the three emission scenarios (A1b, B1, and A2), mean rice yield is projected to increase by 5.5–6.7, 16.6–20.2 and 26–33.4 % during the time period 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively and the mean wheat yield is likely to increase by 13.9–15.4, 23.6–25.6 and 25.2–27.9 % for the same future period. Simulation results also showed increase in irrigation water allocation for wheat in the range of 17–28, 28.3–36.5 and 38.4–45.3 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. In contrast, irrigation water allocation for rice was simulated to decrease, though this decrease remained &lt;5 % during the same future time periods. These results indicates the need to improve its irrigation facilities in the basin to cope up with the decreasing rainfall for the growing of
