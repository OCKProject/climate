<p class="p">Similar to rice, there is also increase in the wheat yield in the basin, with higher increase during 2080s as compared to 2020s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). However, increase in yield under the different emission scenarios remained almost the same. Further, HRUs wise analysis showed large variation (1645–4026.9 kg/ha) in the yields of different HRUs depending upon the emission scenarios and future periods (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b). The median yield of wheat in the basin varied from 2685.4 to 2704.2, 2899.0 to 2946.8 and 2940.9 to 3013.8 kg/ha during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively depending upon the different emission scenarios. The baseline period median yield was 2386.8 kg/ha. The increase in mean wheat yield in the basin varied in the range of 13.9–15.4, 23.6–25.6 and 25.2–27.9 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. As opposed to rice, increase wheat yield was higher at the downstream basin as compared to the upstream basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>b). At downstream areas of the basin, increase in wheat yield varied from 16–17.6, 28.0–31.4 and 30.8–33.6 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Wheat yield at upstream increased from 9.4–11.5, 14.9–15.6 and 15.3–17.7 %, during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. In this study, wheat was irrigated using the shallow aquifer water. The decrease in rainfall in the month of December, February and March–May not trigger a decrease in wheat yield as irrigation water is available from the shallow water aquifer. However, the wheat yield increase in the basin was not significant (9–20 %) and CV of wheat yield also varied from 19 to 32 %, whereas CV of rice varied only from 14 to 17 %.
