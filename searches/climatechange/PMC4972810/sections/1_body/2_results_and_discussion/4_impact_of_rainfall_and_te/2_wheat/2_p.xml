<p class="p">Ortiz et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2008</xref>) reported that global warming may be beneficial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. The projected absolute mean temperature during wheat growing stage was not significantly higher as compared to the model default

 </sub> for wheat, which are 0 and 18 °C, respectively. Similar to rice, for wheat growing season also increase in number of days with daily maximum temperature greater than wheat optimum temperature (i.e., 18 °C), were not considerable in any of the future scenarios in the basin. Number of days with

  <italic class="italic">max</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 18 °C during wheat growing season ranged between 152 and 154 days during future periods as against 150 days during baseline period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Temperatures greater than 34 °C have been found to decrease wheat yields up to 50 % due to increased leaf senescence (Asseng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, in this study, MIROC temperature projection did not demonstrate greater temperature such as 34 °C even during 2080s for  wheat cropping season. Therefore, the projected increase in maximum temperature may not affect the growth and yield of wheat in the basin. In addition, simulated increase in yield gain might be due to increased rate of irrigation water application (as discussed below). Lv et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported increase in irrigated wheat yields in almost all regions China under full irrigation conditions. Similar to rice, Mishra et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>) also reported increase in wheat yield using DSSAT model and HadRM3 projected climate change scenarios in lower Ganga basin. But, they reported contrasting results for upper Ganga basin, where wheat yield was projected to decrease with REMO based projections. Based on the simulations studies for northern India [Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP)] to monitor rates of wheat senescence following exposure to temperatures greater than 34 °C with two commonly used process-based crop models (CERES-Wheat and APSIM), Lobell and Gourdji (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2012</xref>) indicated that existing models underestimate the effects of heat on senescence. Porter and Gawith (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">1999</xref>) also suggested explicit consideration of extreme high temperature events to better understand the full response range of growth and development processes for wheat as extreme high temperature events have autonomous effects on grain production. As the simulated climate change impact varies across models due to differences in model structure and its parameterization (Asseng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2013</xref>) and climate change scenarios used, multi-model ensemble analysis may be helpful for better quantification of climate change impact on crop yield and preparing adaptation plans.
