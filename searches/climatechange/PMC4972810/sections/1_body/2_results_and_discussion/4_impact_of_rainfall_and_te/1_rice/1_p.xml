<p class="p">The cumulative distribution function plotted using the 30 years simulated rice yield data, clearly indicates an increase in rice yield under the changing climate scenarios for the all the three future periods (2020s, 2050s, and 2080s), with comparatively greater increase during 2080s as compared to 2050s and 2020s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). During 2020s, there is marginal increase in yield and the increase in yield remained almost same for all the three emission scenarios. Further, analysis of HRU wise simulation results indicated large variations (1162.5–3401.5 kg/ha) in the simulated yields amongst different HRUs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>a) under different climate change scenarios. The median yield in the basin under different climate change scenarios ranged from 2077.8 (B1) to 2086.2 kg/ha (A2), 2286.6 (A2) to 2363.5 kg/ha (A1B), and 2503.5 (B1) to 2567.2 (kg/ha) (A2) during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, as compared baseline median yield of 1965.4 kg/ha. The large variation yield in different HRUs within basin is mainly due to different soil characteristics, input use and management practices etc. Overall, change in the mean rice yield in the basin varied from 5.5 to 6.7, 16.6 to 20.2 and 26.0 to 33.4 %, during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a). It is also to be noted that increase in yield is slightly higher at the upstream basin as compared to the downstream basin. At the upstream basin the increase in rice yield ranged from 6.6 to 8.7, 18.8 to 23.5 and 29.4 to 38.1 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, whereas at the downstream basin the increase in rice yield ranged from 5.1 to 6.0, 15.1 to 19.0 and 24.7 to 31.7 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Relatively higher increase in yield at the upstream basin may be attributed to the higher rainfall at the upstream basin (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). As we assumed that Sardha Sahayak canal supplies irrigation water without any limitation even in future time and rainfall is likely to be substantially increasing during future time periods over the rice growing season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), water stresses may not limit the paddy growth and development. The higher increase in rice yield towards the end of the century may be attributed to higher increase of rainfall during the end of the century (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>a).
