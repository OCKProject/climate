<p class="p">Matthews et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">1995</xref>) reported a reduction in rice yield of about 5 % per degree rise in mean temperature above 32 °C. Krishnan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2007</xref>) predicted average rice yield changes of −7.20 and −6.66 % with every 1 °C increase in temperature at the current level (380 ppm) of CO

They also reported a maximum gain of 11.08 % at Jorhat, where the climate is warm moist perhumid type had the maximum temperature of about 28 °C and a minimum temperature of 19 °C only as the temperature at the time of flowering affects the spikelet fertility and hence the yield. In our study basin, number of days with

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Analysis of the mean number of days with maximum temperature (

 </sub>) greater than 30 °C during the rice growing season indicated that that the number of days with 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">max</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 30 °C ranged from 95 to 99 days in the basin during future periods as against baseline of 93 days (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>). Temperature changes during the rice growing period were not significantly high in the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The optimum temperature for the normal development of rice ranges from 27 to 32 °C (Yin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">1996</xref>; Shah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2011</xref>). The projected mean temperatures in the basin during July–Oct ranged from 26.5 to 30, 27.6 to 30.7 and 28.1 to 31.5 °C, respectively, which is within the optimum range (Yin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">1996</xref>; Shah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2011</xref>) in most of the cases. Thus, temperature changes may not affect the growth and yield of paddy. As there is not considerable increase in number of days with

 </sub> &gt; 30 °C when compared to the baseline period, future maximum temperature may not affect the rice production considerably in the Gomti river basin. It has also been reported that changes in the minimum temperature is more crucial than a change in the maximum temperature for rice with decline in rice yield by 10 % for each 1 °C increase in the minimum temperature above 32 °C (Pathak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, MIROC projected maximum values for minimum temperature during the rice sensitive growing months were 26.04, 26.94 and 28.43 °C, for 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. Therefore, rice yield may not be negatively affected with these projected changes of temperature. Further, Saseendrain et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">2000</xref>) reported an exponential increase in rice yield due to increase in rainfall above the observed values. Increase in temperature mostly remaining within the optimum limit as compared to the baseline together with the projected increase in rainfall under all three emission scenarios for all the three future periods in the basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) probably contributed to the gain in the rice yield. In SWAT all stresses including water stress integrates together and influence on the growth and yield. Therefore, the positive effects of water in rice growth and development might outweigh the stress due to higher temperature. Simulation studies conducted using different models and scenarios have projected decrease in rice yield in India as well as Indo-Gangetic basin too (Naresh Kumar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>; Mishra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>). The differences in results may be attributed to the different crop growth simulation models used as well as climate change scenarios used. For example, Mishra et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>) based on DSSAT model simulation reported a greater decrease (4.7–23.8) when REMO projected climate change scenario were used. They reported a change in the rice yield in the range 1.2 (lower IGB) to −5.9 % (upper IGB) under the HadRM3 projected climate change scenarios, respectively.
