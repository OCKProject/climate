<p class="p">Simulated rice and wheat yield were compared with the reported yields of different districts located within the basin. According to 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test statistics (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) and PBIAS (&lt;10 %) evaluation statistics, SWAT model performed reasonably well in all the four districts in simulating the rice yield during calibration period (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Further, model performed reasonably well during validation phase except at Jaunpur district where PBIAS &gt; 10 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>) and Lucknow where 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test value is &lt;0.05. Similarly, mean wheat yield was also simulated reasonably well by the model in both calibration and validation phases as far as 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> test values are concerned. However, PBIAS was slightly higher than 10 at calibration phase in Lucknow, and during validation phase in Lucknow, Barabanki and Sultanpur (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). The over estimation (rice: 0.005–0.85 t/ha and wheat: 0.04–1.5 t/ha) and underestimation (rice: 0.01–0.48 t/ha and wheat: 0.065–1.74 t/ha) of rice and wheat yield during some years of calibration and validation periods could be attributed to different management practices followed e.g., tillage operations, crop rotations, depth and frequency of water application and planting dates etc. in different districts. However, SWAT could simulate the long term average yield quite well as shown in the mean statistics (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Since long term (30 years) mean yield for future as well as baseline period were used for climate change impact studies, the performance of the SWAT model in simulating mean yield may be considered as quite satisfactory.
