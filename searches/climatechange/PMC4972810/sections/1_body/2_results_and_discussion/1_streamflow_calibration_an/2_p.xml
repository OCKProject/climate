<p class="p">According to the performance rating suggested by Moriasi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2007</xref>), model performance was good (0.65 &lt; NSE ≤ 0.75; 0.5 &lt; RSR ≤ 0.6; and ±10 &lt; |PBIAS| ≤ ±15) during both calibration and validation phase at Neemsar and Sultanpur, and during calibration phase at Maighat. The model performance was found to be satisfactory (0.5 &lt; NSE ≤ 0.65; 0.6 &lt; RSR ≤ 0.7; and ±15 &lt; |PBIAS| ≤ ±25) during the both calibration and during validation phase at Jaunpur, and during validation phase at Maighat gauging station. The statistical indicators of the Maighat gauging station, which is located at the downstream end of the basin and reflecting the outflow from the entire basin, indicates that model performance is good at the calibration phase but satisfactory at the validation phase. Based on threshold

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2010</xref>) categorized model performance for monthly streamflow as excellent (≥0.90), very good (0.75–0.89), good (0.50–0.74), fair (0.25–0.49), poor (0–0.24), and unsatisfactory (&lt;0). According to these criteria, SWAT model performed reasonably well in simulating the streamflow for the entire Gomti basin with R

Overall, the SWAT model exhibits satisfactory performance in simulating monthly streamflows for the entire Gomti River basin as this study used observed streamflow of four spatially distributed gauging stations and long term records which cover both dry and wet years.
