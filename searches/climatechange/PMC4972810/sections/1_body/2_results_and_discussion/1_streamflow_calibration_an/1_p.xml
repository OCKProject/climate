<p class="p">Streamflow at the four gauging stations were calibrated and validated for the most sensitive parameters by matching measured and simulated streamflow of the four gauging stations located in the basin. The most sensitive factors considered for calibration and validation are: Base flow alpha factor (ALPHA_BF), available water capacity (SOL_AWC), plant uptake compensation factor (EPCO), delay of time for aquifer recharge (GW_DELAY), aquifer percolation coefficient (RCHRG_Dp), groundwater ‘revap’ coefficient (GW_REVAP), soil evaporation compensation factor (ESCO), curve number (CN2), threshold water depth in the shallow aquifer for flow (GWQMIN), threshold water level in shallow aquifer for revap (REVAPMIN), saturated hydraulic conductivity (SOL_K), Manning’s “n” value for overland flow (OV_N), maximum canopy storage (CANMAX), channel effective hydraulic conductivity (CH_K2), bulk density (SOL_BD). During calibration period, the performance indicators
