<p class="p">SWAT simulation showed increase in mean actual evapotranspiration for both wheat and rice as compared to the baseline (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). However, the increase in actual evapotranspiration for wheat is higher than that of rice. The increase in evapotranspiration during rice growing period in the basin varied in the range of 3–3.35, 5–6.3 and 5.9–9.6 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively, with slightly higher increase in the upstream basin as compared to the downstream basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a).
