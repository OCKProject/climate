<p class="p">Increased rainfall during rice growing period resulted in the decreased irrigation water application for rice. As per the SWAT simulation results, irrigation could be decreased slightly in future for the rice cultivation in this basin. There was approximately 1–4 % (&lt;5 %) decrease in irrigation water application for rice during the future periods of 2020s and 2050s and 2080s. This decrease in irrigation water application is mainly due to increase in rainfall (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>a). The increase in rainfall in the basin during rice growing season varied in the range of 7.3–17.8, 9.9–24.0 and 20.9–33.2 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The increase in rainfall as well mean temperature is relatively higher at the upstream basins as compared to downstream basins during rice growing season.
