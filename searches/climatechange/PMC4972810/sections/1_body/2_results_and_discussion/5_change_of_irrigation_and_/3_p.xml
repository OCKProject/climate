<p class="p">As shown in the Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>, the increase in actual evapotranspiration during wheat season varied from 7.8–9.8, 10.8–11.8 and 10.1–16.3 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. The increased evapotranspiration demands resulted in more irrigation demand. The irrigation water allocated by the model for wheat considerably increased during future period, whereas it slightly decreased during the same period for rice cultivation. The irrigation water allocated for wheat is likely to increase by 17.0–28.0, 28.3–36.5 and 38.4–45.3 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively under the projected climate change scenarios. Increased irrigation requirement relates with the decreased rainfall of December, February and March during which wheat is grown, and higher temperature which resulted in increased actual evapotranspiration. Seasonal decrease in rainfall varied in the range of 5.1–26.4, 1.9–15.4 and 7.6–16.7 % during 2020s, 2050s and 2080s, respectively. This decrease in rainfall during wheat growing season is more in downstream basins as compared to upstream basin; whereas increase in temperature is higher at upstream basins as compared to downstream basins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). Greater increase in mean temperature at the upstream basin as compared to the downstream basin, might have greater impact on wheat yield in the upstream basin resulting in higher increase in downstream wheat yield than upstream wheat yield. The increased irrigation water allocation might have compensated for the temperature and other stresses, and resulting in increase in wheat production in the basin.
