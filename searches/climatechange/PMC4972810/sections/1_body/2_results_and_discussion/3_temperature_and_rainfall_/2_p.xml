<p class="p">As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, there is increase in rainfall in the basin during most of the months. The changes in the mean monthly rainfall in the basin varied in the range of −38.1 (Dec) to 91.5 (May), −48.8 (Nov) to 112.7 (May), and −45.8 (Nov) to 103.6 % (May) during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080, respectively, depending upon the different emission scenarios. During the rice growing period (June–October), there is increase in rainfall under all three emission scenarios for all the three future periods in most of the months, except for the month of August in which there is decrease in rainfall under the A2 emission scenario during 2020s and 2050s (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This decrease in rainfall during August is 13 and 4 % during 2020s and 2050s, respectively. Mean rainfall changes during the wheat growing months are different during different month and also under different emission scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Overall, month of December, February, March and April showed a decrease in mean rainfall during all the three future period for most of the emission scenarios. In the month of January, rainfall is likely to increase during 2080s for all emission scenarios in the entire basin. This decrease in rainfall during wheat growing season is likely to impact the yield as well as irrigation water demand.
