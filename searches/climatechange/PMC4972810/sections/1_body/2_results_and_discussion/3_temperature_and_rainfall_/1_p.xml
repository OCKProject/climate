<p class="p">Mean temperature changes in the basin varied from 0.02 to 1.56, 0.47–2.60, and 1.21–4.10 °C during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively under different emission scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). During the rice growing months (June–October), the changes in mean temperature varied from 0.02 to 0.77, 0.46 to 1.66, and 1.21 to 3.34 °C during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively, depending upon the different emission scenarios. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, the mean temperature changes during wheat growing season (November–April) were higher than the projected temperature change for rice growing season. It varied from 0.58 to 1.56, 1.23 to 2.60 and 1.96 to 3.98 °C, during 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s, respectively.
