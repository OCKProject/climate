<p class="p">The SWAT model considers daily mean temperature for simulating temperature stress on crop growth and yield. For the simulation of rice and wheat we gave approximately the same date of management operation such as planting and harvesting for all HRUs due to non- availability of HRU wise data of crop wise management practices. This may not be the actual case in the entire Gomti River basin. Moreover, we considered the changes in temperature and rainfall only for the future climate change scenarios. Other factors such as radiation may affect the future rice and wheat growth and yield. In addition, the agronomic practices, technological development, land use and land cover and cropping pattern were also assumed to remain same in future. However, this simulation study provided valuable information on possible impact of climate change on rice and wheat production, irrigation requirement and change of evapotranspiration which may be useful in future planning for crop production in the Gomti River basin.</p>
