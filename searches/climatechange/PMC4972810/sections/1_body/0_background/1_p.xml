<p class="p">Global food security threatened by climate change is one of the serious challenges in the twenty-first century to supply sufficient food for the burgeoning population while sustaining the already stressed environment. Changes in temperature and precipitation due to global climate change may have serious impacts on hydrologic processes, water resources availability, irrigation water demand, and thereby affecting the agricultural production and productivity. Meanwhile, climate variability is one of the most significant factors influencing year to year crop production, even in high yielding and high-technology agricultural areas (Kang et al.
