<p class="p">Various studies conducted to study the effects of climate change on the crop production showed that the effect of climate change on crop production varied with the climate change scenario used, current climate, cropping systems, management practices and also from region to region (e.g., Islam et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported decrease in irrigated rice yields in India by about 4, 7, and 10 % during the 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069), and 2080s (2070–2099), respectively. Rainfed rice yields in India were projected to decrease by about 6 % during the 2020s scenario, but during the 2050s and 2080s decrease was projected to be marginal (&lt;2.5 %). Naresh Kumar et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>) reported 6–23 and 15–25 % reduction in the wheat yield in India during 2050s and 2080s, respectively, under projected climate change scenarios. Mishra et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2013</xref>) reported a change in the rice yield in the range of −4.7 [lower Indo-Gangetic Basin (IGB)] to −23.8 (upper IGB) and 1.2 (lower IGB) to −5.9 % (upper IGB) under the REMO and HadRM3 projected climate change scenarios, respectively. They also reported a change in wheat yield in the range of −1.7 (lower IGB) to −12.9 (upper IGB) and 5.4 (lower IGB) to −6.1 % (upper IGB) under REMO and HadRM3 projected scenarios, respectively. These results indicate need for region specific studies for developing proper adaptation strategies.
