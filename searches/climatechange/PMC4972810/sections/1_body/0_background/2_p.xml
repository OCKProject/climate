<p class="p">Agricultural productivity is sensitive to climate change due to direct effects of changes in temperature, precipitation and carbon dioxide concentrations, and also due to indirect effects through changes in soil moisture and the distribution and frequency of infestation by pests and diseases (Mendelsohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2014</xref>). The increase in temperature under climate change scenarios is expected to increase the evapotranspiration (ET) demand. Therefore, understanding the impacts of climate change on crop production and water resources is of utmost importance for developing possible adaptation strategies.
