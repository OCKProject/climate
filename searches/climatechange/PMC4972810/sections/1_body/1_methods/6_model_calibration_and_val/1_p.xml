<p class="p">The SWAT model was calibrated and validated for the streamflow at four spatially distributed gauging stations, Neemsar, Sultanpur, Jaunpur and Maighat (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) based on the monthly streamflow data obtained from Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, Government of India. Eight years warm-up period (1982–1990) was considered prior to the model simulation starting date to stabilize the model initial condition. Before calibration and validation, a sensitivity analysis was performed using SUFI2 in SWAT CUP auto calibration tool (version 5.1.7) (Abbaspour

 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec" class="xref">Rice and wheat yield calibration and validation</xref>”) final adjustments for the hydrological parameters were done by matching observed and simulated streamflow data of four different gauging stations. The model was calibrated using the data for 1990–2000 for all the four gauging stations. The model validation was done using 2001–2008 data for all the gauging stations, except for Maighat station where data for the period 2001–2006 was used for model validation. The Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), coefficient of determination (
