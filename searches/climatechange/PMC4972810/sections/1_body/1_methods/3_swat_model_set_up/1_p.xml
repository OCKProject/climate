<p class="p">For SWAT simulation, the basin, sub basins and stream network were delineated from the 90 m × 90 m shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) (Jarvis et al.

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a) at the SWAT watershed delineation process and sub-basin discretization for spatial aggregation, and was further divided into 296 HRUs at HRU definition and analysis. The soil types of the study area were extracted from a soil map (78 × 78 m resolution) of the Ganga River basin (

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Soils of the area were predominantly alluvial, deep soil. Soil properties were also taken from the same NBSS&amp;LUP soil map. For land use and land cover data, the satellite remote sensing derived International Water Management Institute (IWMI) land-cover map (Thenkabail et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" class="xref">2009</xref>) of the study area at 56 × 56 m resolution was used. The predominant land use in the basin was agriculture, with 59.4 % of the area occupying irrigated conjunctive use double cropping (SWAT model class, R-08), and 32.7 % area occupying irrigated surface water, double cropping (R-02) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). Other land use categories were forests (2.6 %), irrigated surface water continuous crop lands (1.3 %—R03), barren lands (1.1 %) etc. Climate data required by the model are daily precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity. Historical daily precipitation and air temperatures of 14 districts (Barabankki, Hardoi, Kheri, Lucknow, Pilibhit, Shahjahanpur, Sitapur, Unnao, Udham Singh Nagar, Faizabad, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Sultanpur, and Jaunpur) covering the entire basin for the period 1982–2010 were obtained from the National Initiative on Climate Resilient Agriculture web portal (NICRA,

Daily values of solar radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity were generated using long term statistics through the WXGEN weather generator (Sharpley and Williams
