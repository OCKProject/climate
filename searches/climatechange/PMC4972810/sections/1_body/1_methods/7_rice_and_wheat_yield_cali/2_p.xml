<p class="p">The model was calibrated for rice using the yield data for the period 1995–2002 and validated using the data for the period 2003–2008. Similarly, calibration of the model for wheat was done using the yield data for 1996, 1998–2003, and data for 2004–2009 periods were used for model validation. Reported rice and wheat yield data of four districts (Lucknow, Sultanpur, Barabanki, and Jaunpur) in the basin, collected from the State Department of Agriculture, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, were used for calibration and validation of the model. Area weighted average simulated yield of each HRUs in relevant districts were compared with the reported district average yield for calibration and validation of SWAT model. The differences between the measured and simulated yields were evaluated by using
