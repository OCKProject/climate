<p class="p">Annual yields of both rice and wheat were calibrated by manually adjusting the parameters such as harvest index (HVSTI), biomass energy ratio (BIO_E), Auto_NSTRS (nitrogen stress factor that triggers fertilization), Auto_WSTRS (water stress threshold that trigger irrigation), for both the crops. In addition to the above parameters, the planting and harvesting dates and heat unit to maturity for wheat and initial LAI and biomass for rice were also considered for calibrating the model.</p>
