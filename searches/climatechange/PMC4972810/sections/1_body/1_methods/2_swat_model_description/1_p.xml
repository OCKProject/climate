<p class="p">The SWAT model was developed for exploring the effects of climate and land management practices on water, sediment and agricultural chemical yields (Arnold et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">1998</xref>). This is a watershed scale model and simulates the hydrological cycle, plant growth cycles, transportation of sediment, and agricultural chemical yields on a daily time step. In SWAT, the watershed is divided into a number of sub-watersheds that are further subdivided into hydrologic response units (HRUs) based on unique soil, slope and land-use characteristics. The model simulates hydrology at each HRUs using the water balance equation. In present study, we used the latest version of SWAT (SWAT-2012.10_1.14) with ArcGIS (ver.10.1) interface.
