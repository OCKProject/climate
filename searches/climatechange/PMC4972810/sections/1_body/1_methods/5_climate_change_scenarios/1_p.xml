 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2007</xref>), were used to develop climate change scenarios. The MIROC3.2 model, developed at the National Institute for Environmental Studies of Japan, has been found to perform quite satisfactorily, with larger pattern correlation and smaller root-mean-square differences for India (Anandhi and Nanjundiah

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2012</xref>). Using the MIROC 3.2 (HiRes) monthly projection for three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) emission scenarios, namely A2 (high), A1B (medium) and B1 (low), daily rainfall and temperature time series were generated for three future periods of 2020s (2010–2039), 2050s (2040–2069), and 2080s (2070–2099). We used the most commonly used perturbation (or delta change) method (Hay et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2002</xref>; Khoi and Suetsugi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">2012</xref>) for generating the climate change scenarios. These perturbed rainfall and temperature data of 12 stations, spread over the basin, were input to the calibrated and validated SWAT model and model was run for the each emission scenarios and time periods separately. The results were analysed separately for each of the emission scenarios and time periods. The results in each case were expressed as cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) and as percentage change with respect to the baseline period.
