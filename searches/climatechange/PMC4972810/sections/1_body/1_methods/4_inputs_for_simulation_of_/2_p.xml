<p class="p">Paddy fields in the SWAT model are treated as a pothole, like an impounded or depression area. Impound operation was given before planting, and release operation was given 5 days before harvesting of paddy for each rice growing HRUs. Maximum volume of water stored in the pothole was fixed to 60 mm and the fraction of area that drains to pothole was initially set as 0.8. Moreover, at the initial stage of the modelling, initial leaf area index (LAI) and biomass of rice were set as 1.1 and 800 kg/ha, respectively as rice is mostly a transplanted crop (Kaur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, these values were lowered to 0.9–1 and 700–780 kg/ha, respectively while calibrating the model to match the observed and simulated rice yield of different districts.
