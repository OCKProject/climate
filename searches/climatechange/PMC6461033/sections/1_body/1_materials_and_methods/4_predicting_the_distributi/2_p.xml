<p class="p">In this study, we chose the near threatened, vulnerable, and endemic species
 <italic class="italic">: Eucommia ulmoides</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Liriodendron chinense, Phoebe bournei, Fagus longipetiolata, Amentotaxus argotaenia</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Cathaya argyrophylla</italic> from the threatened dark species based on available data and species’ distribution range: all species have a limited distribution and a small dataset of occurrence sites. In total, we found 187 occurrence sites for these species in relevant references, local flora, and the flora of China, which we included in the MaxEnt model (
 <italic class="italic">A. argotaenia:</italic> 30 sites
 <italic class="italic">, C. argyrophylla</italic>: 22 sites
 <italic class="italic">, E. ulmoides</italic>: 32 sites
 <italic class="italic">, L. chinense</italic>: 35 sites
 <italic class="italic">, F. longipetiolata</italic>: 29 sites
 <italic class="italic">, P. bournei</italic>: 39 sites) (

 <xref rid="table-1" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). According to the records of the references, geographic coordinate data are within an accuracy of about three km. The 19 bioclimatic variables were filtered out some less important ones by using RF model and removed a few high correlated variables by using correlation coefficient. The correlation coefficient was implemented in R ver. 3.3.1 (
