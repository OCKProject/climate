<p class="p">In our model, we split the dataset into two parts: 75% of the occurrence data were used as training set, while the remaining 25% was used as a test set to evaluate the strength of the model. In this model, we set the 10,000 points as the max number of background sampling entire China. As for the small size of our data, we tuned the regularization multipliers (0.1, 0.25, 0.35, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5, 1.75, 2, 2.25, 2.5, 2.75, and 3) in MaxEnt model, to find out the best one with the smallest corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc) value (

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and omission error (minimum training presence as the logistic threshold) was used to quantify the strength of the current scenario models. AUC values range from zero to one, with the values of ≤0.5 indicating that the model performs worse than a random model and values close to 1 indicating that the model performs better than a random model (
