<p class="p">The probability of occurrence varies among species, regions and depends on the frequencies of species in a particular assemblage. Each species was assigned an individual probability threshold, which was a quantile calculated from a user-defined probability. Based on the comparison of the dark diversity from different probabilities (1%, 5%, 10%) (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-2" class="xref">Table S2</xref>), to explore the broader possible species pool in China, it was defined 1% in all regions here. For each area, a species was included in the dark diversity when it was absent from a target region and its occurrence probability was higher than its threshold value.
