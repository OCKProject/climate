<p class="p">This study covered the entire area of China. We retrieved vascular plants occurrence data in each province and municipality of China from the Flora of China (
 <uri xlink:href="http://frps.eflora.cn/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://frps.eflora.cn/</uri>) and merged data of municipalities into their nearest provinces, so we got 27 records in total (

 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pärtel, Szava-Kovats &amp; Zobel (2011)</xref>, derived from a global map and at the scale of 100 x 100 km, although our data are at larger scale, the observed species lists are much more complete, especially for that of Northern China, which was considered difficult to access (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kier et al., 2005</xref>). We constructed an individual species dataset for them to show which plants were present or absent. Although the floristic data have been collected since 1959, we assume that they are still relevant because plants, particularly those in the temperate forest, respond relatively slowly to environmental changes (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Franklin et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Menéndez et al., 2006</xref>). We only included plant data at the species level, and we merged all subspecies. We also excluded all cultivated species that were not considered a natural part of the vegetation based on their life history and dispersal traits. Synonyms and conservation status such as threatened species were checked using The Plant List (
 <uri xlink:href="http://www.theplantlist.org/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.theplantlist.org/</uri>) and The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (
