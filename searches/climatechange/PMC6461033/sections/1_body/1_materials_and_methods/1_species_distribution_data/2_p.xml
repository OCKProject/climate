 <uri xlink:href="http://www.Worldclim.org/" class="uri" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">www.Worldclim.org/</uri>). As for the variables in 2050 and 2070, we selected those under representative concentration pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) and based on the CCSM4 global climate model (GLM). There are four RCPs, ranging from very high (RCP8.5, the temperature will increase to 3.7 ± 0.7 °C) through to deficient (RCP2.6, the temperature will rise to 1.0 ± 0.4 °C) future concentrations (

 <xref rid="ref-66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2018</xref>), in this study, we chose RCP4.5 scenario as the future climate scenario. In addition, according to the projection by 
 <xref rid="ref-65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ying (2012)</xref>, until the year of 2018, the CCSM4 has been showing as the more accurate model than the other 16 GLMs under RCP4.5 scenarios, so in this study, the future climate projections are based on the CCSM4 climate model. Current and future bioclimatic projection data were used in the MaxEnt model to predict habitat suitability of six threatened dark species that will be detailed in the following sections.
