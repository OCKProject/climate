<p class="p">We used RF to assess the contribution of bioclimatic variables toward the dark diversity. The RF technique estimates the importance of a predictive variable by evaluating the Out-of-bag (OOB) error increase (

In other words, the decrease of prediction accuracy, represented as the percentage of increased mean square error (% IncMSE) when OOB data for the specific variable is switched while all the other variables remained (

Here, we extracted a matrix of 3,844 spot records covering the whole area of China, with their 19 current bioclimatic data, and applied it to RF, where their dark diversity values at the regional level are treated as the response variable.
