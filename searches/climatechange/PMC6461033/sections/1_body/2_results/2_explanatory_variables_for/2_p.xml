<p class="p">Then according to the results of cross-correlation (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>), we selected seven bioclimatic variables used in the MaxEnt model for current climate scenario (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4" class="xref">Fig. S2</xref>), and the contribution of them differed between six species (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For these six species, BIO14 in current bioclimatic scenarios was the most important variable when projected their distribution, BIO5 also showed its significance to project the species distribution (
 <xref rid="table-2" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). For the 2050 and 2070 climate scenarios, we selected six bioclimatic variables used in MaxEnt (
