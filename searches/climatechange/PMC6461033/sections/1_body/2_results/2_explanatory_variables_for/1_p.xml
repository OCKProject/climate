<p class="p">The relative importance of the 19 bioclimatic variables regarding dark diversity in China, as assessed using RF, is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. We found that variables associated with temperature showed more importance than those associated with precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). However, together these variables only explained 71.72% of the variance, thus few unknown factors remain. The most important variables were Temperature annual range (BIO7) and Temperature seasonality (BIO4), Mean temperature of warmest quarter (BIO10), and Precipitation seasonality (BIO15). Other significant variables were Isothermality (BIO3), Mean temperature of wettest quarter (BIO8), Max temperature of warmest month (BIO5), Mean temperature of coldest quarter (BIO11), Mean temperature of driest quarter (BIO9), Precipitation of driest quarter (BIO17), Precipitation of coldest quarter (BIO19), Mean diurnal range (BIO2), and Precipitation of driest month (BIO14). These variables were filtered to use in MaxEnt projection firstly.
