<p class="p">At the same time, we have noticed that sometimes the results from two models may have a little contradiction, and we think the reason could be different types of data subject they were using or the different theories they were based on. For example, in our study, 
 <italic class="italic">F. longipetiolata</italic> is a dark species in Jiangsu province while MaxEnt showed low climatic suitability for it there (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). In addition, MaxEnt was only trained with climatic variables, but some other variables not covered in this study, such as anthropogenic activities, invasive species, atmospheric carbon dioxide, downward radiation, and evolutionary history may also affect the species distribution (

 <xref rid="ref-62" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Woodward &amp; Kelly, 2008</xref>). Moreover, as a present-background (present-only) based model, MaxEnt can only estimate the relative likelihood and probability, not probability of occurrence, which can be estimated with presence-absence and occupancy-detection models (

 <xref rid="ref-21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Guillera-Arroita et al., 2015</xref>), and this may explain the differences from the result of dark diversity. Moreover, the use of one climate model scenario maybe also a potential limitation.
