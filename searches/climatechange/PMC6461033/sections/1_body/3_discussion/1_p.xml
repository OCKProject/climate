<p class="p">Unlike most other studies to date, we estimated dark diversity using data at the provincial scale instead of at spatial grid (

 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ronk, Szava-Kovats &amp; Pärtel, 2015</xref>). We do consider that a provincial level study is rather coarse in terms of its spatial scales, but still, the results of this study provide the first ever dark diversity patterns concentrated in China. A more robust study can be carried out when data at finer scales become available. Moreover, our result showed a similar distribution compared with the previous global scale study, where data at spatial grid were applied (

 <xref rid="ref-12" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">De Bello et al. (2016)</xref>, they merged plot-level species lists into 18 habitats at a larger scale and produced habitat-level estimates of dark diversity estimates. They concluded that habitat-level analysis had a higher similarity with expert estimates than that in the grid (
