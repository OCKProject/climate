<p class="p">In this study, the results combination of dark diversity and Maxent helped six threatened species to find out their possibly suitable areas presently and in the future, and we believe it is valuable for ex situ conversation activities. Currently, the most common approach, that is, used in ex situ conservation is to collect rare species and grow them in plantations or resource nurseries and to maintain their seed banks (

In spite of that, this combination can be applied to research on species reintroduction, ecological restoration and preventing exotic invasion. For example, possibly suitable areas predication can reduce labor and financial costs and increase the success rate of reintroductions.
