<p class="p">To date, most research on dark diversity has been conducted in Europe (

 <xref rid="ref-51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ronk, Szava-Kovats &amp; PÃ¤rtel, 2015</xref>), and those studies have shown that dispersal limitation and stress-tolerance play essential roles in shaping the patterns of observed and dark diversity (
 <xref rid="ref-48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Riibak et al., 2015</xref>). However, the impacts of future climate change are largely unknown on shaping the patterns of observed and dark diversity in those studies. Furthermore, most studies have focused on mapping dark diversity at macro-scale and comparing methods to estimate dark diversity but ignored the specific information on the identity of species that constitute dark diversity. For example, questions such as whether the dark diversity dataset includes any threatened species and what would happen to their potential distribution with global climate change have not yet been answered.
