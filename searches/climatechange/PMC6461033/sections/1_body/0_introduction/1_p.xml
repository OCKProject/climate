<p class="p">Biodiversity is a fundamental and central topic in ecology and conservation. In recent years, ecologists have been increasingly investigating the effects of climate change on biodiversity and species’ distribution (

However, the observed species do not reflect the complete habitat-specific species pool of a site as some species will remain undetected due to limited sampling efforts and resources of the investigators and the timing of sampling (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pärtel, Szava-Kovats &amp; Zobel, 2011</xref>). For example, rare species and species with very short lifespan can be overlooked easily. That is especially true when sampling units are large in space and sparse in time. This particular set of species that belong to a particular species pool but are not locally present, or that are absent from a community but have the potential to establish are known as “dark diversity” (
