<p class="p">In this study, we tried to seperate threatened species from dark diversity pool and to explore how their distributions shift in the future in China using the species distribution model. We proposed three fundamental questions: (1) What is the level and distribution of dark diversity in China, and does the dark diversity include threatened species? (2) Which environmental variables affect dark species distributions the most? (3) Will the potential areas of dark (particularly threatened) plants remain suitable in the future under global climate change? To address these questions, we calculated the Beals probability index using previously complied vascular plants datasets at the macro-scale to investigate the level of dark diversity in China. We also used random forest (RF) model to assess the contribution of a number of variables to dark diversity. Lastly, we performed maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modeling to project changes in the distribution of threatened dark species under climate scenarios in the years of 2050 and 2070. The results of this study could provide novel information on dark diversity in China, as this has never been investigated before, to our best knowledge. Further, information on dark diversity at a regional scale could have significant implications on conservation efforts, including ecological restoration and invasion risk assessment.</p>
