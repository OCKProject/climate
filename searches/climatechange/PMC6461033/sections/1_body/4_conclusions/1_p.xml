Like other studies, we mapped the results of dark diversity in China, which shows that more and more plants could be potentially distributed and restored in the east of China. In spite of that, we combined the results of dark diversity and MaxEnt, and predicted the climatically suitable areas presently and in the future for six threatened species, which can be valuable for their conversation. This combination can also make a contribution to restoration efforts and invasion risk assessment of alien species.
