  <p class="p">These variable data were downloaded from WorldClim with 2.5-min. (of a longitude/latitude degree) spatial resolution (this is about 4.5 km at the equator). We obtained this dataset for current period from WorldClim 2.0, covering the period from 1960 to 1990. Those for 2050 were downloaded from WorldClim 1.4, referring the time span of 2041–2060. Data for 2070 were extracted from WorldClim 1.4, over the period of 2061–2080.</p>
