<p class="p">During autumn 2013, elevated temperature delayed bud set in both males and females (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). In autumn 2014, UVA treatment delayed bud set in males, but the combination of UVA and temperature (UVA+T) forced the buds to set earlier in males than in females (Table

 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>b). In the same year, removal of axillary buds resulted in delayed bud set in males under elevated temperature, relative to females (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>c). However, after bud removal, the combined treatment UVB+T forced the buds to set earlier in males compared to females. The combination treatment UVA+T also forced the bud break in males, to a smaller extent (Table
