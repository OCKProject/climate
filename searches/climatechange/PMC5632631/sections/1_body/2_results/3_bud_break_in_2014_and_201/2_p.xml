<p class="p">Bud break was forced under temperature treatments in both males and females in 2014 by 2 days (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a) and to a smaller degree in spring 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b). The significant negative coefficient of males showed that the female bud break was earlier than males, independent of treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33352-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). In 2015, when buds had been removed, elevated T and UVB slightly delayed bud break in males when compared to female clones (Table 
 <xref rid="ece33352-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). In contrast, the combination of temperature and UVA (UVA+T) enhanced bud break in males compared to female clones. (Table
