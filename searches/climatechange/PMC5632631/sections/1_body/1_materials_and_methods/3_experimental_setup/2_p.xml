<p class="p">The experimental setup included 36 plots in a 6 × 6 matrix, as explained in detail by Nybakken, Hörkkä, and Julkunen‐Tiitto (
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The plants within each plot received one of the following six treatments or treatment combinations: enhanced temperature (T), enhanced ultraviolet‐B radiation (UVB), ultraviolet‐A radiation (UVA), UVB+T, UVA+T, and control with ambient temperature and UV radiation (C). The enhanced levels of T and UVB were continuously regulated to increases of +2
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C and 30%, respectively. A 10 cm layer of 0.8% limed mineral soil was added to each plot. A distance of 3 m was kept between the plots in all directions, and adjustable aluminum frames (1.5 × 2.0 m) holding the lamps and heaters above the plots were bolted to metallic posts. A metal net fence of 1.5 m was constructed around the experimental field in order to prevent the intrusion of large mammals, and a protective metal sheet was implanted 60 cm into the soil, reaching 60 cm above the soil level, to prevent vole intrusion.
