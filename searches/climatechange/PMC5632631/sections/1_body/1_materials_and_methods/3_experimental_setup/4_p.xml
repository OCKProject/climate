<p class="p">Four Thies Clima sensors (Thies, Göttingen, Germany) were used for measuring UVB radiation. These sensors measured the radiation between 250 and 325 nm, with a peak of 300 nm. Two sensors were placed above the control frames for ambient UVB levels, and two under the frames of UVB enhancement plots for set‐point values. Temperature enhancement modulation was achieved using self‐made linear temperature sensors with four PT1000 probe elements fabricated with four connection cables. The set‐point values were achieved by placing two probe elements above the control frames and two under the temperature enhancement frames. Calculations of set‐point values and control of enhancement of the UV lamps and IR radiators were implemented by a modulator software (IPC100 configuration program and e‐console measuring and data‐saving program, Gantner Instruments GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). The whole system was in operation between 5 June 2013(day 156) and 13 September 2013 (day 256). In 2014, the treatment setup was in operation from 8 May (day 128) 2014 until 28 July (day 209) 2014. In 2015, the treatment system was not in operation at all. The ambient temperature data for the years 2013, 2014, and 2015 were procured from the meteorological weather station at Linnunlahti, Joensuu (&lt;200 m away from the experimental field). The photoperiod data were obtained from the sunrise‐and‐sunset.com website for Joensuu, Finland. As the photoperiod curves for 2013, 2014, and 2015 were overlapping and indistinguishable, only the 2013 photoperiod is included in the figure (Figure
