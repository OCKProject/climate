<p class="p">To each aluminum frame, six 40 W UV fluorescent lamps (1.2 m long, UVB‐313, Q‐Panel Co., Cleveland, OH, USA) were appended, following a cosine distribution (Björn, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>). The emission spectrum was measured with an Optronic OL‐756 portable UV‐VIS spectroradiometer (Optronic Laboratories, Orlando, FL, USA), while cellulose diacetate filters were wrapped around each lamp to debilitate radiation below 290 nm in the UVB treatment plots. The UVB plots received some additional UVA emitted by the UVB tubes. In six plots, the UV tubes were wrapped with polyester film in order to remove UVB, so that only the levels of UVA were achieved. The purpose of the UVA treatment was to provide control for UVB, as there were certain levels of UVA in the UVB plots. In the ambient UV plots, we hung un‐energized lamps in order to procure the same level of shading as in the enhanced plots. Two infrared (IR) heaters (CIR 110, FRICO, Partille, Sweden) were bolted along the middle axis of the aluminum frames for continuous temperature enhancement. In the ambient temperature plots, IR radiators were replaced with wooden boards in order to attain the same shading levels. The filters were changed every 3 weeks, and the frames were lifted every third week in order to maintain a 60 cm distance between the highest shoot tip and the radiators/UV lamps.
