<p class="p">The effects on bud break (2014, 2015) and bud set (2013, 2014) were analyzed using the cumulative link mixed model (clmm) in R (R Core Team, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) by applying the clmm function in Ordinal package (Christensen, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Two levels of temperature (ambient and enhanced), three levels of UV treatment (ambient, UVA, UVB), two levels of sex (male and female), and the day of year were set as fixed factors. Random factors were plot and clone identities. When more than one individual per clone and experimental plot were recorded, individual was nested within clone and plot. Along with these, interactions between sex, day, temperature, and UV treatments were also analyzed. For the analysis, only the time frame in which there were marked changes in bud stages was considered as follows: for bud break data from 2014—4 May–28 May (days 124–148), 2015 intact individuals—4 May–5 June (124–156), 2015 bud‐removed individuals—4 May–11 June (days 124–156) and in case of bud set data 2013—20 August–7 October (days 232–268), 2014 intact individuals—12 August–25 September (days 224–258) and 2014 bud‐removed individuals—12 August–25 September (days 224–258).
