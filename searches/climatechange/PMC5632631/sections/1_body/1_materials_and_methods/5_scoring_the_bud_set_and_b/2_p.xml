<p class="p">In 2013, the autumnal bud set was recorded from 20 August (day 232) until 19 October, 2013 (day 292) at 5‐day intervals, while the remaining three registrations were made at 2‐day intervals. In 2014, the registering of bud break took place from 22 April (day 112) to 25 June (day 176). Bud set for autumn 2014 was recorded from 12 August (day 224) to 7 October (day 280). In 2015 bud break scoring started on 4 May (day 124) and ended on 25 June (day 176). The scoring of bud set was based on Rohde et al. (

 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). The first stage includes apices between full, active growth to apices with an open bud (1), the second stage is a closed green bud (0.5), and the third a brown closed bud (0) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33352-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). In the case of bud break, the stages were defined as follows: a closed bud (0), closed bud with protruding green leaf tips (1), green leaf emerged from the bud with leaf bases hidden (2), broken bud with at least one visible petiole (3), and an unfolded leaf with visible leaf blade and stalk (4) (Figure
