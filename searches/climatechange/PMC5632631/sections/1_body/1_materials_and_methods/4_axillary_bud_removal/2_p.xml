<p class="p">In summer 2014 (2nd July) (day 183), three axillary buds from four lateral shoots were removed from one individual of every clone in each plot (total 410 individuals). In autumn 2014 (20th October) (day 293), another three buds were removed from the same individual in order to see whether the bud removal had any effect on bud set and bud break for the coming growing season.</p>
