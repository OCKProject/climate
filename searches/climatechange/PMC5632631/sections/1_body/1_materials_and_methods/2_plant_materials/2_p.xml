<p class="p">The aspen plantlets used in this experiment originated from Eastern and Southern Finland, as presented in Randriamanana, Nissinen, Moilanen, Nybakken, and Julkunen‐Tiitto (
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In 2012, when the field experiment started, they were micropropagated from buds of six male and six female aspen trees, about 30–40 years old. Each genotype was collected from the following locations: Kaavi 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>43′N, 28
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>42′E, Liperi 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>41′N, 29
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>33′E, Loppi 60
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>43′N, 24
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>27′E, Pieksämäki 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>18′N, 27
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>07′E, Polvijärvi 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>52′N, 29
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>19′E and 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>49′N, 29
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>20′E, and Kontiolahti 62
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>38′N, 29
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>41′E. Geographical distance was maintained in order to have the largest possible variation among the genotypes. The micropropagation was performed on a woody plant medium with 8.5 g/LAgar and 5 mg/L indole butyric acid. Fluorescent tubes (Gro‐Lux F36W, Havells Sylvania, Germany) of photon flux density 70‐μmol m

 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> at 400–750 nm were used to provide light at 23 ± 0.1
 <sup class="sup">°</sup>C temperature and 18 hr photoperiod in vitro.
