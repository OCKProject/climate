 <italic class="italic">Populus tremula</italic> is a diecious deciduous tree that is widely distributed throughout Europe and Asia. 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species are of great ecological importance, as a large number of organisms, including several endangered species, are found in association with these trees (e.g., Lindroth, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). They are, therefore, monitored in several national and international phenology networks. 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species are widely used as model organisms among woody plants in experimental botany (e.g., Bradshaw, Ceulemans, Davis, &amp; Stettler, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0009" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; DiFazio, Slavov, &amp; Joshi, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Numerous studies on climate change are conducted with different 
 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species as its circumboreal range largely overlaps with areas where drastic climate change is predicted to occur (IPCC

 <italic class="italic">Populus</italic> species had been found to show sex‐specific responses under different climatic stress factors (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Randriamanana et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). For example, Strømme et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) have shown that in young 
 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> plantlets, elevated temperature delayed bud set and forced bud break in one growing season old seedlings. However, in their studies, under combined UVB+T treatment, bud set was forced in both males and females while bud break was delayed only in males. Moreover, at low temperatures, females of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cathayana</italic> showed earlier growth cessation and more chilling injuries in the chloroplast ultrastructure, cellular membranes, and leaf morphology compared to males (Zhang, Jiang, Peng, Korpelainen, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Also, variations between sexes as to the magnitude of morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits have been documented under drought and elevated temperature in 
 <italic class="italic">P. cathayana</italic> (Xu, Peng, Wu, Korpelainen, &amp; Li, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0071" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Males of 
 <italic class="italic">P. cathayana</italic> having higher basal diameter, leaf nitrogen, and lower concentration of abscisic acid and UV‐absorbing compounds and exhibited greater resistance under enhanced UVB than did females (Xu et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
