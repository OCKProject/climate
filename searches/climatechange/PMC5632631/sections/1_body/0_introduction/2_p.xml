<p class="p">Global average surface temperatures have increased by 0.85°C over the period from 1880 to 2012 (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). As Earth's temperature rises, it becomes warmer earlier in the spring and stays warmer later into the fall at any location (Karl, Nicholls, &amp; Gregory, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>). This global warming could result in numerous changes in the nature. For instance, increase in temperature can affect the reproductive and dispersal potential of insects (Ayres &amp; Lombardero, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), and future climatic effects on plant phenology may change the availability of forage for dependent animal species (Mysterud, Yoccoz, Langvatn, Pettorelli, &amp; Stenseth, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0047" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Mismatches in timing between dependent animal species and plants may result in species outbreaks and/or extinctions. Plants are generally finely tuned to the seasonality of their environment. The autumn phenology of trees was traditionally thought to be mainly controlled by day length (Wareing, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0069" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1956</xref>), and spring phenology by temperature (Zohner, Benito, Svenning, &amp; Renner, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Recently conducted studies, however, have shown that rising temperatures influences the flushing dates of northern tree species (e.g., Chung et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Ibáñez et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Menzel, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). There are also signs of autumn phenology being affected by increase in temperature (Westergaard &amp; Eriksen 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0500" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1997</xref>, Kalcsits, Salim, &amp; Tanino, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Tanino, Kalcsits, Silim, Kendall, &amp; Gray, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Rohde, Bastien, &amp; Boerjan, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0061" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Hänninen &amp; Tanino, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Way, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The commencement of autumn leaf senescence and dormancy is based on a combination of numerous developmental and environmental signals (Cooke, Eriksson, &amp; Junttila, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Climate warming can accelerate the growth cessation in many tree species, cultivars, and ecotypes (Tanino et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). In some cases, the growth cessation occurs as a combination of low night temperatures and photoperiod. However, in some northern ecotypes of 
 <italic class="italic">Picea abies</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> Salix pentandra,</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Betula pubescens</italic> whose dormancy induction is insensitive to photoperiod, the autumn growth cessation is delayed due to the temperature increase resulting in longer growing seasons (Hänninen &amp; Tanino, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>).
