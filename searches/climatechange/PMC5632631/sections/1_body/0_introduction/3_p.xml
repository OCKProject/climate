<p class="p">The effects of climate factors on phenology have mostly been studied in growth chambers or in common gardens (e.g., Beuker,

 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>) while there are few outdoor studies with a specific experimental setup. The growth conditions used in almost all experiments indoors are temporarily and spatially less variable than those in natural environments (Frenkel, Jankanpaa, Moen, &amp; Jansson, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The temperatures are usually constant or at the best varying between diurnal values, while the light intensity is generally lower and with a spectral composition differing quite significantly from that of the sun (Leonidopoulos, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Young, McMahon, Rajapakse, &amp; Decoteau, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0073" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>). On the other hand, while in common garden experiments, phenology can be studied in natural light and temperature conditions, the local versus foreign effect cannot be tested rigorously (Allendorf &amp; Lundquist, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Thus, field experiments with experimentally modulated light and temperature supplementation are needed in order to gain a better understanding of the effects of climate factors on phenology.
