 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), except that we investigated the subsequent 2‐year effects of climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">P. tremula</italic> bud phenology, and the potential carry‐over effects for 1 year after the treatments were discontinued. In addition, the effect of axillary bud removal on the timing of bud set and bud break was tested. We hypothesized that (i) enhanced temperature will delay bud set and force bud break, while UVB will force bud set, and the responses will be mitigated by the experimental years due to acclimation, (ii) the effects of enhanced temperature on bud break will be sustained over the following season, even when the treatments are discontinued, (ii) bud removal will change the growing period due to resource restrictions, and (iv) males and females vary in their responses to the treatments.
