<p class="p">Growth and dormancy cycles in plants are also controlled by light quality (Olsen &amp; Lee, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Blue, red, and far‐red light influences the growth, dormancy, and bud formation of many plant species (e.g., Campbell et al.,

Most of the research on UVB and plants has concentrated on the effect of UVB as a stress factor. However, there is increasing evidence that UVB may also function as an environmental signal (Jenkins,
