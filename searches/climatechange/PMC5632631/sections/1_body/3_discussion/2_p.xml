<p class="p">In this study, we followed, to our knowledge, for the first time, the effects of temperature and UV on bud set and bud break in woody plant seedlings for three subsequent years. In line with our first hypothesis, and similar to the first year (Strømme et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0065" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), bud set was delayed by elevated temperature during the second year (autumn 2013). This confirms that temperature modifies sensitivity to day length signals at growth cessation and can influence the duration of bud formation in

 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Likewise, bud removal delayed bud set in males when compared to females. Bud removal can result in an overall reduction in sugar levels; sugars having a cross‐talk with the pathways of phytohormones also causing imbalances between them (Eyles et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Gibson, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0019" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>; Little &amp; Wareing, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1981</xref>). It is also found that sugars do play an important role in controlling bud dormancy by influencing the phytohormones (Anderson, Chao, &amp; Horvath, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>; Horvath, Anderson, Chao, &amp; Foley, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). High abscisic acid concentration is also associated with bud dormancy (Rinne, Tuominen, &amp; Junttila, 
 <xref rid="ece33352-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1994</xref>), and the removal of buds could lower the concentration of this hormone, leading to a delayed bud set in males under elevated temperature. The bud‐removed individuals in our experimental field showed increased height growth (Sobuj et al. unpublished data), and it has also been found that the increased height growth is genetically associated with delayed bud set in
