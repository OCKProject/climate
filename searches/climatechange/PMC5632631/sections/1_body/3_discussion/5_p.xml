<p class="p">After removal of axillary buds, males previously exposed to elevated temperature set their buds later than females. However, within plants previously exposed to UVB+T, only females had delayed bud set (autumn 2014) and also had earlier bud break (spring 2015) than males. This gender differences in bud phenology in response to UVB and temperature treatments are difficult to explain. In bud‐removed individuals, UVB might have also caused some fluctuations in the carbohydrate levels during the bud break causing a delay as explained by Lindroth, Hofman, Campbell, McNabb, and Hunt (

In fact, under UVB+T and before bud removal, males had bigger biomass than females (Nissinen et al., unpublished data). Thus, bud removal might have caused females to compensate for their relatively delayed growth when the treatments were discontinued.
