<p class="p">Contrary to our hypothesis, UVB did not affect bud break and bud set during the treatment period. In the first growing season (2012), UVB had a forcing effect on the bud break of male clones (Strømme et al. (

Increasing tolerance in plants to UVB over time is partly due to the production of UVB absorbing compounds that can reduce the transmittance of UV photons through leaf tissue (Jansen et al.,
