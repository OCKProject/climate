<p class="p">To sum up, elevated temperature was influential in delaying and forcing the bud formation and development. The effect of UV‐B diminished during the second growing season, but was again seen in bud‐removed individuals for bud break 2015. Males were more responsive compared to females, and the removal of invested resources (axillary buds) from the plants resulted in delay and forcing of autumn and spring bud phenology in males when compared to females. As the timing of bud break and bud set represents events in survival and growth, discernment of these mechanisms and their interactions with climatic variables is a key to understand the consequences of the projected climate change for
