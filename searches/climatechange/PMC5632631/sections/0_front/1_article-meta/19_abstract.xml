 <p class="p">Boreal tree species are excellent tools for studying tolerance to climate change. Bud phenology is a trait, which is highly sensitive to environmental fluctuations and thus useful for climate change investigations. However, experimental studies of bud phenology under simulated climate change outdoors are deficient. We conducted a multifactorial field experiment with single (T, 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVA</styled-content>,
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content"> UVB</styled-content>) and combined treatments (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVA</styled-content>+T, 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content>+T) of elevated temperature (T, +2°C) and ultraviolet‐B radiation (+30% 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content>) in order to examine their impact on both male and female genotypes of aspen (
  <italic class="italic">Populus tremula</italic> L.). This study focuses on the effect of the treatments in years 2 and 3 after planting (2013, 2014) and follows how bud phenology is adapting in year 4 (2015), when the treatments were discontinued. Moreover, the effect of bud removal was recorded. We found that elevated temperature played a key role in delaying bud set and forcing bud break in intact individuals, as well as slightly delaying bud break in bud‐removed individuals. 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content> delayed the bud break in bud‐removed males. In addition, both 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVA</styled-content> and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content> interacted with temperature in year 3 and even in year 4, when the treatments were off, but only in male individuals. Axillary bud removal forced both bud break and bud set under combined treatments (
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVA</styled-content>+T, 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content>+T) and delayed both under individual treatments (T, 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UVB</styled-content>). In conclusion, male aspens were more responsive to the treatments than females and that effect of elevated temperature and 
  <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">UV</styled-content> radiation on bud set and bud break of aspen is not disappearing over 4‐year study period.
