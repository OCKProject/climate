<p class="p">An adaptation to climate change strategies are actions taken by people in response to climatic stimuli which are meant to exploit associated beneficial opportunities. The adjustments can be categorised as either responses to current occurrences in climate or planned adaptation to long-term changes in climate (Hisali et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>). Adaptation allows for adjustments in a systemâ€™s behaviour and characteristics that enhance its ability to cope with external stresses. Given constant levels of hazard over time, adaptation allows a system to reduce the risk associated with these hazards by reducing its social vulnerability (Brooks &amp; Adger 
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>). Several lessons can be learnt from sociology and anthropological perspectives on human adaptation to climate change. Scientific studies in the disciplines of Anthropology and Sociology explored the mechanisms of adaptation to changing living conditions as a result of climate change (Brenkert &amp; Malone

 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2002</xref>). Gyampoh et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) observe that rural communities that are vulnerable to climate change have strong adaptive capacities. An adaptation to drought, scarcity of rain and decreased production of crops is accomplished through community-based measures to sustain human livelihoods (Gyampoh et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>). In a study conducted in Pakistan by Abid et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>), farmers reported that the switch-over from traditional cotton varieties to genetically modified cotton varieties was the result of heavy pest attacks on traditional cotton varieties. They also reported a higher use of heat-tolerant wheat varieties in response to an increase in the frequency of extreme maximum temperature events. Another traditional method implemented by these farmers was the use of crop types that differed from previously used varieties and which were effective against the incidence of substantial pest and insect attacks. Some farmers also replaced cotton crops with maize (Abid et al.
