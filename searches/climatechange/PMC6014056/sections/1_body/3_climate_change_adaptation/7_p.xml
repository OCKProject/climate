<p class="p">The literature on climate change adaptation around the world as presented in this article demonstrates that in various regions of Africa, Asia, Central and South America, the Caribbean and the Indian and Pacific Oceans, there is an adaptation deficit. This calls for an investigation into adaptation strategies employed in other parts of the world in order to increase adaptive capacity through imitation, where applicable. Nevertheless, in most studies, for instance, in Pakistan and Ghana, farmers employ strategies such as crop change, permanent or seasonal migrations and new crop varieties and irrigation practices. Also, the literature reveals that adaptation to climate change is determined by adaptive capacity, and this capacity is influenced by economic and natural resources, government, human resources and technology. However, this study goes beyond adaptation, as presented in other studies around the world, to focus on adaptation measures employed to sustain indigenous practices and the use of IKS to adapt to climate change. Also, unlike other studies on adaptation to climate change, the current study looks beyond government, institutions and technology as sources of adaptive capacity. Rather, it looks at the community-based adaptation strategies that are crafted and employed by the community to adapt to the effects of climate change.</p>
