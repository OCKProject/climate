<p class="p">In Ghana, farmers have always adopted a range of adaptation strategies, such as permanent and seasonal migrations, new crop varieties and irrigation practices as a result of increasing incidence of climate-related shocks and stresses (Tambo 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). There are various adaptation measures employed by households to enhance their resilience to the changes in climate in Ghana. The most common adaptation measure which is practiced by 95% of the people is changing the planting dates (Tambo 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). Similarly, in a study by Wahaa et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) on adaptation strategies, most farmers from different countries in sub-Saharan Africa also use changing the planting dates as an adaptation measure. Tambo (
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) provided some of the most prominent measures that are used in Ghana. These include the use of drought-tolerant or early maturing crop varieties, mixed cropping, crop switching and tree planting which are normally practiced by livestock farmers who plant shade trees to protect their livestock during heat stress. Wahaa et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found traditional sequential cropping system to be the strategy used by most farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. In the study, they discovered that farmers grow the sequential cropping system most frequently applied in their district, composed of two short-growing crop cultivars. These two are single-cropping systems where farmers only grow one long-growing cultivar of the first crop of the traditional sequential cropping system; and the highest-yielding sequential cropping system where farmers grow the sequential cropping system composed of two short-growing crop cultivars with the highest yields. In the same study by Wahaa et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), in 35% of the surveyed districts, one or more sequential cropping systems exist. The sequential cropping systems frequently applied are mostly based on groundnut and maize as well as cassava, rice and wheat. However, few sequential cropping systems exist with sunflowers or soybeans, which are of minor importance in the surveyed households.
