<p class="p">A social theoretical reflection of climate change is centred on several essential classic problems. Szerszynski (
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) asserts that sociologists are interested in presenting how climate change is viewed as a topic of scientific concern. The relationship between nature and culture creates an enduring attraction. In sociology and other related disciplines, Marxist theory is increasingly being deployed to examine the phenomenon of climate change. In this examination, emphasis is placed on how capitalism and its attendant processes are intractably linked to climate change. The view that Marxist scholars advance is that capitalism might have a hand in driving climate change, especially in underdeveloped countries. Urry (
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) asserts that climate change forms new positions of tension and contradiction in contemporary capitalism. Consequently, statistics suggest that more than 2.8 billion people are vulnerable to climate change and variability in socio-economic terms. Developing and underdeveloped countries are the most affected by the phenomenon (Global Humanitarian Forum [GHF] 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). This fact calls for the need to inquire into the knowledge of climate change as well as methods that communities in the developing and underdeveloped communities are using to cope with climate change. Therefore, what Marxist theory does is to present a new perspective on how climate change can be linked to global processes unfolding within society.
