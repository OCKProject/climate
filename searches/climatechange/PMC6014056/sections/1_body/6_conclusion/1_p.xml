<p class="p">In conclusion, the study has established that climate change adaptation measures employed by the community of Mutoko rural district have significantly helped them to sustain their indigenous practices in many spheres of life. Also, the use of IKS through activities such as crop type change from maize to traditional millet and sorghum, which facilitates their traditional lifestyle, re-establishes the community’s indigenous practices since they are made to return to old practices. As a result, even though climate change adaptation is not directly meant to sustain indigenous practices, it is apparent that the unintended outcome of adaptation in the community is sustaining indigenous practices. This study also discovered that the use of IKS to adapt to climate change is the common adaptation method and widely employed by the community. As a result, the method reduces the vulnerability of society to changes in the climate system. From an Afrocentricity stand point, the current study triumphed in achieving its objective. Asante (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1993</xref>) argued that Afrocentricity has to do with the need for African people to be relocated historically, economically, socially, politically and philosophically. In that regard, adaptation measures to sustain indigenous practices and the use of IKS to adapt to climate change in Mutoko rural district was explicitly and implicitly explored from the community’s worldview and culture. Consequently, understanding indigenous adaptation methods employed by the community will significantly help to moderate and mitigate climate change impacts.
