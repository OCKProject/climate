Hence, a qualitative, exploratory study was designed to probe the explanations of climate change and the indigenous adaptation measures used to cope with it in Mutoko. The use of a qualitative research design enabled the researcher to have full interaction with the study participants throughout the study. Thirty participants were drawn from two villages of Mutoko rural community to collect quality and reliable data. The study sample was composed of two groups of respondents, namely Matedza and Chibeta rural community members. The two communities are representative in the sense that they share the same experiences with all other villages in Mutoko rural community. The researcher intended to focus on participants who were either aged 50 years and above or had lived in the area for at least 10 years or more. However, these variables were difficult to establish; therefore, the researcher ultimately considered all individuals who had lived in the area for a reasonable number of years and those who proved to understand how climatic conditions had changed in the area. The reason for the age restriction was to engage people who were capable of giving a comparative explanation of climate change between the period of when they were young and the time of data collection, or the changes they had noticed in the years during which they had lived in the area. Nevertheless, the age variable together with the years of living in the area (Chibeta or Matedza) was fundamental in selecting participants to become part of the study sample. A non-probability technique known as criterion purposive sampling was employed to select the study participants. Bryman (
