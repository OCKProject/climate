As a result, the use of various adaptation measures used by the community is meant to restore the way of life and cultural activities that their forefathers used to perform. In the African context, culture-based mechanisms that are implemented to adapt to climate change are passed from generation to generation. As a result, in so doing the community will be observing their history. In support of this, Adeleke (
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) argues that Afrocentricity draws its orientation from the history of the African subject. Most of the respondents indicated that the community had turned to growing millet and sorghum instead of maize because with maize they constantly get low harvests as it often dries before it is ripe. However, with millet and sorghum they get good harvests even though they receive low rainfall and have extremely hot days. The respondents acknowledged that they have considered millet and sorghum to be a perfect alternative because these crops enable the community to continue practicing their activities, for example, during ceremonies they use sorghum to prepare traditional beer, and the

The study has revealed that even though there are numerous adaptation strategies available to adapt to climate change, the Mutoko community largely relied on indigenous strategies. These strategies are in line with Afrocentricity which theoretically informed the study.
