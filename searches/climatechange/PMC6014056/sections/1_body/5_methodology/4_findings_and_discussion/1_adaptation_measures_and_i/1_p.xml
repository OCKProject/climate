<p class="p">There are numerous adaptation measures to climate change that significantly help the community to sustain indigenous practices. It has been reported that the community no longer grows maize in large quantities; as such, most of the respondents indicated that they have shifted to millet and sorghum in order to adapt to rainfall scarcity. With millet and sorghum, they still continue brewing traditional beer which forms the basis for all traditional functions in the Shona culture. Millet compensates for maize in preparing 
 <italic class="italic">sadza</italic> (thick porridge) which is their staple food. Most respondents mentioned that they had turned from growing maize to growing millet and sorghum because it is more suitable to the current climate. They emphasised that this is in line with what their forefathers used to do because they could have been told by their ancestors to grow millet or sorghum when there was not enough rainfall. Also, the respondents indicated that millet provides them with mealie-meal for 
 <italic class="italic">sadza</italic>, and sorghum provides them with ingredients for traditional beer which they use for most of their functions such as 
 <italic class="italic">kurova guva</italic> (veneration of the dead), 
 <italic class="italic">parufu</italic> (during funerals) and 
 <italic class="italic">paroora</italic> (during traditional weddings). As a result, through the adaptation measures the community employs, cultural practices are also sustained. The shift from maize to millet and sorghum by Mutoko community members supports the assertion of Jianchu et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) that local communities have developed adaptation measures relevant to their cultural values to lessen the impacts of climate threats on their livelihoods. Local communities have developed culture-based mechanisms of adaptation to harsh weather conditions that negatively impact their livelihoods (Jianchu et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). These mechanisms are complex and were developed and are used within cultures. They imply a greater dependability on the use of indigenous practices to sustain their lives (Elia et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>).
