<p class="p">Smit et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>) indicate that adapting to climate change and variability has been subjected to more intensive inquiry. As a result, analysts have seen the need to distinguish types, to characterise attributes and to specify applications of adaptation. For example, adaptation can refer to natural or socio-economic systems and be targeted at different climatic variables or weather events. Burton (
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>) in Smit et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>) defines the adaptation to climate change as the process through which people reduce the adverse effects of climate change on their health and well-being and take advantage of the opportunities that their climatic environment provides. Also, Smith et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>) in Smit et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2000</xref>) define the adaptation to climate change as all the adjustments in behaviour or economic structure that reduce the vulnerability of society to changes in the climate system. Bradshaw, Dolan and Smit (
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) are of the view that adaptations come in many forms and can be characterised according to a suite of attributes such as intent, timing, duration, spatial extent or responsibility.
