<p class="p">Climate change adaptation has been described in different ways by various scholars. However, the varying conceptualisations allude to the same process. Smit and Wandel (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) assert that the application of the term ‘adaptation’ can be traced to Julian Steward, an anthropologist who used ‘cultural adaptation’ to describe the adjustment of ‘culture cores’ to the natural environment through subsistence activities. Denevan (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1983</xref>:401) in Smit and Wandel (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) considers (cultural) adaptation as a ‘process of change in response to a change in the physical environment or a change in internal stimuli, such as demography, economics and organization’. Cultural practices are equated with genetic characteristics in the natural sciences; in this Darwinian view, a group that does not have adequate methods of adapting to environmental stress will face serious challenges when competing for scarce resources and will fail to continue. As a result, a cultural practice is an ‘adaptation’ only if it developed to overcome stress, thereby distinguishing adaptations from ‘adaptive features’ that allow societies to function within their environments regardless of whether or not they evolved as a result of selection. Furthermore, Ford (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) indicates that empirical work conducted in the Arctic describes adaptations employed to cope with a rapidly changing environment with a strong focus on food systems and the dangers of engaging in harvesting activities. Adaptations are underpinned by traditional knowledge of lands and resources, cultural identity and strong social and kinship networks within health systems that combine allopathic and traditional approaches to tackle the risks of climate change. A number of studies also describe community-based initiatives to raise an awareness of climate change impacts and to use research to empower communities. There are examples in the Arctic of the development of surveillance infrastructure for climate-related health outcomes. Few studies, however, have examined how non-Arctic groups are responding to the health effects of climate change, and how economic resources, institutions, technology, equity, information and skills affect this ability.
