<p class="p">An adaptation to the impacts of climate change is accomplished through community-based measures to sustain human livelihoods (Bhusal

 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>). The mechanisms developed by rural communities are complex, are used within cultures and depend on the use of indigenous knowledge in the production of subsistence crops. People’s knowledge of the seasons motivates them to grow subsistence crops with a careful consideration of the soil fertility and texture as well as crop variations which enhance the sustainable production of crops. Madzwamuse (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>) asserts that small-scale farmers produce crops through a knowledge of environmental conditions, without the use of modern scientific knowledge. These adaptation methods are a product of the communities’ priorities, knowledge and capacities which allow them to plan and cope in the midst of climate change. The present study examined rural community members’ knowledge of climate change and their ability to adapt to its impacts on the community. Given the use of community-based strategies used by rural communities, as presented by other writers, this study seeks to establish community-based measures to sustain human livelihoods and the use of IKS to adapt to climate change particular to the Mutoko community. Smit and Wandel (
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) assert that the widely known purpose of adaptation studies in the climate change field is to estimate the degree to which anticipated or actual impacts of climate change scenarios could be moderated or mitigated. Hence, understanding indigenous adaptation methods employed by the community will significantly help in the moderation and mitigation of climate change impacts.
