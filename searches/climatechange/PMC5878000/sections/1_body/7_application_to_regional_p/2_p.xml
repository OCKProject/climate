<p class="p">At most grid boxes, the observed changes fall within bounds that are expected from a random process given the grid box variance. For example, 83.8% of all grid boxes fall within the 90% CI. Recall that we have been conservative by ignoring the lag 1 autocorrelation in calculating the CI and that the real fraction showing no significant change will be somewhat larger, but we expect it to be less than the CI (90%). The key point is that the range of the observed change in
