The autocorrelation is computed by shifting the data series in time and calculating the correlation with the original time series. Autocorrelation as a function of time means the progress of it (at any lag) as time passes. The autocorrelation at lag zero is one by definition. A useful reference is the autocorrelation function for a purely random (i.e., independent in a statistical sense and not implying nondeterminism) time series that, for all other lags, has an autocorrelation that is statistically indistinguishable from zero.
