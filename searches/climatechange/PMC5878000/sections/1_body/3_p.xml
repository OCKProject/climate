<p class="p">For example, in the Murray–Darling Basin in southeastern Australia, the autocorrelation of the annual 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> time series (1901–2007) is statistically indistinguishable from zero for lags from 1 to 30 y (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). That result shows that the 106-y record of annual rainfall for the Murray–Darling Basin is indistinguishable from a random process. In a physical sense, it means that there is no memory (
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>) of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> from one year to the next. Given the seemingly random nature of annual 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> time series (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>
 <xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>), we anticipated that the Murray–Darling Basin results might be typical of many regions worldwide.
