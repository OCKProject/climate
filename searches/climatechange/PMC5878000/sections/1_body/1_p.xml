<p class="p">Recently, it has been widely argued that common climate variables (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>) will be stationary if the mean remains constant over climatic (e.g., 30-y) timescales (for example, in ref. 
 <xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref> and earlier in refs. 
 <xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref> and 
 <xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>). However, the formal definition of stationarity goes beyond the mean and involves higher-order statistics (variance and higher-order moments) as well as the autocovariance (or autocorrelation) (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>â€“
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>). This formal definition, known as strict stationarity, has limited utility in practical applications, because we can only ever have samples from the underlying population. For that reason, practical applications use a different framework known as weak stationarity or sometimes also known as covariance stationarity, which uses a definition that is restricted to the mean and the autocorrelation (or autocovariance) (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>). We adopt this as our practical definition of stationarity. With that in mind, a time series is considered stationary if (
 <italic class="italic">i</italic>) the mean is constant and (
 <italic class="italic">ii</italic>) the autocorrelation only depends on the relative position in the time series (
 <xref rid="r16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>).
