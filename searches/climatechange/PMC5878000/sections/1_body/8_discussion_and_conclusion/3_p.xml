 </inline-formula> in each grid box was generated by a purely random process. With a large number of grid boxes (we have 1,987), one can expect that the number showing significant lag 1 autocorrelation will only depend on the CI chosen by the analyst. For example, for a 90% CI, we know, a priori, that 10% (5% at either tail) would show statistically significant lag 1 autocorrelation. For a negative autocorrelation of annual 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">
  <math id="i70" class="math">
   <mi class="mi">P</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, the statistical interpretation is that a high value of annual rainfall implies less rainfall in the next year, and the fraction showing a statistically significant negative value is more or less exactly that expected for random process [in 
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>, 4.5% (compare with 5%) at the 90% level and 2.7% (compare with 2.5%) at the 95% level]. However, there are plausible physical interpretations for a positive lag 1 autocorrelation (
 <xref rid="r37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r38" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>), and we observe a higher fraction of statistically significant lag 1 autocorrelation values than expected for a purely random process. For example, we estimate that an additional 14.1% (90% confidence) of the grid boxes have 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">
  <math id="i71" class="math">
   <mi class="mi">P</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> that is nonrandom (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Close inspection of the autocorrelation at other lags (

  <italic class="italic">SI Appendix</italic>, Fig. S4
 </ext-link>) shows that many of those lags are likely noise, because their location varies with the lag. The obvious exception is the Sahel region of Africa, where the positive autocorrelation can persist for lags up to 6 or 7 y (
