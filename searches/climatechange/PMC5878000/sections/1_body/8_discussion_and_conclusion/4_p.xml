<p class="p">One should not confuse the statistical significance discussed above with the functional significance. Even under a stationary climate, extreme events will occur. For example, in our own experience, the most recent drought in the Murray–Darling Basin (1998–2009) (
 <xref rid="r40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>) had severe socioeconomic, hydrologic, and biological consequences, and yet, the time series of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> remained more or less stationary (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>). In fact, the randomness typical of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> time series as reported here means that one may have to wait at least a human lifetime before being confident about a statistically significant change in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref"/>–
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>). That makes it even more important for hydrologists and climate scientists to rigorously incorporate the variance into assessments of changes in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>.
