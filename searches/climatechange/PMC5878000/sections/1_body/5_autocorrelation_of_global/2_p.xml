<p class="p">Most grid boxes (76.3% within the 90% confidence limit and 83.6% within the 95% limit) show no significant lag 1 autocorrelation (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Note that, with a 90% CI, one would a priori expect 10% of all grid boxes (5% at either tail) to have a significant lag 1 autocorrelation. We found that result for the negative lag 1 autocorrelation, but we also report that around 19% of the grid boxes have a positive autocorrelation (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This is 14% more than the expected 5%. Given the general lack of correlation for lags 2â€“8, the time series at most, but not all, grid boxes can be considered statistically indistinguishable from a random process. To give specific examples of randomness and nonrandomness, we also show the 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">
  <math id="i33" class="math">
   <mi class="mi">P</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> time series at four grid boxes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Two of those (numbered 1 and 3 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) are from grid boxes where the time series is random. One typical time series (numbered 2 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) is from the western Sahel region in Africa, where the long-term 
 <inline-formula class="inline-formula">
  <math id="i34" class="math">
   <mi class="mi">P</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> record is quasicyclical, and as a result, there is a positive and statistically significant lag 1 autocorrelation throughout that region. The remaining time series (numbered 4 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>) represents the relatively rare occurrence of a statistically significant but negative lag 1 autocorrelation. Close inspection of that time series (from Mozambique) shows that there has been a slight tendency for a wet year to follow a dry year and vice versa.
