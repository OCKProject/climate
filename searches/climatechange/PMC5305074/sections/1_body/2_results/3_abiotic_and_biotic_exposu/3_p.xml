<p class="p">When looking into more details at future exposure, all populations composing the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> are exposed to a certain degree (but for ca. 8% of the distribution, concentrated around the central plateau and north-western edge of the study area, seed zones number 1, 2, 5, 16 and 17, which were classified as low exposure for both, abiotic and biotic components). Nevertheless, only circa 5% of the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> was classified as highly exposed to both abiotic and biotic factors. These populations were located in the northernmost distribution of the species, mostly in the populations from seed zones 3 and 6 (see
