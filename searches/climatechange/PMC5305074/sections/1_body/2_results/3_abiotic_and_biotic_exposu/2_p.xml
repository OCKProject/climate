However, this is mainly due to a higher abiotic exposure, as the rate of populations under both abiotic and biotic exposure is maintained between both periods. Our results point to a reduction in biotic exposure that is particularly important in the north-western side of the Iberian Peninsula (seed zones 1, 2 and 3; comparison Figs
