<p class="p">Pseudo-absences are ultimately representing the entire study area so they are very similar for the pine and the disease (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s002" class="xref">S2 Fig</xref>). All variables included in the SDMs were highly significant for both the pine and the disease (p-value &lt; 0.0001). As for variable importance (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>), BIO17 obtained by far the highest score in the SDM of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> as compared to the other variables included in the model. Variables in the SDM of the disease obtained more balanced scores than in the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>, although BIO4 was the most influential variable. Finally, the threshold values maximizing TSS, and thus employed for transforming probabilistic into binary projections, were 60.5 and 45.0 respectively for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>.
