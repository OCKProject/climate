 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s002" class="xref">S2b Fig</xref>). The distribution of the disease seemed to be constrained by low temperatures (represented by BIO6) as well as by low precipitation regimes (BIO12 and BIO17; see

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s002" class="xref">S2b Fig</xref>). Short distance to the coast was also found to be very relevant for the diseaseâ€™s habitat suitability, presumably due to the higher relative humidity in these locations, a key factor during the infection stage [

 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. The SDM of the disease performed very well as assessed by its evaluation scores (TSS = 0.93, sensitivity = 99.26 and specificity = 93.63), revealing a very important role of climate in determining the distribution of the disease. The detected suitable area was located along the north-western side of the Iberian Peninsula (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171549.g001" class="xref">Fig 1d and 1e</xref>), which is consistent with the declared infection outbreaks in Spain. We also detected marginal suitability areas along the eastern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, where there are no declared infection outbreaks.
