<p class="p">We found few differences between the mean environmental conditions in presences and pseudo-absences records of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s002" class="xref">S2a Fig</xref>), an outcome that was expected given the low explained deviance scores obtained by most of its environmental predictors (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Nevertheless, this analysis only considered environmental variables individually, and the SDM fitted for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>, which considers altogether the set of selected environmental variables, had an acceptable performance as revealed by its TSS score (0.69) and its sensitivity and specificity values (93.50 and 75.30 respectively).
