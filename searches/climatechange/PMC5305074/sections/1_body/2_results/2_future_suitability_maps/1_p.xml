<p class="p">Future suitability maps revealed a reduction in suitable territory for both the pine and the disease (see

Concerning pitch canker disease, the reduction in habitat suitability mainly occurred in the north-western edge of the study area (seed zones 1 and 2), while the rest of likely suitable areas was very similar to that detected as currently suitable for the species (comparison between
