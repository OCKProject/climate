<p class="p">SDMs require an occurrence dataset including presence records (for all statistical algorithms) and, in general, also absence, pseudo-absence or background records of the target species to base their predictions upon (more details can be found in [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]). However, the difficulty associated to detect real absence records commonly translates into a generalized use of pseudo-absence or background records. In our case, we obtained an occurrence dataset composed of presence and pseudo-absence records for our pine species (

In this section, details on the method used for selecting presences are provided. However, as algorithm selection played a major role in defining the number and selection technique of pseudo-absences, these details are thus provided within the SDM section along with other algorithm specifications (more details can be found in [
