<p class="p">Concerning pitch canker disease, we used data from a survey performed by different regional authorities in Spain and collected by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Environment in the period 2006–2012. We obtained 159 municipalities where at some point during that period a disease outbreak was declared, located in the north-western side of the Iberian Peninsula. All pitch canker disease outbreaks were reported in 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus radiata</italic> D.Don. In order to select adequate coordinates to represent presence records, we divided the study area in a 1 Km grid and selected the 1444 grid cells that were simultaneously (i) within the positive-detected municipality borders and (ii) within the host species’ distribution (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">radiata</italic> obtained from the NFI). Finally, to prevent the municipality size from affecting model outputs (as bigger municipalities tended to have a higher number of disease presences included in the models) we considered a maximum of 10 presences per municipality i.e. the mean number of potential disease presences per municipality. Thus, in those municipalities enclosing less than 10 potential presences all records were included within the definitive presence data set, whereas in those municipalities where potential presences were larger, 10 records were randomly selected to be included within the final presence dataset. The definitive presence dataset reckoned 943 records. Similarly to the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>, all the rest of the study area was considered as potential pseudo-absence records.
