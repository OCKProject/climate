<p class="p">In the case of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>, we used the third Spanish National Forestry Inventory (NFI), developed between 1997â€“2007 and based on a 1 km grid. This pine is broadly distributed within the Spanish Iberian Peninsula and it has been extensively used in afforestation programs. However, there is no information concerning the fitness of the planted stands or their longevity, or whether they are artificially maintained. Accordingly, to be conservative, we only considered native populations as presences to train a SDM aiming at capturing the relationship between climate and the distribution of the species. In addition, the native distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> is also broad and encompasses very different environments, making it thus likely that all different habitats occupied by the species within the Spanish Iberian Peninsula are adequately represented. Accordingly, presences were selected as those plots where natural and seed-born populations of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> were reported as one among the three major species, which after removing duplicates, led to a set of 6081 plots. We further eliminated those plots not included within the native distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> (assessed from [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]) which reduced the number of selected plots to 2971, and we used the central coordinates of the plots as presence records. The rest of the study area, not fulfilling these criteria, was considered as potential pseudo-absence records.
