<p class="p">For the host and the disease separately, we obtained 18 future binary projections which classified each grid cell of the study area as suitable or unsuitable in 2050. In order to incorporate the uncertainty derived from the wide range of future climate predictions available avoiding the use of an average prediction, we followed the methodology proposed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. According to their work, the number of future climate predictions projecting suitability in one specific cell was used as an indicator of the degree of agreement among models about the future habitat being suitable in that cell. Thus, the 18 binary projections were combined resulting in a map in which values could possibly range from 0 (none of the future climate predictions was projected to be suitable) to 1.0 (all future climate predictions tested were projected to be suitable) with higher scores indicating higher agreement of suitable habitat in the future. Finally, as proposed in [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], three different future suitability categories were defined as: “likely suitable” with suitability scores &gt;0.7 (suitable habitat for more than 70% of future projections), “uncertain” with a suitability score of 0.36–0.7, and “likely unsuitable” with suitability scores &lt;0.36. We performed this analysis for each species individually.
