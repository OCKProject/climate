<p class="p">Future climatic variables (monthly accumulated precipitation and monthly maximum and minimum temperature) representative of 2050 (average for 2041â€“2060) were obtained from nine of the most recent Global Climate Models (GCMs) used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment report [

 <xref rid="pone.0171549.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). As future projection scenarios, we used two different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) namely RCP4.5 (medium emission scenario) and RCP8.5 (high emission scenario) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref057" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Thus, the combination of 9 GCMs and two different scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) led to a total of 18 different future climate predictions. These climatic predictions were combined and used together through this study (see Future suitability maps section) to assess abiotic and biotic exposure on
