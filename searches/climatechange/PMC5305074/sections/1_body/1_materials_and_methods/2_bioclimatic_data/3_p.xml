<p class="p">In order to avoid multicollinearity effects, variables with Pearson correlations lower than 0.60 were retained (see

We avoided the use of BIO8 and BIO9, because the steep gradient shown by these variables, in which very often two adjacent cells are characterized by extremely different values within the study area for no obvious reason, may lead to artefacts in the SDM output maps. Finally, possible collinearity problems were circumvented by performing a Variance Inflation Factor (VIF—[

The final sets of relevant weakly correlated variables to build SDMs were (i) BIO4—Temperature Seasonality, BIO12—Annual Precipitation, BIO17—Precipitation of Driest Quarter and elevation for

For both pine and disease, mean and standard deviation values of the environmental variables were also calculated separately for presences and absences to get insights about their currently inhabited habitat conditions.
