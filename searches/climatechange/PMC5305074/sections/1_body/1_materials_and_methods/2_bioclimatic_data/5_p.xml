<p class="p">GCMs, which have a coarse resolution (
 <italic class="italic">ca</italic>. 2 degrees), were transformed to a local scale using a two-step analogue statistical downscaling method developed by [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. The first step is an analogue approach [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>] in which the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> most similar days to the day to be downscaled are selected by using four different meteorological large-scale fields. The second step differed depending on the target variable: (i) precipitation was calculated by re-assigning the calculated amounts using an empirical distribution function; and (ii) temperature was obtained by using a multiple linear regression analysis using the 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> most analogous days selected. We followed this procedure for each AEMET meteorological station and for each target day, and then averaged the resulting daily simulations to obtain monthly means. Further details of the methodology are described in [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref058" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">58</xref>]. A systematic error was obtained when comparing the simulated data from climate models with the observed data from reference time series due to the inherent downscaling methodology error and to the inner GCM error (which usually incorporates a bias over the data). Thus, to improve our simulations, future climate projections were corrected according to a parametric quantileâ€“quantile method [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>]. Then, the obtained variables (future monthly accumulated precipitation and future monthly maximum and minimum temperatures) were interpolated across the entire study area following the same procedure as employed in current climate interpolations (TPS). Finally, we calculated the set of selected WORLDCLIM bioclimatic variables representative of 2050 namely BIO4, BIO6, BIO12, BIO17. We assumed that Distance to the coast and Elevation, remained constant within the analyzed period (from now to 2050)
