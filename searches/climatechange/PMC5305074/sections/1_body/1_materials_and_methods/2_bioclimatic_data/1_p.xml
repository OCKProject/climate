 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] has already been reported as problematic in the Spanish Iberian Peninsula (see [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref047" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]), as its interpolations are based on 142 clustered meteorological stations, among which the highest altitudes are barely represented (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref>). To obtain accurate and high-resolution bioclimatic surfaces, we used 5053 meteorological stations with observed daily precipitation data and 1830 with observed daily maximum and minimum temperature data from AEMET, covering the period between 1950–2000 (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0171549.s001" class="xref">S1 Fig</xref> for a comparison between WORDLCLIM and AEMET’s meteorological stations). First, monthly variables were calculated as monthly accumulated precipitation and as monthly means for maximum and minimum temperature. Then, we interpolated these monthly variables by means of Thin Plate Splines (TPS) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>] using elevation as independent co-variable to obtain continuous surfaces (1 Km grid cell) across the study area. We selected TPS as the interpolation method, as it has performed well in previous comparative tests of multiple interpolation techniques [
