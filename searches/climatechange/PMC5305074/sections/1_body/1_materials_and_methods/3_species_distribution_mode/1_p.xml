<p class="p">We used generalized additive models (GAM—[
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">61</xref>]) to capture the relationship between climate and species’ occurrence records. This algorithm has been widely used in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref062" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>], as it allows mimicking different types of response curves using a nonparametric smoothing function instead of parametric terms, providing a better alternative than most other widely-used models such as generalized linear models or classification tree analysis [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Models were processed in BIOMOD [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>] using the package “biomod2” (default settings for the model) in the R statistical software environment [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>]. As recommended for GAM in [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>], we randomly selected 10000 pseudo-absences, and same weight was given to presences and absences. Finally, a five independent 70–30 training-evaluating subsets of the data for model evaluation was performed, and model performance was assessed as the mean True Skill Statistic (TSS—[
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]). Based on the model trained on current climate data, we obtained for both, the pine and the disease, a probabilistic prediction of habitat suitability for each climatic data set (current climate and 18 future climate predictions). These were converted to binary suitability maps by defining probability thresholds that maximized TSS values. Thereby, we obtained 19 binary projections, one corresponding to current climate and the remaining 18 to the different future climate predictions tested.
