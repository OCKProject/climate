<p class="p">Variable importance was analysed following the method available in the package “biomod2”: First, the model was trained with the selected environmental variables and predictions were performed (reference predictions). Then, one environmental variable was changed to random values and new predictions were done. This process was repeated four times with each environmental variable included in the model. Finally, we calculated Pearson´s correlations—which range between 0 (no correlation) and 1 (maximum correlation)—between reference predictions and the new ones. The final score for each environmental variable is provided as the difference between 1 and mean correlation among the four repetitions performed for each variable so that higher values indicate higher importance.</p>
