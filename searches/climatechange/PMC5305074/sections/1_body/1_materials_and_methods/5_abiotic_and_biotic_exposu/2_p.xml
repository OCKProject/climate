<p class="p">To assess future abiotic exposure, we employed 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>’s future suitability map. Likely suitable areas highlighted locations barely exposed where no special management for adaptation to climate change was needed. Contrarily, likely unsuitable areas indicated high abiotic exposure sites where additional measures should be considered such as breeding programs or silvicultural actions enhancing the species’ capacity to cope with climate change. Furthermore, the future suitability map of the disease was used to assess future biotic exposure. Likely suitable locations for pitch canker were considered as high biotic exposure areas where urgent actions were needed to improve the capacities of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> to avoid possible infections, while likely unsuitable locations were considered as low biotic exposure areas where no further actions were needed. Finally, uncertain areas in both future suitability maps indicated locations where there was not an agreement among future climate predictions and, thus, where monitoring is needed in order to see the development of populations and to address its management accordingly.
