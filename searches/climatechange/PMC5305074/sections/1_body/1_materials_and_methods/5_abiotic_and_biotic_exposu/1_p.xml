<p class="p">Abiotic and biotic exposures of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> were assessed by means of current and future suitability maps (both for 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> and pitch canker disease respectively). Particularly, when assessing future exposure, we used the three different suitability categories defined in the future suitability maps,—i.e. “likely suitable”, “uncertain” and “likely unsuitable”- as the basis for recommending the most appropriate management to facilitate populations’ ability to cope with climate change. For this analysis, we considered the entire distribution of the species 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic>, including both native and planted populations, and the results were presented following the Spanish seed zones of forest reproductive material [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>]. Seed zones delimit ecologically homogeneous distribution areas and, thus, are expected to group genetically similar populations likely to be locally adapted, as well as to differ in their productivity, and thereby in their economic impact on regional economies. Consequently, seed zones are appropriate as management units and provide a perfect framework to guide forest management.
