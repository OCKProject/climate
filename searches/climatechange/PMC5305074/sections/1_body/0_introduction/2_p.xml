 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]; provide a useful tool for assessing abiotic and biotic exposures, as they utilize associations between environmental variables and known speciesâ€™ occurrence records [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], enabling the assessment of habitat suitability for a given species under different climatic scenarios [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>]. This approach can also be extended to a host-disease relationship, by analyzing environmental suitability in each of the two components, and assuming that their interaction will not change. The relationship between environmental variables and the occurrence of a species can be addressed through correlative or mechanistic approaches [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], and both methodologies have been found to be effective [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Particularly in the case of plant distribution modeling, correlative approaches have been primarily used to circumvent the difficulty associated to scaling up from physiological attributes to ecosystem level processes [
