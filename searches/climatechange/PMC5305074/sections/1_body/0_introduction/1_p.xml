<p class="p">Anthropogenic climate change affects forest ecosystems greatly, demanding management plans aimed at increasing the capacity of forests to cope with climate change, and guaranteeing that they maintain their essential role of providing services for society [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In this context, assessing exposure—an evaluation of the magnitude of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]—becomes crucial, and should ideally consider both abiotic and biotic factors [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. The alterations of abiotic factors due to climate change, such as increased intensity and duration of droughts (mid-latitudes) and ascending global mean temperatures [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], have led to increased tree mortality [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] and northwards shift of distributions of many species [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Because of these major climate-related alterations, species-specific abiotic exposure has been commonly addressed in the literature [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. In contrast, there have been less studies addressing how pests and pathogens are responding to climate change and their effect on hosts [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Biotic exposure is rarely contemplated when assessing vulnerability to climate change (some exceptions [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]), despite their effects becoming progressively evident [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>]. Specifically, forest pathogen invasions have grown exponentially in Europe in the last decades, with introductions mainly from North America and recently from Asia [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. In most situations, these invasions had an important consequence on native tree species: as Dutch elm disease on mature elm trees (

 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], or ash dieback on ash (
