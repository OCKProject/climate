 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0171549.g001" class="xref">Fig 1a and 1b</xref>), where the suitable habitat extended largely beyond the current distribution. For now, the integration of additional explanatory variables in our models is limited by the aforementioned lack of empirical data, and also in relation to the host-disease dynamic. Moreover, although incorporating a wide range of GCMs (9) and scenarios (2) in SDMs has enabled us to reduce the uncertainty derived from the wide range of future climate predictions, there are additional sources of uncertainty, e.g. the one derived from algorithm selection [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]. However, our models succeed in assessing the relationship between climate and the pineâ€™s distribution in order to evaluate whether its current populations are likely to be subjected to climatic stress in the future (see [
