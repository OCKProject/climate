<p class="p">Other considerations to take into account in our models are that future suitability maps rely on the assumption of niche conservation along a 30-year timespan (i.e. a constant relationship between each species and climate). In the case of

 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> this is foreseeable, as it is a long-lived species with long rotation times (from 30 to almost 100 years) and, thus, involving only one generation during this period. Furthermore, although
