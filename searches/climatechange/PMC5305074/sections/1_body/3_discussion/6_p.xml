<p class="p">The suitability maps of pitch canker disease can be used to assess biotic exposure of any other (pine) species affected by it, although its incidence or the severity of it would vary according to species susceptibility. In fact, for this study, we trained our models based on infections detected in 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">radiata</italic> although there is some evidence indicating that 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> is more resistant to the infection, as shown by the progress curve of the area under disease (AUDPC) [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>], and the mean wound size [
 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>]. Furthermore, procuring a consistent model of pitch canker disease is challenging given the difficulty associated to obtain a reliable occurrence dataset. In addition, other factors not related to climate, e.g. distribution of the host species, different pine species resistance to the disease and effective prevention plans, also influence the current distribution of the disease.
