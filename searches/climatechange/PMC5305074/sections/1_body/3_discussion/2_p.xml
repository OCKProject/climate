<p class="p">Current suitable locations for the disease concentrated in the north-central and north-western edge of the study area, supporting previous studies predicting the potential global distribution of pitch canker disease in

 <xref rid="pone.0171549.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Furthermore, we found that future climatic changes are likely to constrain its distribution to the north of the Iberian Peninsula (mostly in seed zones 3 and 6), thus reducing biotic exposure on the north western pine populations (seed zones 1 and 2). This outcome is probably linked to the expected reduction in precipitation [
