<p class="p">Overall, the entire distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">pinaster</italic> in the Spanish Iberian Peninsula is affected by abiotic exposure, meaning that predicted climatic shifts result in a large reduction of its environmental suitability across the study area (but for some exceptions—see seed zones 1, 2, 5, 16 and 17). Abiotic exposure seems to be particularly important along the central and southernmost edge of the Iberian Peninsula, as all populations in these locations are highly exposed. This result is consistent with those obtained in a previous work showing that the genetic groups of
