<p class="p">The future change in potential for global abundance is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref> for two RCPs and is based on the average of 5 global-circulation model (GCM; CMIP5) at the 0.5 ×0.5 arc degree global grid scale. Here the change means the difference in total female adults per larval site per year between 2090–2099 and 1987–2016. We have chosen the global abundance value during 1987–2016 as the baseline to see the changes in the end of this century relative to the beginning of this century. This is plotted with red representing for increase and blue for decrease.
