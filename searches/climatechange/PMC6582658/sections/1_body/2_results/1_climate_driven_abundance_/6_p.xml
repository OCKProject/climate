<p class="p">In the future under RCP2.6—the lowest carbon emission scenario—the potential vector abundance is projected to increase by at least the same amount as over the past 110 years, but during only a 20-year period, by 2030. After that, the potential of vector abundance levels off, following the temperature trend. The total vector abundance change over the two centuries is more than 20% and the temperature rise is about 2.6°C. The average increase per degree in this scenario is 8.2%.</p>
