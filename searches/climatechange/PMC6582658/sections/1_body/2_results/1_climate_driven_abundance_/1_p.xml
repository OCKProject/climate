 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> is estimated by season, based on climate variability alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>; Model A). After introducing a small female adult population in the warmest season of the year in 1999, vector populations at each stage were simulated up to the end of 2009. The potential abundance of the female adult population was summarized for each season (December–February; March–May; June–August; September–November) and then averaged over one decade (2000–2009). The highest potential abundance of the female adult vector is estimated along the equator, in south Asia, mid - Africa, Central America, and most of South America (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Among the four seasons, the summer and autumn—which correspond to June to November in the northern hemisphere, or December to May in the southern hemisphere—have the highest potential for vector abundance. This postdiction (Model A) showed high agreement when validated to a rich dataset of vector occurrence records (see
