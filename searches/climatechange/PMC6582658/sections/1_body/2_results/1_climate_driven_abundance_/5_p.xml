<p class="p">The change in global average intensity of the potential abundance per decade was estimated over two centuries (1905–2099), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4" class="xref">Figure 4</xref>. During the past 110 years (1905–2014), the global abundance potential has increased about 9.5% as the global temperature has risen about 1.2°C. The largest increase (8.2%) occurred over the last two decades as a response to a rapid increase in temperature.
