 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" class="xref">Supplementary Material</xref>. Potential vector abundance is defined as the average number of female vectors during a given time period that can be generated from each larval site, and is fully dependent on climatic conditions. The number of larval sites per square kilometer is estimated through human population density and GDPpc. From this, potential vector abundance is transformed to estimate the actual vector density.
