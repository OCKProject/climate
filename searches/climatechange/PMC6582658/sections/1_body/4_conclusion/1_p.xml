<p class="p">Our study indicates high abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> in many regions of the world with a tropical and subtropical climate. We suggest the highest abundance in South Asia, mid-Africa and South America, and a clear seasonal pattern. Incorporating socio-economic factors, the global distribution and abundance show pronounced clustering of the vectors around densely populated urban areas, reflected by the abundance of potential food (blood meals) and human-created larval sites. Over the last century, 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic> is postdicted to have expanded the suitable areas for its habituation and abundance. The increase in the abundance of this vector correlates closely with the global temperature increase. The change in the potential of global abundance over the last century up to today is estimated to be an increase of 9.5% globally and a further increase to 20 or 30% under a low compared to a high carbon emission future, respectively. The largest increase to date has occurred in the last two decades, indicating a tipping point in climate-driven global abundance which is stabilized at the earliest in the mid-tweny-first century. Our findings indicate that climate change mitigation would considerably suppress vector abundance in the second half of the twenty-first century. Following the Paris Agreement has a large impact on the potential abundance of this potent vector, 
 <italic class="italic">A. aegypti</italic>, and therefore may prevent many severe infectious diseases epidemics in the near future. Our study further indicates that the actual abundance and distribution are sensitive to socio-economic development.
