<p id="Par44" class="p">As required by the Antarctic Treaty, all research was conducted after a preliminary environmental assessment and under a permit issued by the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office. All importation of specimens into the UK was under relevant UK government department permits (DEFRAâ€”Department of the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs). This study did not involve animal experiments and so no ethical approval was required.</p>
