<p id="Par47" class="p">In Spring 2014 concrete markers were laid at each site 1 m apart in grids, each covering an area of 9 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (akin to the design developed by Brown et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>] and described further by Barnes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>], providing both a grid reference for sample extraction and a method of monitoring iceberg impacts). The effect of any recorded disturbance of the grid markers could therefore be correlated with sediment community composition. To further test for the effect of iceberg scour on soft substratum community dynamics, Site F was situated on the site of a recent scour.
