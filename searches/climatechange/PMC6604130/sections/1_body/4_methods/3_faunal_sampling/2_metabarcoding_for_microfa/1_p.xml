<p id="Par50" class="p">Benthic sediment samples were collected in triplicate from South Cove site C and Hangar Cove site F, in the summer of 2014 only, using a 100 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> corer and kept at − 80 °C. For all sediment cores the upper 20 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of the core were screened using a 45 μm sieve, and 8–10 g of the homogenized sediment was used for direct eDNA extraction, using the PowerMax
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Soil DNA Isolation Kit (MO-BIO) following the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA extracts were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis, quantified using the NanoDrop2000 spectrophometer and diluted to 10 ng/µL. The universal primers ‘TAReuk454FWD1’ (5′-CCAGCASCYGCGGTAATTCC-3′) and ‘TAReukREV3’ (5′-ACTTTCGTTCTTGATYRA-3′) were used to amplify ca. 400 bp of the 18S rRNA V4 region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65" class="xref">65</xref>]. The mitochondrial COI 313 bp gene region was amplified using the primers forward “mlCOIintF” (5′ GGWACWGGWTGAACWGTWTAYCCYCC-3′) and reverse “jgHCO2198” (5′-TAAACTTCAGGGTGACCAAARAAYCA-3′) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" class="xref">66</xref>]. All forward and reverse primer combinations were designed to include the Illumina MiSeq 8 nt index-tags (i5/i7) and Adaptors (P5/P7) to differentiate all samples and triplicates. PCR conditions were performed similarly to the Fonseca and Lallias [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>] method. Briefly, PCR amplification of the specified nSSU region was performed with a 2-step PCR approach using 1 µl of genomic DNA template (1:500 dilutions; 10 ng/μl) in 3 × 40 µl independent reactions with Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega). The first PCR involved a 5 min denaturation at 95 °C, followed by 15 and 20 cycles (18S and COI) with 30 s 98 °C, 30 s 50 °C, 30 s 72 °C and final extension of 10 min at 72 °C. At this stage, amplicons from the first PCR were purified using the HT ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix) following manufactures’ instructions. To add the Illumina index tag adaptors a second PCR using 7 µl of purified PCR1 products was performed using the same conditions as before but with 15 cycles and annealing temperature of 55 °C. Negative controls (ultrapure water only) were included for all amplification reactions. PCR products were visualized and purified (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) in an agarose gel and quantified using the Agilent Bioanalyser. All PCR products were diluted to the same concentration of 3 ng/μl, pooled together to create one amplicon-library and pair-end sequenced on a single run of the Illumina Miseq platform using the v2 Illumina chemistry (2 × 250 bp). Illumina raw sequences from both markers (18S and COI) were analysed using the dada2 plugin within QIIME2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. This plugin does not rely on OTU clustering, but rather utilizes modern sequencing quality by producing fine-scale resolution through amplicon sequence variants (ASVs), resolving differences of as little as a single nucleotide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. Its workflow consists of: filtering, de-replication, sample inference, reference-free chimera detection, and paired-end reads merging [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67" class="xref">67</xref>]. ASVs with less than four sequences were discarded and taxonomies assigned by applying the QIIME2 consensus blast ‘q2-feature-classifier’ with the ‘classify-consensus-blast command’ [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">68</xref>] using 0.95 and 0.97 classification thresholds for the 18S rRNA and COI, respectively. The 18S rRNA data was used to infer all ecological patterns at higher taxonomic ranks whereas the COI data was only used to compare the number of species identified by the morphology and eDNA metabarcoding approaches.
