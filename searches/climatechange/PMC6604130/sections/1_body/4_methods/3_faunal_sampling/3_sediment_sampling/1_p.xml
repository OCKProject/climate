<p id="Par51" class="p">At the same time as suction samples were collected, additional cores were taken for sediment particle size analysis. All sediment cores were collected in triplicate from undisturbed sediment at each site using a cylindrical hand-held plastic corer of 8 cm diameter × 20 cm length. Extracted sediment from all three cores was mixed, rinsed with fresh water and subjected to sequential decantation of percolated material to reduce the salt content. This was then dried and weighed. To measure organic content a random subsample of dry sediment (approx 150 g) was taken and weighed. Organic content was quantified through the loss on ignition method (after [

The remaining sediment was weighed and passed through a stack of sieves in a vibrating sieve shaker (15 min, 50 kpa). Each distinct fraction was weighed and the percentages of gravel (&gt; 2 mm), sand (2 mm to &lt; 63 μm) and mud (&lt; 63 μm) were recorded for each site. Mean size, sorting and skewness were calculated using GRADISTAT [
