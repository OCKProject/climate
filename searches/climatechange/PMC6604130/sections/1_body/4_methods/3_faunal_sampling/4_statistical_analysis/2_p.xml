<p id="Par53" class="p">For morphotaxonomy multivariate analyses abundance data were fourth root transformed and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (nMDS) applied to a Bray–Curtis similarity matrix, to produce ordination plots, representing the similarity in benthic assemblage amongst sites and coves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]. Fourth root was determined as the most appropriate transformation through comparison of shade plots, which visualize the influence of extreme values under different transformations. For metabarcoding, Sørensen’s similarity coefficient among samples was computed based on a presence/absence similarity matrix and was used to create cluster dendrograms and nMDS with 500 random starts.
