<p id="Par58" class="p">Correlations between benthic assemblages and the sediment characteristics (% gravel, % sand, % mud, sediment thickness and % ash free dry mass (AFDM) and water depth) were analysed using PRIMER BEST Biota-environment (BIOENV) to determine which factors best explained the distribution of the faunal community. All data were normalised before analysis.</p>
