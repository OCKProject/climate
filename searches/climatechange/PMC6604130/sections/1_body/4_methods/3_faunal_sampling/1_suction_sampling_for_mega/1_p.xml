<p id="Par49" class="p">To investigate benthic assemblages, SCUBA (self-contained underwater breathing apparatus) divers used a 10 cm diameter suction sampler fitted with a 1 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> mesh sampling bag to extract the benthos from 0.25 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> quadrats. For each site (A to F) quadrats within the 3 × 3 m grid were chosen using a random number generator but if the selected area of seabed was adjacent to a quadrat that had been sampled within the previous 6 months another quadrat was randomly selected. This was a precaution taken to ensure data were not affected by any small disturbance caused by divers in the adjacent quadrat during a previous sampling. Organisms retained within the 1 mm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> mesh suction sampler bag were taken back to the laboratory counted and sorted into morphotypes, while alive. Individuals were either identified during sorting were or identified later from preserved specimens. Individuals greater than 1 mm but less than 5 mm were classified as macrofauna and anything larger (up to 10 cm) as megafauna. 99% of the Mollusca were identified to genus level or higher. Individuals belonging to all other Phyla were identified as far as possible, at least to a minimum of family level, by experts using taxonomic keys. Fragments of drifting algae and any exposed pebbles that may have been colonized by encrusting fauna, e.g. bryozoans and spirorbid polychaete worms also collected by the suction sampler were not included in the subsequent mega and macro-faunal community analysis. Post extraction, the removed sediment thickness was measured at five random points using a ruler and the average sediment thickness was calculated.
