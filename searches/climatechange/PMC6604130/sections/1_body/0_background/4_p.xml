<p id="Par16" class="p">Here, we present the first study to comprehensively analyse the composition of Antarctic shallow water benthic sediment communities at two sites replicated sampling over 2.5 years. Fauna were catalogued across all size ranges from the mega- (10 cm–5 mm), macro- (5–1 mm) through to the micro-fauna (&lt; 1 mm). A combination of morpho-taxonomy and metabarcoding approaches were used to evaluate levels of biodiversity in two adjacent coves, with different levels of exposure to iceberg scour [

The choice of sites and sampling regime enabled, not only the assessment of levels of biodiversity across the different size classes, but also the dissection of the drivers behind sediment community composition in this extreme environment and to identify whether they differed to those of temperate and tropical regions.
