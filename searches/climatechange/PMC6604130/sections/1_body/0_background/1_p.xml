<p id="Par13" class="p">Over 70% of the earth’s surface is ocean, with the vast majority of these sea floors covered in sediments. Thus, marine soft sediment communities are possibly the largest ecotype, and are arguably one of the dominant components of the earth’s biota. They also contribute significantly to marine ecosystem functioning [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">1</xref>], being key components of energy flow through food webs. They play important roles in sedimentary processes especially nutrient and carbon cycling, waste breakdown and removal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>]. In spite of this recognised importance, there are some areas of the globe where our knowledge of such communities, even in terms of the species living there, is poor. In these regions our confidence of predictions of future change is either low or not possible due to insufficient data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. This is particularly true of the polar regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. However such knowledge is critical, given that some of these areas, in particular the Arctic and Antarctic Peninsula, have experienced some of the most rapid rates of regional climate change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. Comprehensive base-line studies are required in these regions, which evaluate not only current levels of biodiversity across all organism size classes, but also the underlying ecological drivers that shape these communities. At the moment there is very little understanding as to whether the drivers that shape sediment communities in temperate and tropical regions are the same at the poles or, whether, the “extra” contributing ecological factors in the poles, which are currently changing, will impact soft sediment communities in the future.
