<p id="Par15" class="p">Until recently the few previous analyses of soft sediment communities in the Antarctic have concentrated on morpho-taxonomy of macro species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Even so, these have shown considerable levels of biodiversity, similar to that of temperate regions. Thus indicating that the general paradigm of increasing biodiversity from the poles to the tropics only holds for the Northern hemisphere, not the more evolutionary and geographically isolated Southern hemisphere [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>], but also that these communities respond differently to change when compared with the macrofauna [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>]. These latter studies have concentrated on colonization processes after ice shelf and glacier collapse, which analyse community progressions from extremely food-poor environments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>]. They may not accurately represent the responses, or rate of response, due to the inexorable consequences of a decrease in the duration of winter sea ice or gradual warming. Studies monitoring hard substrata communities in the bays around Rothera research base since 1997 have shown significant changes in species’ composition and structure over 7 years, which can be directly related to increased ice berg activity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, we currently have very few data, not only on how Antarctic soft sediment communities might be affected in the future, but also on the rate at which these communities respond to change, despite this being the dominant benthic habitat. This study provides data to fill this gap.
