<p id="Par25" class="p">The total number of ASVs assigned to Metazoan for the 18S rRNA and COI, was 189 and 249 respectively. Taxonomic composition using the 18S rRNA showed that the benthos is dominated by the nematodes, followed by Arthropods (namely crustaceans), Platyhelminthes and bivalves (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>: Table S4). The biggest proportional differences in ASVs were for crustaceans (19%) and platyhelminthes (4%) that were more abundant in South Cove and mollusca (19%) which were more abundant in Hangar Cove.
