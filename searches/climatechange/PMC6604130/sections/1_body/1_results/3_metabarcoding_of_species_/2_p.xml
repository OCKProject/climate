<p id="Par26" class="p">The frequency of shared versus unique ASVs showed that ca. 80% of ASVs were unique to one or other cove with only 20% of ASVs common to both coves. The majority of ASVs (1365) were assigned to non-metazoan phyla (Heterokonta, Alveolates, Rhizaria, together referred to as “SAR”). Taxonomic composition from the COI was mainly represented by Arthropods (49%) and Annelida (15%) (Additional file
