<p id="Par27" class="p">The metazoan ASV richness and diversity were higher than that recorded by morphotaxonomy (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>), with both recording a higher richness and diversity in South Cove than Hangar Cove (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref>). Similar to the patterns for morphotaxonomy, the two coves were clearly separated from each other by metabarcoding (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), with an average of 73% dissimilarity between the coves (ANOSIM). The main taxa responsible for these differences were nematodes (7 ASVs) and then rotifers (3 ASVs).
