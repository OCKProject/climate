<p id="Par29" class="p">The sediment properties at each site were characterised by poorly sorted (South Cove site C), or very poorly sorted sediment (all other sites) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref>; following the classification of [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">24</xref>]). This variation in grain size was greatest in Hangar Cove with sorting values of 2.87–3.17 ɸ compared to South Cove 1.03–2.65 ɸ. South Cove site C sediment was predominantly composed of sand. The sediment in Hangar Cove contained a much higher proportion of mud (13.3–19.9%) compared to South Cove (1.1–1.9%;
