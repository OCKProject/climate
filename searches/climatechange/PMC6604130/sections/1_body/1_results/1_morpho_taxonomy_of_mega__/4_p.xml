<p id="Par20" class="p">The average dissimilarity between Hangar Cove and South Cove was 53.7% (SIMPER). These differences were largely due to the dominance of the Molluscan bivalve family Montacutidae [represented by only one species, 
 <italic class="italic">Altenaeum charcoti</italic> (previously 
 <italic class="italic">Mysella charcoti</italic>)], which accounted for 13.2% of the total dissimilarity, the Cnidarian family Edwardsiidae (represented by only one genus 
 <italic class="italic">Edwardsia</italic>) at 6.6% and the Polychaete family Cirratulidae at 5.2%.
