<p id="Par39" class="p">While only five of the 51 samples in the current study had a known disturbance history, one of these was measured three times within the first 39Â days, which is within a similar time-frame over which reductions in biodiversity were measured in the hard substrata studies. Despite the small sample size the lack of any disturbance signal on our soft sediment sites was unexpected. This implies that icebergs may have less effect on soft sediment communities compared with those found on hard substrata. For example, it is likely that the sediment provides a cushion or softening effect against direct impacts and organism damage [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Organisms may also be redistributed via the wash from adjacent grounded icebergs, which means that meiofauna in sediments can redistribute very quickly, increasing the speed with which sediment patches can recover [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. Nematodes, which are one of the dominant taxa identified by metabarcoding, are little affected by disturbance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">45</xref>]. This is possibly due to easy redistribution from adjacent sites, which may contribute to their prevalence in soft sediments [
