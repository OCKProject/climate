 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. Both techniques recorded a lower species diversity and richness in Hangar Cove than South Cove. Morphotaxonomy also recorded a lower evenness as well as higher species dominance compared with South Cove. This trade-off between diversity and dominance matches the expectations of terrestrial ecological theory [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>], which is mirrored in other sediment studies across latitudes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>]. Both morphotaxonomy and metabarcoding recorded similar high levels of difference in species between the coves, with 54% dissimilarity in taxa identified through morphotaxonomy and approximately 80% of orders recorded from ASVs were unique to one or other cove. This matches with Sicinski et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>] whose comparison of two different glacial coves within Admiralty Bay, King George Island, found an 80–90% dissimilarity in species composition between their coves. Neither Hangar nor South Cove are glacial, but are similarly bounded on one side by ice cliffs and on the other by Rothera Point. The greater duration of winter sea ice cover in Hangar, rather than South, Cove may contribute to some of the differences between coves. The dynamics of the spring phytoplankton bloom are, however, set at a larger scale, that of Marguerite Bay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>] with both coves being bathed in the same water mass. Any future changes in primary productivity, due to changes in stratification or light intensity are therefore likely to affect both coves.
