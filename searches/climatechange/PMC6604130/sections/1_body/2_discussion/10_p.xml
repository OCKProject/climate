<p id="Par40" class="p">This is particularly pertinent to Hangar Cove, where one site was sampled within 7Â days of initial impact and this cove comprises a higher percentage of fine mud particles. Furthermore, some of the more dominant taxa identified in sediments, such as polychaetes and crustaceans, are highly mobile and thus rapidly recolonise impacted sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>]. Although there was no evidence of recent iceberg disturbance acting on the outlier sample from Hangar Cove, the high numbers of mobile scavengers (amphipods and urchins), and low numbers of the dominant infauna, means that an unidentified iceberg impact cannot be ruled out. Alternately, these species may have been attracted to a nearby food source, such as a carcass. Little is known about the life history traits of the smaller sediment-living species, but there is evidence that harsher environments select for more resilient R-selected species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. However, generation times are slowed in Antarctic species and the fauna are more generally K-selected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" class="xref">58</xref>]. The lack of variation suggests that they persist as a consequence of low temperatures, rather than rapid reproductive replacement, and hence this is a major difference to lower latitude, warmer sites.
