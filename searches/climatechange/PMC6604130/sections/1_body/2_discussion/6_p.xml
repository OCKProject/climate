<p id="Par36" class="p">The difference between methods is perhaps not surprising given the fact that different taxa are characteristic of the different size classes and thus the two techniques were complementary by showing several dominant taxa in the benthos. The latter finding is in agreement with previous studies on Antarctic meiobenthos using both morphotaxonomy and metabarcoding approaches [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">44</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>]. Additionally, the 18S rRNA is also known to have a slower molecular evolution rate making it a more valuable marker for distinguishing between samples at higher taxonomic levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>]. On the other hand the results from COI mitochondrial gene evidenced that arthropods and annelids also dominated the benthos, which coincides more closely with the morphological approach. This happens since the COI is widely used as a DNA barcode for species identification [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>] and because of this it has a high molecular resolution at the species level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" class="xref">47</xref>], although COI is not the most accurate marker for discriminating at higher taxonomic rankings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">49</xref>].
