<p id="Par31" class="p">This is the first study to comprehensively analyse the composition of Antarctic soft sediment metazoan communities across all size classes, from &lt; 1 mm up to 10 cm, in two geographically distinct coves. These data strongly confirm the few previous analyses that showed there were a wide range of densities of mega and macro-fauna recorded within Antarctic soft sediments, 464 to 16,084 individuals m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>, which match the wide range of densities recorded for other Antarctic and global locations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a; Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>: Table S3). There was a significant linear reduction in the density of individuals with increasing latitude (F
 <sub class="sub">(1,37)</sub> = 18.4, P &lt; 0.01) from Antarctic to Arctic sediments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a) with no significant difference between hemispheres (F
 <sub class="sub">(1,37)</sub> = 1.7, P = 0.21). This may be largely driven by the very high numbers of individuals recorded in McMurdo Sound sponge spicule beds [
