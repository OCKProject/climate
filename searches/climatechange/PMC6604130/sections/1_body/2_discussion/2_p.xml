 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). Values have been reported from as low as 8 m

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">27</xref>] to 650 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in East Greenland [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" class="xref">28</xref>]. Other values from the Antarctic also vary across a similar range, from 8 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in Admiralty Bay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>] to 469 m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup> in O’Brien Bay near Casey station [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>]. The addition of metabarcoding data shows that the inclusion of meiofauna greatly increased the richness measured. However, the morphotaxonomy data surprisingly reveal that the particular ecological drivers found in the Antarctic, namely seasonality and iceberg scour, had little effect on community composition, implying that similar to other regions of the world, organic content and sediment grain size are the major drivers of sediment biodiversity.
