 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) builds on CLM3.5 with the introduction of a carbon and nitrogen cycle model. CLM4 includes an option to run CLM4CN as a DGVM (CLM4‐CNDV), and the modules of DGVM follow the prior versions of CLM‐DGVM without major modifications. CNDV changes the CN framework only as needed to simulate biogeography updates, including light competition, establishment and survival, as well as mortality. All other ecosystem processes (such as individual allocation, phenology, and fire) are handled by CN (Castillo, Levis, &amp; Thornton,
