 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0057" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) was developed by the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, to investigate ecological processes and to study land–atmospheric interactions. It involves photosynthesis, respiration, phenology, individual carbon allocation, competition, survival and establishment, mortality, litter decomposition, soil respiration, and fire disturbance. IAP‐DGVM1.0 has been coupled with CLM (Oleson et al.,
