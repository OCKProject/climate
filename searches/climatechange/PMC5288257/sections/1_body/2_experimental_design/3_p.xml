<p class="p">In IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV, natural plants are classified into 12 PFTs according to their physical, phylogenetic, and phenological characteristics, including seven trees (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32735-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), two shrubs, and three grasses, in which trees have the highest hierarchy for the competition of establishment. Therefore, the simulation performance of tree PFTs has a direct influence on other PFT simulations, and this work mainly focused on how climate change influences forest coverage and its relevant variables using IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV. The definition of fractional coverage and related parameterizations is shown in Appendice S1.
