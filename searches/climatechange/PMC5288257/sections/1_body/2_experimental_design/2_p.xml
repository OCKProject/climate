<p class="p">Two types of global offline simulations were conducted: one using IAP‐DGVM coupled with CLM3 and the other using CLM4‐CNDV. All simulations were forced circularly with 50 years of reanalysis surface atmospheric fields (1950–1999) from Qian, Dai, Trenberth, and Oleson (

IAP‐DGVM ran for 800 years with T62 resolution (79 × 192 grid cells covering 60°S–90°N) to equilibrium and then restarted for another 50 years with the default atmospheric fields (control case) and climate change (i.e., with changes in temperature, precipitation, or CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration) in several separate cases: (1) temperature ±1°C, ±2°C, and ±3°C at each time step (abbreviated as mean annual temperature [MAT] ± 1°C, MAT ± 2°C, and MAT ± 3°C, respectively); (2) precipitation increased or decreased by 15% (abbreviated as MAP115 and MAP085); and (3) doubling the CO

 <sub class="sub">2</sub>). For CLM4‐CNDV, the 20th‐century control simulation documented by Bonan and Levis (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) (initial conditions supplied with the CCSM4 release) was used as the initial data to run CLM4‐CNDV for 600 years to equilibrium with 96 × 144 grid cells. The simulation was then restarted for the same ten cases with climate change and one control case, as IAP‐DGVM. The last 50 years of simulation results were analyzed. In each simulation, only one climate factor was changed, and the others remained at the default settings. For simplicity, variables from the control cases of the two models were marked “ctrl” in the subscript.
