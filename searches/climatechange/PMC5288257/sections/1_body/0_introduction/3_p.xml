<p class="p">Most projections of future climate change refer to temperature and precipitation changes, as well as increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Temperature is the main influencing factor of many ecosystem processes (Badeck et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) and the carbon balance. For example, Rustad et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>) used meta‐analysis to find that experimental warming of soil temperature in the range 0.3–6.0°C significantly increased soil respiration rate by 20%, net N mineralization rate by 46%, and plant productivity by 19%. Lin, Zhu, Wang, Gong, and Zou (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) analyzed gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production products during 2000–2010 and leaf area index (LAI; m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) products during 1981–2011 and found that the air temperature had a significant positive correlation with LAI (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .311) and GPP (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .189). Meanwhile, it has been discovered that the responses of ecosystems to temperature change are spatially heterogeneous and partly uncertain (Mekonnen, Grant, &amp; Schwalm, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Willis, Bennett, Burrough, Macias‐Fauria, &amp; Tovar, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Plenty of work has shown that because of temperature limitations, warming favors boreal forests in the form of increases in vegetation cover (Berner, Beck, Bunn, &amp; Goetz, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) and northward movement of tree lines. However, for some tropical forests, temperature has a strong negative effect on stem growth by increasing respiration and decreasing photosynthesis due to reduced stomatal conductance (Schippers, Sterck, Vlam, &amp; Zuidema, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Willis et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) concluded that when regional conditions become warmer and wetter, the biomass and range distribution of trees are likely to increase, while if a transition to warmer and drier conditions occurs, grass or savanna replaces woody vegetation in many regions.
