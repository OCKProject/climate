<p class="p">Precipitation is another vital factor, influencing tree growth (Subedi &amp; Sharma,

 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>). More precipitation during the wettest quarter increases tree diameter growth (Subedi &amp; Sharma, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), whereas reductions in photosynthesis occur during droughts, which decrease GPP (Schwalm et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Van der Molen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Wu, Dijkstra, Koch, Peñuelas, and Hungate (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) demonstrated that decreased precipitation suppressed aboveground biomass, whereas increased precipitation stimulated aboveground and belowground biomass. Moreover, the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration is the third factor related to climate change because it is expected to have a direct fertilization effect (Norby &amp; Zak, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) and lead to warming. Kimball (1983) had estimated that a doubling of the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, all else constant, will increase growth and yield approximately 34 ± 6% in C3 plants and 14 ± 11% in C4 plants. However, elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> does not always have a positive relationship with biomass and growth, and its fertilization effects partly depend on forest age (Körner et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>) and individual tree size (Kim, Oren, &amp; Qian, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
