<p class="p">Attention has been given to the relationship between terrestrial ecosystems and climate change and atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. However, much of the research has focused on the influences of climate change and/or atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on carbon fluxes or water cycles, and few work considered how climate change and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> influence the ecosystem structure (e.g., fractional coverage change) and which ecosystem types are susceptible to varying climate and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Such issues are very important because they have a direct impact on global biogeography, carbon and water cycles, vegetation succession, and the time scale of vegetation ecosystem recovery.
