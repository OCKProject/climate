<p class="p">In this work, two DGVMs (a revised version of IAP‐DGVM1.0 and CLM4‐CNDV) were used to investigate the responses of forest ecosystems to climate change with respect to changes in temperature, precipitation, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration. The following questions are addressed: (1) Which regions are sensitive to climate change? (2) When the temperature, precipitation, and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration vary, how do the forest area and fractional coverage change? (3) Which factor has larger influences on the change in
