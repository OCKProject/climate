In the temperature change sensitivity tests, it was shown that (1) the two models had different sensitive regions to temperature change, i.e., in IAP‐DGVM, the most sensitive areas were distributed in the core areas of forests, especially in boreal forests, while in CLM4‐CNDV, the most influenced regions were distributed in the transitional areas of boreal forests, the peripheral zones of tropical forests, and some semiarid or arid regions; (2) because warming led to stronger respiration and drier soil moisture,
