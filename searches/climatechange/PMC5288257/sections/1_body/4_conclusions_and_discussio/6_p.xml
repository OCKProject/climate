 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> appeared in the grid cells with 60% &lt;

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 80%. However, in CLM4‐CNDV, Δ

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 85% (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). In addition to the differences in GPP variance, due to the significant dependence of Δ

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub>, differences in the simulated 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> accounted for the discrepancies in Δ

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> between the two models. The results showed that excluding grid cells with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 5%, approximately 19.0% and 31.2% of the grid cells fell in the intervals

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &gt; 85% in IAP‐DGVM, whereas in CLM4‐CNDV, the percentages reached approximately 16.0% and 64.5%, respectively (Figure S2; to concentrate on the core areas of forests, only grid cells with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &gt; 5% were considered, and in the two models, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> is assumed not to exceed 95% in each grid cell; therefore, there were no results when 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 5% or 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &gt; 95%). The combination of the differences in the simulated

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and the dependence of Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> largely accounted for the differences in Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> and its standard deviation in these two models.
