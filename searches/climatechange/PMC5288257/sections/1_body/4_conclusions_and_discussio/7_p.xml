<p class="p">As discussed in previous research, the responses of forest ecosystems are spatially heterogeneous and partly uncertain (Mekonnen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>; Williams et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Willis et al., 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0053" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). To further investigate the differences in the response of forest ecosystems to temperature change in different regions, the optimal temperature change (relative to the current temperature) was defined as temperature condition in the seven temperature sensitivity tests under which

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> was the largest. Only grid cells with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> greater than 1% were considered. Large discrepancies existed in the global distribution of the optimal temperature between IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0011" ref-type="fig" class="xref">11</xref>). In IAP‐DGVM, most boreal forests had their largest

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> at MAT + 3°C, while for some boreal regions, the optimal temperature conditions were MAT − 1°C, MAT, or MAT + 2°C. In accordance with Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a, temperate and tropical forests benefited from decreased temperature in IAP‐DGVM, and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> reached the maximum value when MAT decreased by 3°C. For CLM4‐CNDV, the advantage of warming appeared in a smaller range of boreal forests, consistent with Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b, and the maximum 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> was reached at MAT − 2°C, MAT − 1°C or MAT in many boreal grid cells. In the arid and semiarid regions (e.g., the western USA) and transitional zones of forests (e.g., the peripheral areas of the tropical rainforests in Central Africa), decreased temperature was good for forest coverage, and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> was largest at MAT − 3°C because cooling relieved drought or reduced respiration, decreasing tree mortality in these regions, which was somewhat in accordance with Williams et al. (
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0052" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). The tropical forests in CLM4‐CNDV mostly had the largest 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> in the case of MAT + 3°C; however, due to 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> being close to the upper 95% limit provided in the models, the increment of 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> was small in these areas.
