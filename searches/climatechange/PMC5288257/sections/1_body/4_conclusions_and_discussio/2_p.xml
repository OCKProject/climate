<p class="p">Forests are particularly vulnerable to changing environmental conditions due to the longevity of tree species (Kräuchi, 
 <xref rid="ece32735-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). However, climate change effects on forests may also be subtle, affecting individual tree growth and forest composition and structure from years to decades (Pederson et al.,
