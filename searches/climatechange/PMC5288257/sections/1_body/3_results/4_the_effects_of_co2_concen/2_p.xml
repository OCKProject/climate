<p class="p">Changes in the carbon dioxide level have attracted attention because increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration not only results in global warming but also increases carbon fertilization. In this work, increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> does not lead to rising temperature, i.e., only carbon fertilization effects were considered. Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0010" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref> shows the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and area‐averaged Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> in the sensitivity tests with doubled concentration (2CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) simulated by IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV. It was shown that (1) the simulated 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> in the two models had a positive response to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration; (2) when doubling the CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration, ecosystems with 35% &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 40% had the strongest sensitivity to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> change, Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> reached approximately 12% and 14% for IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV, respectively.
