<p class="p">In the responses of 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> to MAP change, CLM4‐CNDV also had larger Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> than IAP‐DGVM (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0008" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8</xref>). When increasing MAP by 15%, larger Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> occurred in areas with approximately 30% &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> &lt; 80% in both models. However, in the case of decreasing MAP, obvious Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> appeared in the grid cells with approximately 20% &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> &lt; 45% in IAP‐DGVM, while the sensitive regions were areas with approximately 60% &lt;

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> &lt; 85% in CLM4‐CNDV.
