<p class="p">Similarly, to further investigate the influences of MAP and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> on Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub>, the correlation coefficients between Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub>, as well as MAP, were calculated (see Appendices S4 and S5). In the same way, normalization of MAP (mm/year; i.e., MAP′ = MAP/MAP
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, where MAP
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was the maximum value of MAP around the globe) was performed before regression. Furthermore, Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> were used in decimal form rather than percentages (%).Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> had a significant relationship with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .0001) and MAP′ (
 <italic class="italic">p </italic>&lt; .0001), especially with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub>, for both IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV. Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> in the case of increasing MAP had greater dependence on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> than cases with decreasing MAP (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .377 vs. .191 in IAP‐DGVM; 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = .181 vs. .154 in CLM4‐CNDV). Additionally, the Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> simulated by IAP‐DGVM had much stronger sensitivity to 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and MAP′ than in the CLM4‐CNDV simulations. The relationship between the standard deviation of Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> was also considered. Similar to the cases of temperature change, σ in CLM4‐CNDV was generally larger than that in IAP‐DGVM for most forest ecosystems when MAP changed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0009" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9</xref>). For IAP‐DGVM, σ in the case of decreasing MAP was higher than σ in the case of increasing MAP for all groups of forest ecosystems, especially regions with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> ~ 70%. However, for CLM4‐CNDV, grid cells with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 48% had larger σ in the case of increasing MAP (except for areas with 25% &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 36%), especially with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> ~ 40%, whereas in the decreasing MAP sensitivity test, higher σ occurred in regions with 70% &lt; 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> &lt; 82%.
