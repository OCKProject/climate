<p class="p">Temperature change may result in changes in forest ecosystem structures due to changes in GPP and population dynamics among different PFTs. In IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV, there are seven tree PFTs, and different forest types are often expected to have various sensitivities to climate change. To explore how different tree PFTs respond to temperature change, the simulated changes in global area (ΔΩ; km
