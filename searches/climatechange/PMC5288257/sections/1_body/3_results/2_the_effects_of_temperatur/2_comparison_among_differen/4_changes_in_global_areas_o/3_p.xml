<p class="p">In the two models, temperature increase had a negative impact on the global areas of NEM‐Tr and BEM‐Tr (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b,e). For the third temperate tree PFT, BDM‐Tr, the two models had opposite performance to warming (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>g). Meanwhile, for BET‐Tr and BDT‐Tr, the dominant tree PFTs in tropical forests, the responses of their global areas to temperature changes were totally distinct between two models. In IAP‐DGVM, both BET‐Tr's Ω and BDT‐Tr's Ω had positive responses to decreasing temperature and negative relationships with warming, while in CLM4‐CNDV, the results were opposite (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d,f). It was probably because of differences in population dynamics schemes and photosynthesis parameterizations between models.
