<p class="p">Overall, for two models, warming resulted in a reduction in the total area of trees around the globe, while cooling led to a slight increment in global area of trees, except in the case of MAT − 3°C for CLM4‐CNDV (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a). Furthermore, warming had a larger impact on the ΔΩ for trees than cooling. For boreal forests (NEB‐Tr and BDB‐Tr), warming consistently decreased their global areas (Ω; km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) in the two models (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c,h). When MAT declined, the Ωs of NEB‐Tr and BDB‐Tr from IAP‐DGVM decreased; however, in CLM4‐CNDV, cooling reduced NEB‐Tr's Ω (except in the case with MAT − 1°C) but increased BDB‐Tr's Ω. The combination of changes in the Ωs of NEB‐Tr and BDB‐Tr led to a reduction in boreal forest areas in both the two models.
