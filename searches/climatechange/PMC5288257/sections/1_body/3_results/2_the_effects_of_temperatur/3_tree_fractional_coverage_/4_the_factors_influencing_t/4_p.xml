<p class="p">Compared with IAP‐DGVM, Δ

 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> in CLM4‐CNDV varied over a wide range, especially for forest ecosystems with

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> ~ (25%, 85%; Figure

 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> for the two models, the relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and global area‐averaged standard deviation of Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> (σ; %) was analyzed (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The results showed that forest ecosystems simulated by CLM4‐CNDV usually had larger σ when the temperature varied. Except for the case with 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> at approximately 70%, σ from IAP‐DGVM was almost less than 5%, while in the CLM4‐CNDV cases, the maximum σ reached approximately 15% (

 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> ~ 25%) and 20% (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> ~ 85%) for warming and cooling, respectively (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). These differences may be due to the larger change in ΔGPP in CLM4‐CNDV.
