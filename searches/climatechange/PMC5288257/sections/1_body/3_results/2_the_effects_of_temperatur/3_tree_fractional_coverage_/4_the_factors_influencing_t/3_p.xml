<p class="p">To quantitatively explain the dependence of Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> on MAT and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub>, the correlation coefficient (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>) was calculated (see Appendices S2 and S3). Because Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> demonstrates that whether Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> was positive or negative largely depended on the MAT value, the simulation results were classified into two groups based on the MAT value (&gt;0 or &lt;0) for each case. Grid cells with an absolute value of MAT (|MAT|) less than 1°C in the control simulations were excluded from the analysis. Three regression equations were used to describe the separate and combined effects of MAT and/or 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> on Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub>. Normalization of MAT (MAT′; −1 ≤ MAT′ ≤ 1) was performed before regression, i.e., MAT′ = MAT/|MAT|
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>, where |MAT|
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was the maximum absolute value of MAT around the globe. Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> were used in decimal form rather than as percentages (%). There were similar phenomena in the IAP‐DGVM and CLM4‐CNDV simulation results, i.e., for the two models: (1) In all the cases, although Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub> had a significant relationship with MAT′ (all cases had 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .0001 except one case with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; .01), it was more dependent on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub>. For example, in the IAP‐DGVM simulations, when MAT decreased by 1°C, in areas with MAT &lt;  0, MAT′ accounted for approximately 22.9% of the variation in Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub>, while 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> explained approximately 62.4% of the variation in Δ
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree</sub>, and the combined effects of MAT′ and 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> were approximately 64.2%; (2) when warming, grid cells with MAT ≥ 0 were more sensitive to 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and MAT′ because regions with MAT ≥ 0 had larger 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> than grid cells with MAT &lt; 0 in regression Equation 1; on the other hand, when MAT decreased, forest ecosystems with MAT &lt; 0 usually had strong responses to temperature and forest structure. Moreover, it was shown that forest ecosystems described by IAP‐DGVM were more dependent on 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">tree,ctrl</sub> and MAT′ (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> from IAP‐DGVM was larger than that from CLM4‐CNDV for the same cases). For MAT ± 2°C or MAT ± 3°C, similar conclusions were obtained, so the results are not shown here.
