<p class="p">The case of cooling had similar sensitive areas to the case of warming, except some areas of Europe and the core areas of tropical rainforests (e.g., the center of the Amazon and Indonesian islands) in IAP‐DGVM (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a vs. b). Opposite to warming, temperate and tropical forests benefited from cooling in the IAP‐DGVM simulation, and the

 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b), in accordance with the conclusion in Figure

 <xref rid="ece32735-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c vs. d). Furthermore, in the cooling experiments, although the sensitive area in CLM4‐CNDV was smaller, the amplitude of Δ
