   <bold class="bold">(A)</bold> Five outlier SNPs (a-e, FDR q &lt; 0.001) are labeled on a plot of the neutral per site temporal F
   <sub class="sub">ST</sub> distribution (modern versus historic) estimated by OutFLANK. The histogram of observed F
   <sub class="sub">ST</sub> (yellow bins) is shown with the inferred neutral distribution (blue line). 
   <bold class="bold">(B)</bold> Unfolded two-dimensional site frequency spectrum (2D-SFS) for SNPs between historic (x-axis) and modern (y-axis) YNP 
   <italic class="italic">Tamias alpinus</italic> specimens. The color of each data point represents the number of SNPs (depicted by the color key) belonging to that particular 2D-SFS category. Arrows point to the five outliers (a-e) showing the only significant allele frequency shifts over time. 
   <bold class="bold">(C)</bold> Derived allele frequencies of the five outliers SNPs plotted against sample elevation. Individual sample localities were pooled into 100-meter elevational bands to enable allele frequency estimation. 
   <bold class="bold">(D)</bold> The position of the five outliers mapped onto the 
   <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic> gene in the 
   <italic class="italic">Mus musculus</italic> reference genome. SNP ‘a’ is a synonymous mutation (A/G) in exon 2 (Chromosome 11:70350801); SNP ‘b’ is synonymous (T/C) and maps to exon 8 (11:70347260); SNPs ‘c’ (T/A), ‘d’ (T/G), and ‘e’ (T/G) are located in the intron between exon 8 and 9.
