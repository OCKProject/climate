 <p class="p">Museum specimens represent an irreplaceable archive that can be used to understand how species respond to rapid environmental change. We recovered genomic data from archived samples spanning a century of climate change in co-distributed declining versus stable species of montane chipmunks. Applying novel statistical methods, we find evidence for strong positive selection on a physiologically relevant gene despite increased population fragmentation in the declining species. Our results reveal rapid evolutionary responses, but also highlight that genetic adaptation has been insufficient to prevent range collapse in this endemic alpine species. These findings illustrate how biological archives can be used to pinpoint genetic responses through time to better understand how species are responding to rapidly changing environments.</p>
