<p class="p">These results emphasize the utility of high-resolution demographic inference from genomic data not only for reconstructing population histories, but also as a potentially powerful conservation management tool [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. An ABC framework is generalizable to other temporally sampled genetic datasets, allowing high-resolution inference into demographic histories over shallow evolutionary timescales that are relevant to recent anthropogenic climate change. In species of conservation concern, signatures of reduced migration could be used to motivate introductions between populations prior to significant genetic erosion, buffering against the future loss of genetic diversity and the accumulation of deleterious variation [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>]. The benefits of such proactive efforts would have to be weighed carefully relative to the potential risks of introducing locally maladaptive variation [
