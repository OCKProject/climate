However, disentangling changes in migration versus local effective population size, and identifying genes under positive selection in the context of recent demographic change, requires more comprehensive analyses. Therefore, we developed a novel analytical framework to fully exploit our temporal dataset. Traditional population genetic analyses often assume even sampling across space and time, yet studies using museum specimens are typically imbalanced because of limited availability of samples. ABC is well suited for demographic inference under such circumstances because biased temporal sampling and sample processing can be simulated for populations that have experienced complex demographic histories. Accordingly, simulations can be filtered in the same way as observed data (e.g., removal of SNPs associated with errors in historic DNA), permitting meaningful comparisons between expected and observed results. A major difficulty of ABC is the choice of statistics that sufficiently describe demographic parameters of interest. Multiple, jointly informative, summary statistics are often used to sufficiently estimate parameters while reducing the risk of any particular statistic biasing the results [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. The site frequency spectrum (SFS) is often an optimal choice for fitting demographic histories since many commonly used summary statistics can be derived from it. In practice, high dimensionality and low count categories of joint site frequency spectra make them difficult to fit. Consequently, we developed an effective means of fitting binned two-dimensional SFS (2D-SFS) using an ABC framework designed to infer population histories from serially sampled metapopulations (
