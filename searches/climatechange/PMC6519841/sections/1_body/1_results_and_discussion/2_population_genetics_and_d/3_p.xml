 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], we next tested to what extent similar temporal signatures of increased genetic structure were apparent in SS populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Population structure in the SS transect has also increased (F
 <sub class="sub">ST,historic</sub> = 0.034, F
 <sub class="sub">ST,modern</sub> = 0.044), but to a lesser extent than observed in YNP, and with no overall increase in the number of distinct genetic groups (modern and historic K = 2; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). This suggests some variation in the local genetic consequences of seemingly synchronous, range-wide contractions. However, we note that our power to detect changes in overall population structure may have been limited by the fact that historic and modern sampling localities were more spatially clustered in SS when compared to YNP (
