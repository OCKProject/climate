<p class="p">We constructed 2D-SFS for each of the three pairwise temporal contrasts by pooling individuals across sampling localities within YNP or SS into a single metapopulation per time period (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s006" class="xref">S5 Fig</xref>). While allele frequencies should be highly correlated over such short time scales, the overall shape of the joint spectrum should change in predictable ways in response to various population-level processes. We fitted multiple demographic models to the 2D-SFS (

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> was characterized by relatively small but constant deme effective sizes through time (~1,350 individuals) and an approximately threefold decrease in migration within the past ~90 years (
