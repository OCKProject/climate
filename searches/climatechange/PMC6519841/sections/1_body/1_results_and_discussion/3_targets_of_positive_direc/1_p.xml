<p class="p">Connections between broad ecological patterns and the genetic structure of populations are often intuitive and predictable. Upwards range contraction in

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> is associated with reduced connectivity between suitable montane habitats [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] are both consistent with stronger directional selection gradients in YNP and SS

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> relative to

 <italic class="italic">speciosus</italic>. On the other hand, lower effective population sizes and reduced migration (at least in YNP) should make selection relatively less effective in

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic>. Likewise, more effective adaptive responses could explain why larger and more connected populations of
