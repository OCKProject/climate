<p class="p">To begin to tease these issues apart, we tested for specific genetic changes that might underlie recent adaptive responses in these species by directly comparing genetic differences between historic and modern populations. All three temporal population pairs are very closely related (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g002" class="xref">Fig 2</xref>), however, they are also separated by changes in population structure and sizes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>) that may confound standard signatures of positive selection [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>]. Therefore, we tested for individual SNPs that had undergone large frequency shifts between historic and modern populations using an approach that is robust to the confounding influence of complex population histories on the genomic distribution of F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. We found no significant allele frequency shifts over time in YNP

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic>. In contrast, we identified five outlier SNPs in YNP

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> populations (false discovery rate [FDR] q-value &lt; 0.01) relative to the inferred null distribution of per-site, genome-wide F

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g004" class="xref">Fig 4A</xref>). To verify the inference of positive selection on these SNPs, we compared the observed F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values to null distributions simulated under the best ABC-fitted demographic history for YNP

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). Our simulated F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> distributions were in close agreement with the overall observed F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values. Thus, it is very unlikely that demography alone could produce the extreme changes in allele frequencies that we observed at the outlier loci (p-value &lt; 3e-7;
