<p class="p">In principle, the large shift in 
 <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic> allele frequencies observed between historic and modern samples could be driven by changes in habitats, food availability, or some other non-climate related environmental factor. However, based on previous modeling of changes in the elevational range [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and the function of 
 <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic>, we suggest that physiological response to warming is the strongest current hypothesis. Winter temperature appears to be a primary limiting factor in the distribution of

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Increases in minimum winter temperatures at mid-elevations are resulting in reduced YNP snowpacks [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref060" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">60</xref>], which Rubidge and colleagues suggested might reduce over-winter survival of

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>]. Interestingly, arousal from hibernation has been shown to induce oxidative stress and hypoxia [
