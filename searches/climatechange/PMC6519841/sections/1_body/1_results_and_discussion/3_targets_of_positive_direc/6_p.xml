<p class="p">A potential link between the intensity of selection on variation at 
 <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic> and changes in winter snowpack could also explain why we did not detect selection at the same gene in the SS transect. 
 <italic class="italic">Tamias alpinus</italic> populations in the Southern Sierra are fixed for ancestral alleles at all but one of the outlier YNP SNPs, suggesting that these populations may lack genetic variation at 
 <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic> that is putatively adaptive in YNP. Moreover, SS 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> populations are currently found above ~3200 meters—above the elevation range showing the largest allele frequency shifts in YNP—and overall snowpack has been more stable in the southern Sierra during the last century [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref059" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Though speculative, these scenarios help illustrate how evolutionary responses among populations may depend on both adaptive potential (i.e., standing genetic variation) and local environmental conditions.
