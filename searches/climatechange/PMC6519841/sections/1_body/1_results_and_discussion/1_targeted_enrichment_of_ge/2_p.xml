Analysis of mitochondrial DNA indicated that empirical error rates were ~fourfold higher in historic (0.16%) versus modern samples (0.04%), due primarily to DNA damage typical of century-old museum samples [

All filters were uniformly applied to historic, modern, and simulated data (see below) to facilitate comparisons across time periods and species. After filtering, we identified 20,395, 10,395, and 10,954 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in YNP
