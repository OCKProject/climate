<p class="p">High sequencing coverage is necessary to reliably genotype ancient DNA samples [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>] due to extensive DNA degradation [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. This persistent technical challenge makes whole genome resequencing of historic mammalian populations impractical, especially in species without high-quality reference genomes (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Tamias</italic>). Therefore, we designed a custom targeted capture to enrich and sequence exons from over 10,107 protein-coding genes (9.4 Megabases or Mb total) in 294 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">speciosus</italic> samples (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s011" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>) and nine samples from four other chipmunk species (total n = 303). We sampled geographic transects of modern and historic (~100 year-old) populations in YNP for both species as well as an independent SS transect of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic>, where this species has also contracted [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. An average of 49 individuals were sequenced per population (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen.1008119.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). This design allowed us to (i) compare stable and retracting species within the same montane mammal community (YNP), and to (ii) determine to what extent the same evolutionary responses have occurred across two transects (YNP and SS) spanning the latitudinal range of the range-retracted species
