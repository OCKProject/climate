<p class="p">We used RNA-seq [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>] to sequence and assemble [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref069" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">69</xref>] transcriptomes for multiple tissues sampled from a single modern SS 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> to serve as a reference for exome capture probe design. We targeted exonic regions (6.9 Mb, including flanking introns and intergenic regions) corresponding to 8,053 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> genes targeted by our previous array-based capture experiments in chipmunks [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref070" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>]. In addition, we extracted a broad set of candidate genes from the AmiGO and NCBI protein databases with functional annotations that were potentially relevant to environmental stress responses (e.g., HSP/HSF, hemoglobin, cytokines, apoptosis, immunity, oxidative stress, oxidative phosphorylation). We then used a BLASTx search against these genes to locate 2,054 orthologous transcripts (2.4 Mb) from the 
 <italic class="italic">Tamias</italic> transcriptome and included these transcripts in our capture. We also targeted the complete mitochondrial genome (~16.4 Kb) to assess empirical error rates and five previously sequenced nuclear genes [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>] to use as positive controls in post-capture qPCR assays of global enrichment efficiency. Probes were designed and manufactured by NimbleGen (SeqCap EZ Developer kits).
