<p class="p">Barcoded genomic libraries were pooled together and hybridized in seven independent reactions with 
 <italic class="italic">Tamias</italic> Cot-1 DNA and barcode-specific blocking oligonucleotides. Six hybridization experiments were used for the focal species (one per time point for each of the three temporal contrasts) and one additional capture was performed on pooled libraries from six 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">minimus</italic> and three outgroup samples (
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">striatus</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ruficaudus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">amoenus</italic>). After hybridization, each of the enriched genomic libraries were amplified using PCR and sequenced using one lane of Illumina HiSeq2000 per capture (100-bp paired-end).
