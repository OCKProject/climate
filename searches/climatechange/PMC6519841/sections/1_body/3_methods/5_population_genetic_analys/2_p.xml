<p class="p">Next we developed an ABC framework for fitting binned 2D-SFS from serially sampled populations or metapopulations (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s005" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>) and used this approach to test hypotheses about the demographic histories of the sampled chipmunk populations. Additional details on demographic model construction, simulations, model selection, and inference are provided in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s001" class="xref">S1 Text</xref>. Briefly, we fitted 5â€“9 explicit demographic models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s007" class="xref">S6 Fig</xref>) characterized by possible changes in migration and population size to each of the temporal contrasts. We performed 25,000 simulations per model, drawing parameter values from uniform or log-uniform prior distributions and then simulating ~20.2 Mb of sequence data for each individual under the specified history using the coalescent simulator fastsimcoal [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref083" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Lineages from the different demes were sampled at the present (modern sample) and 90 generations in the past (historic sample) according to the actual number of sampled individuals. Then all samples within a respective time period were pooled and the historic versus modern 2D-SFS was calculated. A custom script was used to calculate diagonal and off diagonal bins of the joint SFS (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s005" class="xref">S4 Fig</xref>), which served as our ABC summary statistic. We used the R package 'abc' [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref084" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">84</xref>] to calculate model posterior probabilities and to evaluate the reliability of our model selection procedure. We considered the best fitting models for each species/transect to be those with the highest posterior probabilities (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s017" class="xref">S7 Table</xref>) and we used a cross validation procedure to determine error rates associated with model choice (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s018" class="xref">S8 Table</xref>). To aid model choice, we also considered the fit of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate for each model to our observed data. We evaluated goodness-of-fit for the selected models by comparing the Euclidean distance between our observed and simulated 2D-SFS bins (
