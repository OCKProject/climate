<p class="p">We used probabilistic methods for variant discovery and allele frequency estimation as implemented within ANGSD [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Using a population-specific SFS estimated from allele frequency likelihoods as a prior, we obtained allele frequency posterior probabilities and called SNPs using a 0.95 probability cutoff of being variable. The realSFS function was used to generate 1,000 bootstrap replicates of the folded site frequency spectrum (SFS) for each metapopulation by resampling per site allele frequency likelihoods. We then used ANGSD to estimate the number of segregating sites (S), Watterson's theta (θ
 <sub class="sub">W</sub>), pairwise nucleotide diversity (θπ), and Tajima's 
 <italic class="italic">D</italic> in the historic and modern 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">speciosus</italic> metapopulations. For each metapopulation, we generated 100 estimates of θ
 <sub class="sub">W</sub> and θπ using randomly chosen SFS bootstrap replicates as priors to evaluate sensitivity of these point estimates on the SFS prior. Additionally we estimated diversity statistics for demes within metapopulations, the former representing spatially clustered sampling localities. For each transect, population differentiation within and between the modern and historic populations was determined using probabilistic methods for estimating F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>] and individual covariance matrices for principal component analysis (PCA) as implemented in ngsTools [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref080" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">80</xref>]. Confidence intervals (0.95) for global F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> were generated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates of per-site F
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> values. To compare allele frequencies over time, we estimated the 2D-SFS between the pooled modern and pooled historic demes of each transect (i.e., three 2D-SFS comparisons). SNPs identified in

 <italic class="italic">speciosus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> were polarized relative to

 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">ruficaudus</italic>, and

 <italic class="italic">amoenus</italic>. We further examined population genetic structure using NGSadmix [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], which estimates admixture proportions from genotype likelihoods. We ran 10 replicates for 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> (number of clusters) ranging from 1–10 and summarized results (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1008119.s015" class="xref">S5 Table</xref>) across runs to determine the best

 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">minimus</italic> samples, we used the program ADMIXTURE [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>] to estimate individual ancestries using one randomly sampled SNP per contig.
