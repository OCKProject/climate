<p class="p">The identification of targets of positive selection during the recent upslope range contraction in 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> points to a candidate gene and potential phenotypes associated with physiological stress that warrant further study. We caution that further evidence, such as differences in over-winter survival across genotypes or other functional studies, are necessary to demonstrate a causal relationship between 
 <italic class="italic">Alox15</italic> and response to climatic-induced stress. Further, our capture experiment only covered a subset of protein coding genes (~50%) and did not include extensive coverage of regulatory regions that may often modulate rapid evolutionary responses [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. That said, alpine chipmunks also show greater stress response to changes in external conditions [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>], a narrower range of activity patterns [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>], and more pronounced shifts in diet and functional aspects of cranial morphology when compared to 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">speciosus</italic> over the past century [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. Thus, the combination of phenotypic, behavioral, and now genetic evidence points to some component of physiological stress as a key factor in the greater sensitivity of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">alpinus</italic> to environmental change.
