 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Here we have begun to extend these ideas to a comparative population genomic framework. Moving forward, we suggest that the true power of analyzing genomes and phenotypes of historical museum archives lies in the potential to extend across species [

Though the occurrence of museum records tend to be highly punctuated through space and time for a given species, historic collection efforts, such as those led by Joseph Grinnell and other early naturalists, usually surveyed many co-distributed species. With comparable contemporary sampling efforts, these invaluable archives will enable comparative community level insights into the impacts of and evolutionary responses to rapidly changing environments.
