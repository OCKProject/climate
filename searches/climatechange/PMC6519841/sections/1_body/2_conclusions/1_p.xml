 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>] by generating targeted genome-wide sequence data from 294 chipmunks spanning a century of climate change. By integrating high throughput sequencing, cost and time-effective targeted enrichment technologies, and sophisticated inference methods, we provide powerful comparative insights into demographic and evolutionary responses of two montane species experiencing rapid environmental change. Our genomic time-series approach demonstrates one way that historical archives can be used to study biological responses during recent environmental change [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Temporal genomic data can provide a means to understand the current state of populations and their potential evolutionary trajectories, providing powerful tools to inform the conservation of populations experiencing changing environments.
