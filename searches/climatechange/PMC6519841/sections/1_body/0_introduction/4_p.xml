<p class="p">These two species set up a natural contrast, allowing us to understand how differing ecological responses during periods of rapid environmental change correspond to differing evolutionary responses. A previous temporal survey of eight microsatellite markers revealed increased subdivision and declining allelic diversity in YNP

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] used a custom exon capture platform to enrich and sequence ~11,000 exons (~4 Megabases or Mb across 6,249 protein-coding genes) from 20 early 20

These genome-wide data confirmed signatures of increasing population subdivision in this retracting species and illustrated the potential for targeted genomic experiments to generate high quality data from archived specimens. However, neither of these preceding analyses had sufficient sampling to determine whether evident increases in population structure were due to reductions in local population size, migration rates, or both.
