 <sup class="sup">th</sup> century and modern museum surveys, Moritz and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>] showed that the ranges of several high elevation small mammal species in the Yosemite National Park (YNP) region of the Sierra Nevada mountains (California, USA) have retracted upward over the past century. This and associated studies [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] demonstrated the potential of using museum archives to understand species and community-level ecological responses during periods of recent climate change. Contemporary range shifts towards higher latitudes, elevations, or both have now been documented in many terrestrial species [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. However, these works have also highlighted that closely related species can differ markedly in the magnitude and direction of their ecological responses, for reasons that are often not clear [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. Currently, we know very little about how recent range shifts have affected evolutionary processes within species, or the extent to which evolutionary genetic responses have been synchronous within and between co-distributed species.
