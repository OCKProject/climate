 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Although phenotypic plasticity may enable populations to track rapidly changing climates, evolutionary adaptation will often be essential for long-term persistence [
 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Disentangling plasticity from evolutionary responses ultimately requires resolving the genetic basis of adaptation. However, it remains challenging to differentiate recent or ongoing positive selection from stochastic genetic drift in contemporary populations that are also undergoing extreme demographic changes [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Natural history museum collections may hold the key to overcoming many of these difficulties by providing crucial temporal information on species distributions, phenotypes, and population genetic variation spanning periods of recent environmental change [

 <xref rid="pgen.1008119.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Temporal genomic contrasts have begun to yield powerful insights into recent evolutionary responses in humans [
