 <italic class="italic">P. lividus</italic> is extremely rare. In hundreds of dives that are part of very extensive benthic surveys of coastal rocky reefs between the years 2010–2014 in northern Israel (along 80 Km of coastline including inside an active marine reserve in Rosh Hanikra, and on reefs in Haifa Bay and the Carmel coast area), a total of 19 individuals were found

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref>. Although there is no pre-collapse long-term density dataset, numerous discussions with fishermen, divers and researchers suggest that this species was still common until the early-2000’s, and its populations have collapsed over the past ca. 15 years. It is important to note that there are indications suggesting that 
 <italic class="italic">P. lividus</italic> populations along the Lebanese and Syrian coastline are also declining
