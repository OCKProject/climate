 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>, but infection was also associated with unusually low wave height, and as a result, the mortality was limited to the intertidal populations and to that specific extreme event. Although we did not observe any external morbidity symptoms, such as spots, lesions, failure to hold spines erect and spine loss in the present work, we cannot rule out the possibility that temperature-induced disease may be the mechanism behind the discussed 
 <italic class="italic">P. lividus</italic> population collapse. Deciphering this will require further study.
