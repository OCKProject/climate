<p class="p">Marginal seas like the Mediterranean may be especially susceptible to climate change impacts
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. Previous assessments suggested that the Mediterranean Sea has indeed been highly affected by global warming through sea surface temperature (SST) increase of about 1 °C between the years 1974–2004
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. This trend is expected to continue and water temperature has been projected to rise by up to 3.1 °C towards the end of this century

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. Evidence from recent acute (~3 °C) but short warming periods (following exceptional heat waves) in the northwestern Mediterranean over the past 20 years demonstrated that high rise in temperatures often leads to mass mortality events. These events were not limited to local areas, as sessile organisms (mainly corals and sponges) along thousands of kilometers of coastline were affected
