<p class="p">The question of how to tackle the ecological determinants of health is poised to become the signature public health issue of the coming decade in South Africa, in much the same way that HIV took centre stage in the preceding decades. Rapid environmental changes are creating observable effects in multiple domains, from air quality, temperature and weather patterns, to food security and disease burden [
