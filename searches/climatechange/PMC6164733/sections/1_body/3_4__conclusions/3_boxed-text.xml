  </title>
  <p class="p">1. Examine the interface between climate change and HIV,
   identifying possibilities for a joined-up, synergistic, evidence-based
   response to climate-HIV interactions.</p>
  <p class="p">2. Attribution and detection studies that use long-term,
   multi-decadal climate data to document and project long-term trends in health
   outcomes. Most such work has focused on malaria, with substantial gaps in
   data on diarrheal diseases, for example. Predicting other emerging infectious
   diseases with more complex environmental determinants remains a significant
   challenge.</p>
  <p class="p">3. Document the heat impacts on vulnerable groups, such
   as infants and the elderly, and interactions between heat and poor air
   quality in occupational and domestic settings.</p>
  <p class="p">4. Understand heat exposure in occupational settings in
   South Africa and develop interventions to reduce health-health, especially
   for miners, agricultural workers and those providing outdoor services.</p>
  <p class="p">5. Investigate the effects of climate change on mental
   health, especially among vulnerable population groups.</p>
  <p class="p">6. Identify the indirect impacts of a changing climate on
   food security and other social determinants of health.</p>
