<p class="p">It is significant that very few studies were identified in our review used empirical data from health services to analyze the impact of climate change. More effective use of surveillance and research data are required to monitor climate change impacts on human health in South Africa, and to then bring these findings to the attention of policy makers and the public. The considerable human resources dedicated to health research in the country have yet to turn their attention to climate change [

Notably, the review included only one qualitative research paper [
