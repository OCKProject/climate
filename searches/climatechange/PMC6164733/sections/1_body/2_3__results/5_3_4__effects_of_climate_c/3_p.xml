<p class="p">Extreme weather conditions will have considerable impacts on those who depend on climate-sensitive resources and ecosystems for their livelihoods. Soil drying, coupled with irregular rainfall caused by rising temperatures, particularly in the western regions of South Africa [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], constrains agricultural production. This is potentially most harmful for subsistence farming communities who are already prone to geopolitical and economic marginalization. Rainfall shortages, higher temperatures and reduced soil moisture have all been associated with internal migration in the country [
 <xref rid="B81-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">81</xref>]. This is especially true of communities that are highly dependent on natural resources for their livelihood (e.g., firewood, seeds and wild foods) [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Movement to vulnerable inner-city areas and informal settlements is particularly concerning as these areas have the highest risks of HIV transmission [

 <xref rid="B82-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. These patterns, termed eco-migration, can accentuate the already high levels of urbanization in the country. Of note, migration carries increased risks of sexual violence for women and some female migrants in South Africa may have few options for survival other than sex work [
 <xref rid="B83-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">83</xref>]. Eco-migration also erodes social networks—the practical and emotional resources underpinning health and well-being—and has fomented conflict in sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. The potential for this to happen also in South Africa is high, as migration related to climate change may bring already festering xenophobic attitudes to the fore, and generate conflict and violence [
