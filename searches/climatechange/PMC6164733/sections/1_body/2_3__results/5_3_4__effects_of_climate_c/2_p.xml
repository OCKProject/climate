According to a UNICEF report, children in South Africa are especially vulnerable to climate change, facing higher risks during extreme weather, malnutrition during food shortages, and respiratory disease from increases in pollen and dust [

Immunocompromised populations may also be more susceptible to the increased pathogen loads associated with higher temperatures, when factors such as stigma and poor health have already undermined their resilience. Migration, which is related in part to climate change, creates additional risks for HIV acquisition [
