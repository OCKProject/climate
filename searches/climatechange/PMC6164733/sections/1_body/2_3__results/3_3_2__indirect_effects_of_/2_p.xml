<p class="p">Importantly, climate change impacts on the persistence and dispersal of water- and food-borne pathogens in a myriad of ways. Droughts and high precipitation worsen water quality, and hamper hand washing and other hygiene practices [

 <xref rid="B65-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>]. Bacterial pathogens multiply faster in higher temperatures, which also can result in breakdowns in food cooling chains. A study in children under-five in Cape Town noted that a 5 °C rise in minimum weekly temperatures increased cases of diarrhoea by 40% one week thereafter [

An escalation in sea-surface temperature was linked to a cholera outbreak in 2000–2001 in KwaZulu-Natal, possibly stemming from an increased abundance of phytoplankton and thus higher numbers of copepods (small crustaceans commensal to cholera) that feed on these organisms [
