<p class="p">An analysis using national mortality and temperature data for each district of the country over 17 years found that temperature-related mortality (from cold or hot spells) accounts for 3.4% of deaths in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Those at extremes of age are most vulnerable, given their reduced thermoregulatory ability, as well as more limited mobility and resources to adjust to extreme temperatures. A study pooling data from Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg, calculated that for every 1 Â°C rise, overall mortality escalates by 1% and by 2% in those aged above 65 years [
