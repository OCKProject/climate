Low-cost government-built housing in South Africa and informal settlement houses (mostly made of sheets of corrugated iron, bricks, wood and plastic) are poorly insulated against heat and cold. During hot weather these structures may be 4–5 °C warmer than outdoor temperatures and cooler during cold spells by the same magnitude [

 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]. Similarly, many school classrooms in the country are constructed of prefabricated asbestos sheeting with corrugated iron roofing, are overcrowded and lack ceiling fans [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-01884" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Temperatures in these structures often exceed 30 °C and heat-health related symptoms are commonplace [

Equally concerning is the evidence that temperatures in many waiting rooms in public-sector health facilities are dangerously high. A study of eight rural clinics found that the temperature in these clinics was as much as 4 °C higher than outdoors, reaching temperature ranges associated with heat-health impact warning categories of ‘caution’ and ‘extreme caution’ [
