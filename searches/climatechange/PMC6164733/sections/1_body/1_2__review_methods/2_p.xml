<p class="p">To be included, articles had to describe the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible, including modelling studies, narrative and systematic reviews, case studies, case series and qualitative research. We excluded articles that were not in English (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 3), only covered animals or plants (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 343), were not on South Africa (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 270), were unrelated to health (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 47) or climate change (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 55), or were on climate change adaptation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 38) or mitigation (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 30). We then screened full text articles for eligibility (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 86), of which 34 were included. We then extracted data on the characteristics of the included articles (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-01884-t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). The findings presented in each included article were used to draft the text of the review. We also included additional articles located through searches of article references or through targeted internet searches for policy documents, for example.
