 <p class="p">We examined the photosynthetic responses of 
  <italic class="italic">Stipa baicalensis</italic> to relative long-term exposure (42 days) to the predicted elevated temperature and water availability changes to determine the mechanisms through which the plant would acclimate to future climate change. Two thermal regimes (ambient and +4 °C) and three irrigation levels (partial, normal and excess) were used in environmental control chambers. The gas exchange parameters, light response curves and

  <italic class="italic">Stipa baicalensis</italic> was unchanged. We concluded that nonstomatal limitation was the primary reason for photosynthesis regulation in 
  <italic class="italic">Stipa baicalensis</italic> under relative long-term climate change conditions. Although climate change caused reductions in the light use efficiency and photosynthetic rate, a self-photoprotection mechanism in 
  <italic class="italic">Stipa baicalensis</italic> resulted in its high ability to maintain normal live activities.
