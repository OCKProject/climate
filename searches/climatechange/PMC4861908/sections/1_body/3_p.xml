<p class="p">In many studies, high field temperatures and periods of drought often occur simultaneously, particularly in semiarid or drought-stricken areas

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Although the effects of elevated temperature and water availability on photosynthesis with each as a single factor have been extensively studied, relatively little is known about how plants respond to the interaction of these factors. Thus, the responses of photosynthesis (including stomatal and nonstomatal limitations) to the simultaneous elevation in temperature and decrease in water availability must be determined
