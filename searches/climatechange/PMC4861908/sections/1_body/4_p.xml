<p class="p">The grass 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa</italic> Linn. is the primary dominant and constructive species in the grasslands of northern China. Affected by the spatial heterogeneity of heat and precipitation, the 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa</italic> Linn. has a regular zonal distribution from the east to the west of China. The species 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa baicalensis</italic> (S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>) is one of the dominant and constructive 
 <italic class="italic">Stipa</italic> Linn. species in the meadow grasslands of China, which plays an important role in animal husbandry
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. The determination of the photosynthetic characteristics of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> in response to the changes in temperature and water availability can provide a theoretical basis for the reactions to climate change in the meadow steppe. The present study was performed using environmental control chambers to maintain the temperature and artificial irrigation to maintain the water availability for S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> at the required levels. Three hypotheses would be tested in the study: (1) The photosynthetic efficiency of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>is is reduced by nonstomatal limitation under the conditions of relative long-term moderate water treatments. (2) The photosynthetic capacity of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> under water deficit is further decreased by elevated temperature through reducing the activation of Rubisco and limiting the regeneration of RuBP. And (3) S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> is vulnerable to environmental stress and has difficulty in adapting to future climate change. The aims of this work were to investigate the relative effects of stomatal and nonstomatal limitations on photosynthesis to changes in the temperature and the availability of water and to determine the dominant factor in the regulation of photosynthesis in S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>. To achieve these goals, single-leaf gas exchange parameters, light response curves and 
 <italic class="italic">A</italic>/
 <italic class="italic">C</italic>
 <sub class="sub">i</sub> curves were determined to examine the responses of the physiological and biochemical mechanisms that affect the assimilation of carbon by S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> under conditions of elevated temperature and a change in water availability.
