<p class="p">One physiological process that is highly sensitive to high temperature stress is photosynthesis
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref> because the PSII in the light-dependent reactions and the Rubisco activase in the dark-dependent reactions are two thermally sensitive components of the photosynthetic apparatus
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>. Although many studies have been conducted to investigate the response of photosynthesis to high temperature stress, the physiological and biochemical mechanisms of the photoinhibition caused by the heat remain debatable
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" class="xref">19</xref>. The activation state of Rubisco is the key factor for the limitation on photosynthesis, and the Rubisco activase is highly susceptible to high temperatures
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. Moreover, high temperature stress can cause a large decrease in both the Rubisco activation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21" class="xref">21</xref> and the RuBP carboxylation rate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref> by inhibiting the Rubisco activase
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>. However, some other researchers also found that the inhibition of photosynthesis under heat stress might result from other limitations, including those on RuBP regeneration, electron transport, and photosystem II (PSII) and I (PSI)
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. Among the factors to limit photosynthesis, the PSII was the primary site of heat damage in the photosynthetic process
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> and was the most thermally labile component of the electron transport chain
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. When temperatures exceed 45 °C, damage to the PSII is dramatic
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. However, for most plants, moderate heat stress reduces the photosynthetic rate not by damaging the PSII
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref> but by increasing the PSI cyclic electron flow
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref> and the proton conductance of the thylakoid membranes in dark-adapted leaves
