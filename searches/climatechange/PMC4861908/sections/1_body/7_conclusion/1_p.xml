<p class="p">In conclusion, a decrease in the available soil water led to a water deficit in S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> after 42 days of irrigation. A temperature increase of 4 °C exacerbated the negative effects of the water deficit on S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>. Based on the measurements of the parameters of gas exchange, the nonstomatal limitation was the primary cause for the regulation of photosynthesis in S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>. The mechanism by which the increase in temperature and change in water availability affected photosynthesis in S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> was through the regulation of the photosynthetic capacity. With a decrease in water availability of 15%, the photosynthetic capacity decreased because of a reduction in the activation of Rubisco and the limitation of RuBP regeneration, which resulted in the nonstomatal limitation on S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>. An increase in water availability of 15% offset the negative effect of the drought and the photosynthetic capacity partially recovered. The mechanism by which a temperature higher by 4 °C affected the photosynthetic capacity of 
 <italic class="italic">S. baicalensis</italic> was primarily through a change in the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub>. Although the photosynthesis of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> was inhibited because of an elevated temperature and a water deficit, the S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> maintained a normal metabolism with dark respiration providing the energy for the plants. Under environmental stress, the S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> had an apparent self-photoprotection mechanism to maintain its normal live activities.
