<p class="p">The photosynthetic light response curves are a reflection of the ability of the plant to use light. The light response curves of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> in the different treatments of temperature and water availability are illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4A,B</xref>. Within the range of natural light intensity, the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">n</sub> of the leaves increased with the increase in the PAR. When the level of PAR reached the light saturation point (LSP), the curve became stable. When the PAR exceeded 1500 μmol·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>·s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the photosynthesis of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> suffered from light-inhibition, and the curve trended downwards. As shown in the curves, the response of the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">n</sub> to the light intensity was different under the different temperature and water treatments. Based on the simulated analysis of the light response curves (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>), the light-saturated photosynthesis (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) and the apparent quantum yield (AQY) in the leaves of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> were significantly affected by the temperature and the change in water availability (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01), and the AQY was significantly affected by the interaction of the two environmental factors (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). However, no significant effects on the light compensation point (LCP), the light saturated point (LSP) or the dark respiration (
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>) (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) were observed. In the T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and the AQY decreased by 26.4% and 18.8% in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment, respectively, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and the AQY increased by 37.3% and 21.9% in the W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatment, respectively. In the T
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> treatment, compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and the AQY decreased by 38.0% and 37.0% in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment, respectively, whereas the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> and the AQY increased by 44.6% and 33.3% in the W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatments, respectively. Moreover, in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub>, W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatments, compared with the T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> decreased by 29.6%, 16.4% and 11.9% and the AQY decreased by 10.8%, 15.6% and 7.7%, respectively, in the T
