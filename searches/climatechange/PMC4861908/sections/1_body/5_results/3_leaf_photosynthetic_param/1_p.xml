<p class="p">The values for the maximum rate of Rubisco (
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub>) and the maximum rate of ribulose-bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration (
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) in the different treatments of temperature and water availability are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>, the temperature and the change in water availability significantly affected the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub>, and a significant interaction between the two factors was detected (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In the T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment had a significant effect on the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub>, whereas in W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatment, the increase in the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> was approximately double. In the T
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> was significantly affected by the availability of water. Compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> decreased by 32.9% in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment, and in the W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatment, the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> increased by 45.0%. The 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was significantly affected by water availability (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>) but was not affected by high temperature. In theT
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, although the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> decreased in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment and increased in the W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatment, the difference between the treatments was not large. However, in the T
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> treatment, compared with the W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> treatment, the decrease in the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> was significant at 41.0% in the W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub> treatment, and although the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> increased in the W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub> treatment, the difference was not significant.
