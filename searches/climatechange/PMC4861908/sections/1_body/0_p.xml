<p class="p">In a comparison with the 50 years from 1850 to 1900, the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predicted that the global temperature will increase by approximately 1.5–4.0 °C because of the increase in the concentration of CO

Therefore, an understanding of the responses of plant photosynthesis to changes in temperature or water availability is necessary for people to address scientifically the problems of future climate change.
