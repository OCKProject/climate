<p class="p">The LSP and the LCP are the two primary indicators of the demand of a plant for sunlight and are indicators of the ability of the plants to use high and low light intensities. When the environment is not suitable, plants typically reduce the LSP or improve the LCP to ensure the normal operation of photosynthesis. The 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub> provides the energy for the activities of a plant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref> and is the index of the respiration rate of plants in the dark
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55" class="xref">55</xref>. Crous
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref> found that soil drought caused a decrease in the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>, and the author suggested that the possible reason was that the closing of the stomata under a water deficit changed the ratio of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and O
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the leaves and thereby affected the respiration of the plant
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>. However, the results from other studies also suggested that drought may inhibit the physiological activity of the plant, which reduces the requirement for energy and intermediate metabolites, resulting in the decrease of the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>. Furthermore, short-term temperature elevations can increase the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref> because a higher temperature could possibly increase the substrate concentration for the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>, which would lead to an increase in the activity of respiratory enzymes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. In our study, the relative long-term elevation in temperature and change in water availability had no significant effect on the 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic>
 <sub class="sub">d</sub>, the LCP or the LSP of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>, which indicated that the ability to use high and low light intensities for S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> under a changed environment had not yet responded, and the S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> remained capable of maintaining a normal metabolism with the dark respiration providing the energy for the plants.
