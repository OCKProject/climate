<p class="p">The nonstomatal limitation of photosynthesis was reflected in the changes in photosynthetic capacity. In C3-plants, according to the photosynthesis model of Farquhar 
 <italic class="italic">el al</italic>.
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>, the photosynthetic capacity is defined by two parameters: the maximum rate of carboxylation (
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub>) and the maximum rate of electron transport (
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>). In our study, based on the analysis of variance (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>), the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> and the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> were significantly affected by the change in water availability (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.01). A decrease in the water availability of 15% caused a decline in the photosynthetic capacity (
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> and 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub>) of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic>. These results were similar to the responses of plants to a water deficit that were found by other researchers
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. The decrease in the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> might result from the reduced amount of active Rubisco in soils under drought conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12" class="xref">12</xref>, and the reduction in the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> might be related to the limited regeneration of RuBP caused by an insufficient supply of NADPH or ATP or the limited enzymatic activity of sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase under water stress conditions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>. With an increase in water availability of 15%, the 
 <italic class="italic">V</italic>
 <sub class="sub">cmax</sub> and the 
 <italic class="italic">J</italic>
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> increased, and therefore, the increase in irrigation offset the negative effect of the drought, and the photosynthetic capacity of the S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> recovered, partially.
