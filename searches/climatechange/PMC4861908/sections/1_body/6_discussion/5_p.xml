<p class="p">The light response curve of plant photosynthesis, which is important to understand the photochemical efficiency, has been widely used in research on plant physiology
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>. The parameters of the light response curve reflect the response mechanisms of plant photosynthesis to environmental factors such as drought

 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> could be a mechanism for self-photoprotection that was triggered because of the contrasting requirements to dissipate heat and use energy for photochemical reactions
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52" class="xref">52</xref>. With light saturation, the environmental stress suppressed the photochemical reactions within the chloroplasts, which resulted in excitation energy that could not be used in photochemical reactions. To protect the photosynthetic apparatus from damage by the excess excitation energy, the plant dissipates the excess excitation energy as harmless heat through the xanthophyll cycle
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53" class="xref">53</xref>. With more heat dissipated, the light use was lower and the reduction in the photosynthetic rate was larger.
