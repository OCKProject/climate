<p class="p">The stress from the environment directly and/or indirectly influences a series of physiological and biochemical processes that affect photosynthesis in plants, which include a change in pigment complexes, destruction of chloroplast structures, limited enzyme activities and disturbance to electron transport

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>. Among the environmental stress factors, a water deficit affects plant photosynthesis through stomatal and nonstomatal limitations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. The stomatal limitation leads to a decrease in the net photosynthesis (

 <sub class="sub">n</sub>) because with a water deficit, the stoma is closed and the declined stomatal conductance results in a substomatal CO

 <sub class="sub">i</sub>) that is insufficient for photosynthesis. The nonstomatal limitations, including photosynthetic phosphorylation, regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), carboxylation efficiency (CE), light capture capability (PSII activity), activation of Rubisco and the synthesis of ATP, can also explain the photosynthetic down-regulation caused by a water deficit

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14" class="xref">14</xref>. Generally, stomatal limitation is the primary reason for the reduction in photosynthetic efficiency in mild to moderate drought stress

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. Additionally, the decline in the photosynthetic rate is primarily caused by stomatal limitation in the early stages of water stress, whereas the reduction in photosynthesis with long-term water stress may be caused by nonstomatal limitations
