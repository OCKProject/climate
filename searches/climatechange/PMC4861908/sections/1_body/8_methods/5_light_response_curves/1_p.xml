<p class="p">The leaves used to obtain the light response curves were the identical leaves that were used for the determination of the parameters of gas exchange (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information</xref>: Photosynthetic irradiance response curves). The open gas exchange system (LI-6400) was also used to control the light intensity inside the leaf chamber. After a period of acclimation, the light curves were determined using the ‘Auto Light Curve Program’ with nine light intensities: 1500, 900, 600, 400, 150, 100, 50, 20, and 0 μmol·m
