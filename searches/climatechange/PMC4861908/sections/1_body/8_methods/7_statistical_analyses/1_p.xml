<p class="p">The parameters described above were measured at the blooming stage (42 days after the plants were subjected to the temperature and soil water treatments of S. 
 <italic class="italic">breviflora</italic>. The statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS 18.0 statistical software package (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). For each treatment, the mean with standard deviation (±SD) was shown. The effects of temperature or water availability on the photosynthetic parameters were determined with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05), followed by Duncan’s multiple range tests (Duncan, 1955). The significance of the interaction effect of temperature and water availability on the photosynthetic parameters was analysed using a two-way ANOVA (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05). The graphs were constructed using the Origin 9.0 software (Origin Lab, USA).
