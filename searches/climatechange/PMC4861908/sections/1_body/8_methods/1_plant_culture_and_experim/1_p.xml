<p class="p">The experiment was conducted at the Institute of Botany, Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2012. The seeds of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> were obtained from the grassland in Hailaer (49°22′N, 119°73′E), Inner Mongolia. Before sowing, the seeds were sterilized by soaking in a 0.7% potassium permanganate solution for 8 min; the seeds were rinsed following the sterilization. The plastic pots (10.9 cm in diameter, 9.5 cm in height), each wrapped with plastic film, were filled with approximately 0.61 kg of dry soil (organic carbon content 12.3 g·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, total nitrogen content 1.45 g·kg
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and soil field capacity 25.8%), and ten seeds were planted per pot. The pots were placed in a naturally illuminated glasshouse (the daytime/nighttime temperature was maintained at approximately 26–28 °C/18–20 °C, with a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1000 μmol·m
 <sup class="sup">−2</sup>·s
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> above the plant canopy) and were well watered to complete the growth of the seedlings. With the emergence of the third leaf (approximately 2 to 3 weeks after sowing), the seedlings were thinned to four plants per pot. Six replicates were used for the three water and the two temperature treatments. Then, 36 pots with healthy plants (four plants per pot) were randomly selected and placed into two environmental control chambers in which the two temperature treatments were simulated (Ambient temperature, T
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>; Ambient temperature +4 °C, T
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and the three water irrigation treatments were applied (Control, W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>; W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> increased by 15%, W
 <sub class="sub">+15</sub>; W
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> decreased by 15%, W
 <sub class="sub">−15</sub>). To avoid the effects from other environmental factors, such as light and relative humidity, the arrangements of the pots with different treatments were randomized once a week.
