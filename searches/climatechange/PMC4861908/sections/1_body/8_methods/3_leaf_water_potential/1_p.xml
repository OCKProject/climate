<p class="p">The leaf water potential of S. 
 <italic class="italic">baicalensis</italic> was measured using a WP4 Dew-point Potential Meter (Decagon Device, Pullman, Washington). The leaf sample was obtained from a fully expanded leaf from the tip, with three plant replicates for each treatment. The measurements were conducted between 8:00 and 11:00 a.m. After cutting the sample, the leaf was immediately moved into the chamber and was equilibrated at least 10â€‰min before determination of the leaf water potential.
