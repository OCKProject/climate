  <p class="p">(a) Best‐fit phylogeographic scenario inferred using ABC. The distributional shift hypothesis represents a case where the Northern (N) cluster first diverged from the Southern (S) cluster, and the Central (C) cluster subsequently diverged from the Northern cluster, in a stepping‐stone fashion. Branch widths of the population tree represent effective population sizes (Ne), and the model includes brief bottlenecks associated with each founder event (see Section 2—Step 3). (b) Extended Bayesian skyline plot. The plot shows changes in effective population size (Ne) over time in the Central cluster, jointly estimated from mtDNA and nDNA data</p>
