<p class="p">Extraction of genomic DNA was performed using a DNeasy tissue kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's recommendations. Portions of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and II (COII) genes, and an intronic portion of the nuclear endo‐beta‐1,4‐glucanase (EB14G) gene, were amplified via polymerase chain reaction using primers (Supporting Information Table
