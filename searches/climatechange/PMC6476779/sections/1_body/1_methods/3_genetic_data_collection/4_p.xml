<p class="p">We concatenated COI and COII and refer to this sequence (COI + COII) as the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) locus; we refer to EB14G as the nuclear DNA (nDNA) locus. For the latter, heterozygous sites were scored using the “Find Heterozygotes” plugin in Geneious. For a site to be considered heterozygous, we required that height of the secondary peak was at least 50% of the primary peak (sites with quality scores &lt; 20, were coded as “N”). Allele haplotypes were inferred using PHASE v.2.1.1 (Stephens, Smith, &amp; Donnelly, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0091" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), with the following settings: 90% phase certainty, 10,000 iterations, thinning interval = 10, burn‐in = 1,000, and the default recombination model. PHASE was run three times to evaluate consistency of results.
