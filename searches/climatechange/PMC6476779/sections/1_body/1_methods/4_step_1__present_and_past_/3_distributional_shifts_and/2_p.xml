<p class="p">We used a threshold value to convert continuous occurrence probabilities to a binary classification of suitable (&gt;0.2) versus unsuitable (≤0.2). The occurrence probability threshold was chosen based on the True Skill Statistic (TSS; Allouche, Tsoar, &amp; Kadmon, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Specifically, we chose a threshold value that maximized the TSS, as this approach has consistently performed better than other thresholding methods (Liu, Berry, Dawson, &amp; Pearson,

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0064" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, since we used multiple pseudo‐absence replicates, we had the opportunity to maximize TSS without risking under‐prediction of presences, which results from choosing a high threshold value. Indeed, using distributions of TSS and threshold values, we were able to select the lowest threshold (0.2; Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3.1</xref>), below which TSS had a steep slope. To calculate the distributional shift between two successive time periods (e.g., LIG to LGM, or LGM to MH), we took the difference of the two binary maps, after multiplying the more recent time period by two in order to ensure that we obtain four categories in the distributional shift calculation: colonization (difference = 2), stability (1), absence (0), and extinction (−1; see Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3.2</xref>). Similarly, to estimate areas of stability (i.e., persistence in a location between successive time periods), we multiplied the binary occurrence maps (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3.2</xref>) of the corresponding periods: locations where the product is 1 were considered to harbor stable habitats across time periods (stability = 1).
