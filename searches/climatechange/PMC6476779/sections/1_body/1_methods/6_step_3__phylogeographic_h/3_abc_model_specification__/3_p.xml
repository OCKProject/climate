<p class="p">To characterize the empirical two‐locus DNA sequence dataset, we used the following summary statistics: number of segregating sites (one‐ and two‐sample) and private segregating sites (one‐sample), mean (one‐ and two‐sample) and variance of pairwise differences (one‐sample), mean and variance of numbers of the rarest nucleotide at segregating sites (one‐sample), Tajima's (

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), model checking was performed via principal components analysis, and then posterior probabilities were calculated via logistic regression (Fagundes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) on 1% of simulated data most similar to the empirical data, to identify the best‐fit model (Cornuet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). We evaluated model performance (i.e., the ability to discriminate between the best‐supported and alternative scenarios), by estimating type I and type II error rates. To do this, we simulated 500 data sets and estimated the most likely model using a polychotomous logistic regression (Cornuet, Ravigne, &amp; Estoup, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>; Cornuet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). The type I error rate was the proportion of data sets that were simulated under an alternative scenario but were incorrectly categorized under the best‐supported scenario. The type II error rate was the proportion of instances in which the best‐supported scenario was incorrectly selected as the most likely scenario. To calculate point estimates and confidence intervals for the values of parameters included in the best‐fit model, we selected 1% of the simulated data closest to the observed data. Additionally, for the best‐fit scenario, we estimated precision in parameter estimation (Cornuet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>) by computing the relative median of the absolute error for 500 simulated data sets with values drawn from posterior distributions.
