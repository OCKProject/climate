<p class="p">We used ABC, as implemented in the software DIYABC v.2.1.0 (Cornuet et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), to assess alternative hypotheses designed to determine whether expansion out of long‐term stable refugia, distributional shifts, or vicariance was the major underlying process generating the present‐day spatial distribution of genetic variation. mtDNA plus (phased) nDNA sequence data were used, and we conditioned these analyses on a posteriori knowledge of the existence of three distinct genetic clusters of

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we employed a two‐tiered approach, where best‐fit scenarios from separate analyses in the first tier are subsequently compared against each other in the second tier. This hierarchical or tournament‐style approach has also been applied in other study systems (Espindola et al.,
