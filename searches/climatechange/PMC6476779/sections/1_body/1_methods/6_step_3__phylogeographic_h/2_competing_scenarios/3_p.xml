<p class="p">All scenarios in both tiers incorporated bottleneck events, because they all involved divergence of new populations from an existing population, and thus founder effects. Indeed, our inclusion of bottleneck events enabled specification of progenitor‐descendant relationships between pairs of diverging populations (as in Garrick et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Furthermore, the nonnegligible role of bottlenecks during climatically driven population divergence has been established. In one set of analyses in the first tier of ABC comparisons, we assessed scenarios in which

 <italic class="italic">,</italic> such that the other areas were colonized via successive expansions out of that refugium. We considered three different refugial locations (i.e., the north, south, or central portion of the study region; see Section 3—Step 2). In a second set of analyses within the first tier, we assessed scenarios that involved distributional shifts (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4.4</xref>), whereby populations diverged in a stepping‐stone fashion (i.e., one population gave rise to a descendant population, which later became the progenitor of the third population). Here, we considered all possible stepping‐stone configurations (i.e., there was no assumption that only nearest neighbors can exhibit a progenitor‐descendant relationship). In the second tier of ABC comparisons, the best‐fit hypotheses from the refugial and distributional shift scenarios were directly compared, along with an additional hypothesis that incorporated vicariance (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4.5</xref>). The reason for including this third hypothesis was to test the possibility that the original ancestral population no longer exists, having split into two new populations, one of them giving rise to a third population. While there are other vicariance hypotheses that could have been compared in the first tier, we chose not to do this based on the sequence of divergence events best‐fit refugial and distributional shift hypotheses had in common. This reduced the number of plausible vicariance hypotheses to one.
