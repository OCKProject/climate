<p class="p">We also examined evidence for changes in Ne over time in each cluster by analyzing the combined mtDNA plus (unphased) nDNA sequence data using Extended Bayesian Skyline Plots (EBSP; Heled &amp; Drummond, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) in BEAST. The same mutation rate parameters for phylogenetic tree estimation were used here, and EBSP searches were run for 50 million Markov chain Monte Carlo generations, with a burn‚Äêin of 5 million generations. Samples were saved every 2,500 generations and ESS and the stationarity of likelihood values were examined in order to make sure all ESS values were greater than 500.
