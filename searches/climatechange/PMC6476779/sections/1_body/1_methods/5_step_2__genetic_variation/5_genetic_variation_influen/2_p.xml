<p class="p">To estimate the amount of genetic variation explained by spatial structure versus the environment, we used distance‐based redundancy analysis (dbRDA; Legendre &amp; Anderson, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). We computed the genetic distance matrix using the “dist.dna” function of the “ape” (Paradis &amp; Schliep, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0077" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>) package, and performed dbRDA using the “capscale” function of the “vegan” (Oksanen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0076" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>) package in R. To compute the response variable, genetic distances (i.e., matrix of pairwise mutational differences between DNA sequences) were estimated using the TN93 (Tamura &amp; Nei, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0097" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>) model of sequence evolution, allowing for different rates for transitions and transversions. For environmental predictors, we used the contemporary environmental factors obtained via factor analysis (see Section 2—Step 1). To obtain spatial structure predictors, we transformed Euclidean geographic distances to a continuous rectangular vector by Principal Coordinates analysis of Neighbor Matrices (PCNM) using the “pcnm” function in “vegan.” Significance of the predictors was assessed using multivariate 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>‐statistics with 9,999 permutations. We first analyzed the relationship between the genetic distance matrix and each environmental factor separately, and then performed a partial dbRDA for each variable while controlling for the influence of spatial structure, using only significant PCNM eigenvectors. Similarly, we analyzed the relationship between genetic distances and PCNM eigenvectors, retained the significant eigenvectors, and then removed interactions with the environment to obtain the contribution of spatial structure alone.
