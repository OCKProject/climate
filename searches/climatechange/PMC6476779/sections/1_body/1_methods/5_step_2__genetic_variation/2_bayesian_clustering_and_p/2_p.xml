<p class="p">To determine the number of geographically cohesive genetic groups of 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic>, we analyzed geo‐referenced mtDNA sequences in BAPS v.6.0 (Cheng, Connor, Siren, Aanensen, &amp; Corander, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We assessed values of 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic> (i.e., the number of clusters) ranging from 2–20, with 10 replicate runs each. We also examined evidence for geographically cohesive genetic groups by representing the variance in mtDNA sequences using Principal Components Analysis (PCA), performed with the “prcomp” function in R.
