<p class="p">To address the aims of this study, we used the following workflow: 
 <list list-type="simple" id="ece35065-list-0001" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Step 1—Model present‐day and historical climate‐based distributions of 
    <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> in order to identify potential refugia and generate expectations about directionality of range contractions or expansions, including distributional shifts;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Step 2—Infer the number of distinct populations using spatial‐genetic clustering, and cross‐validate via principal component analysis, and phylogenetic reconstruction; characterize genetic variation within and differentiation among populations, and; estimate the amount of genetic variation explained by dispersal (spatial structure) and environment (contemporary climatic conditions);</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Step 3—Test alternative phylogeographic hypotheses to determine whether expansion out of refugia, distributional shifts, or vicariance was the underlying historical process generating the observed patterns of genetic variation within and among populations; estimate values of parameters included in the best‐fit phylogeographic hypothesis; and assess evidence for changes in effective population size over time.</p>
