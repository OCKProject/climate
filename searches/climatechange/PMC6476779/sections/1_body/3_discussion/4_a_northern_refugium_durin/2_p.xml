<p class="p">Our analyses suggested that a northern refuge played a key role in subsequent colonization by 
 <italic class="italic">R.Â flavipes</italic> of the central region of the southern Appalachians. Pollen records indicate that climatic conditions suitable for temperate forests existed over large areas of the southeastern U.S. during the LGM (Williams, Post, Cwynar, Lotter, &amp; Levesque, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0108" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Furthermore, fossil and genetic evidence suggest that some tree species, including red oak, red maple and beech, were widespread in this region during that time (Magni, Ducousso, Caron, Petit, &amp; Kremer,

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0070" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Although somewhat unexpected, the existence of northern refugia close to the southern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet during the LGM is plausible owing to localized warm areas in close proximity to glaciers (Bennett &amp; Provan,
