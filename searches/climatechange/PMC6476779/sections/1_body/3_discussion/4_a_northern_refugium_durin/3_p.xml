<p class="p">Despite the broad geographic range of the 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> Central cluster (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a), this group contained the lowest genetic diversity (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35065-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We suggest that this is likely the result of founder effects associated with the relatively recent colonization of the central portion of the southern Appalachians from the north. Although subsequent population expansion seems to have occurred in the central region, more time may be needed to replace lost genetic variation. Assessment of changes in Ne over time showed that the Central cluster had increased in size over the last 10,000 years (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>b), which is consistent with inferences based on nongenetic data that indicated the amount of suitable habitat in the central region increased since the LGM (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
