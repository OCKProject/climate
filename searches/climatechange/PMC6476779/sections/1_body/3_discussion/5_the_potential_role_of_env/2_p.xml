<p class="p">Given the desiccation susceptibility of soft‐bodied arthropods, range expansions and population growth in 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> may be have been influenced by local‐scale site‐specific environmental variables such as precipitation. The southeastern U.S. was much warmer during the mid‐Holocene (cf. LGM; Bartlein et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>), when tupelo and oak forest types dominated over pine, indicating wetter conditions (LaMoreaux, Brook, &amp; Knox, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). The 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> Central cluster likely diverged from the Northern cluster following a cooling trend in the Younger Dryas (~12.9–11.7 kya). While this was a global cooling period, locally in the southeastern U.S., this period was characterized by a warmer and wetter climate, reflecting the trapping of heat in the western subtropical gyre due to reduced Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (Grimm et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). Accordingly, if high precipitation was important for facilitating range expansion, these conditions seem to have been in place at a time that coincides with colonization of the central region. Furthermore, seasonal differences in precipitation between the southern and northern portions of the study region (Hyseni &amp; Garrick, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>) may have led to different flight phenologies and thus seasonal isolation and niche partitioning. Consistent with this, dbRDA revealed that in addition to spatial structuring of genetic variation, wet‐season precipitation accounted for the remainder of genetic differentiation of the Southern cluster compared to the other two. We suggest that the influence of local‐scale environmental variables upon the capacity for termite population growth and range expansion warrants further investigation.
