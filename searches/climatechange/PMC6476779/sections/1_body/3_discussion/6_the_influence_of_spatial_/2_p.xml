<p class="p">Compared to previous work on 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic>, the spatial scale over which we detected genetic structure is notable. For example, based on mtDNA sequence and microsatellite genotypic data, Perdereau et al. (
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) identified three distinct genetic clusters of 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> in the eastern and southeastern U.S. across an area spanning at least twice the distance covered by sampling in the present study. However, with the exception of a few collection sites in West Virginia, those authors did not include 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> sampled from the southern Appalachians. This contrast supports the view that fine‐scale genetic structuring may be particularly prevalent in topographically complex montane areas (Garrick,

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>; Thomas &amp; Hedin, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0098" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Along a ~1,000 km transect traversing the southern Appalachians, a wood‐feeding cockroach (
 <italic class="italic">Cryptocercus punctulatus</italic>) that is syntopic with 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> consists of five distinct genetic groups (Everaerts et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Garrick, Sabree, Jahnes, &amp; Oliver, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Interestingly, both of these saproxylic taxa have a zone of parapatry between genetic groups in the central region. Comparative phylogeographic analyses would be informative about the extent to which spatial‐genetic patterns seen in dead‐wood‐associated insects correspond with shared microevolutionary processes that underpin them.
