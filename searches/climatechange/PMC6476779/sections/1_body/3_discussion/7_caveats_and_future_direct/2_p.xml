<p class="p">An early understanding of genetic consequences of Pleistocene range expansions came from study systems that either repeatedly experienced severe glaciation (Hewitt, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>), or were relatively simplified linear systems (Nason, Hamrick, &amp; Fleming, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0074" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). In these cases, unidirectional expansion out of a single major refuge was commonly inferred, often based on signatures of repeated founder effects and serial reduction in genetic diversity at the leading edge. However, an expanded view of the geography of range expansion may be needed when considering unglaciated, topographically complex, montane landscape settings. In this study, we considered distributional shift (see Section 1) to be a plausible phylogeographic scenario for the southern Appalachian Mountains. However, further work is needed to understand the circumstances under which distributional shift scenarios are distinguishable from single‐refuge contraction‐expansion scenarios. Indeed, inferring Pleistocene distributional shifts using genetic data can be challenging, as multiple historical factors can contribute to current genetic variation.
