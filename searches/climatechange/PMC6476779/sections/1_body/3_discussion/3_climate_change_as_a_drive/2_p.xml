<p class="p">Determining whether distributional shifts have occurred in the history of a species can lead to a better understanding of processes that have shaped present‐day genetic variation. Our SDMs suggested that in the period between the LIG and LGM, suitable habitat for

 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). Consistent with this, our genetic analyses confirmed that the Northern cluster diverged between the LIG and LGM (ABC: 26.4–115.0 kya; BEAST: 83.6–195.0 kya). As suitable habitat expanded southward following the LGM (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>), the Central cluster diverged during the LGM‐Holocene transition (ABC: 2.8–22.5 kya; BEAST: 21.5–56.7 kya) and continued to expand in the Holocene, both in terms of geographic range (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and population size (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
