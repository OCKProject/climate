<p class="p">Our inferences about the long‐term population history of 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> are not dissimilar from reconstructions of glacial‐interglacial colonization routes followed by many plant and animal species in the eastern U.S. For example, the pitcher‐plant mosquito, 
 <italic class="italic">Wyeomyia smithii</italic>, initially dispersed from the Gulf Coast northward along the East Coast, and subsequently moved southward into the southern Appalachians (Merz et al.,

 <italic class="italic">Pseudotriton ruber</italic>, persisted in the Coastal Plain in the early Pliocene, and then expanded its range toward Appalachian upland habitat as cooling trends started in the early Pleistocene (Folt, Garrison, Guyer, Rodriguez, &amp; Bond, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Thus, despite different life history traits, at least a few forest‐dependent organisms may have responded similarly to climatic fluctuations in the past.
