<p class="p">In contrast to landscapes that were repeatedly covered by ice sheet advances throughout the Pleistocene, those in temperate or tropical regions that remained unglaciated potentially contained numerous refugia (Byrne, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Indeed, in montane areas with deeply dissected topography, latitude alone may be a poor proxy for the locations of refugial areas, as the steep environmental gradients that occur locally can exert a strong influence on persistence of habitat patches that can support viable populations. In such regions—in contrast to the traditional view of refuges being continuously occupied long‐term stable areas—successive glacial‐interglacial cycles are less likely to have repeatedly played out in the same way. Owing to stochastic processes, they may have instead been somewhat ephemeral. For instance, a refugium may have been only periodically occupied, with the process of shifting between alternative refugia from one glacial cycle to the next involving extinction at the trailing edge and colonization at the leading edge. Herein, we refer to this particular case of contraction–expansion dynamics as “distributional shift” and consider it a plausible model for the focal landscape setting. Indeed, consideration of how major shifts in geographic distributions contributed to population differentiation during the Pleistocene is important for understanding speciation processes (Carstens &amp; Knowles,
