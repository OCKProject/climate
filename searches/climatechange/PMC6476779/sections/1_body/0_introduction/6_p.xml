<p class="p">Reconstructing long‐term population history is often achieved via analyses of geo‐referenced DNA sequence data, using spatially explicit phylogenetic and/or coalescent‐based analytical approaches (see Knowles, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>; Hickerson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref> and references therein). Increasingly, complementary nongenetic data are being employed to augment inferences or to generate hypotheses about past events and population processes. In particular, Species Distribution Models (SDM) are now widely used to locate glacial refugia (Richards, Carstens, &amp; Knowles, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0085" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), or determine the influence of past climate change on current genetic structure (Alexandrino, Teixeira, Arntzen, &amp; Ferrand, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0001" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). In some cases, similar conclusions about phylogeographic history have been drawn from SDMs and genetic data (Waltari et al., 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0105" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Briefly, SDMs relate occurrence records for a given species with the environmental conditions in those same locations in order to estimate geographic areas in which the species is likely to be found (Guisan &amp; Thuiller, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). Given that historical climatic fluctuations can trigger range contractions and expansions—including wholesale distributional shifts (Pielou, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0081" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1991</xref>)—SDMs can form a framework for understanding the genetic consequences of glacial‐interglacial climate change (Knowles &amp; Alvarado‐Serrano, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0056" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>).
