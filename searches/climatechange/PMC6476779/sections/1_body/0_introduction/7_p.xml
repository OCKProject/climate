<p class="p">In this study, we investigated the genetic consequences of glacial‐interglacial climate change on 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> from the unglaciated southern Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas, and considered distributional shifts as a plausible hypothesis (among others) to be assessed using SDMs and genetic data. Given the reliance of this species on dead‐wood microhabitats, our expectation was that during the Pleistocene and earlier, 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic> closely tracked the changing distributions of forest habitats, and was strongly impacted by climatic fluctuations. Indeed, ecologically specialized low‐mobility forest insects may be particularly well‐suited for reconstructing past climatic impacts on montane forest landscapes, in part owing to their short generation times and ability to persist in habitat patches too small to support more mobile vertebrates (Garrick et al.,

 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic>, we expected that relatively fine‐scale genetic structuring would be detectable. To test these expectations, we modeled present and past distributions and used contrasts between these SDMs to make inferences about distributional shifts and to identify areas of stability (i.e., potential refugia). Based on this, we generated competing hypotheses about drivers of genetic divergence, and then tested these via analyses of DNA sequence data using coalescent simulations. In addition to the effects of historical climatic conditions, we also considered the influence, if any, of contemporary climatic conditions and dispersal‐based spatial structure on genetic variation in
