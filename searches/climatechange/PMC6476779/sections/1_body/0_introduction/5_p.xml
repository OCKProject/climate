<p class="p">The eastern subterranean termite, 
 <italic class="italic">Reticulitermes flavipes</italic>, currently inhabits previously glaciated regions of the northeastern U.S., as well as the unglaciated southern Appalachian Mountains and surrounding areas. This species is a key ecosystem engineer that makes major contributions to dead‐wood decomposition and nutrient cycling in forests (Myer &amp; Forschler, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0072" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2019</xref>; Ulyshen, Wagner, &amp; Mulrooney, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0101" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and its distribution is influenced by humidity and temperature (Wiltz, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0109" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). This diploid eusocial species live in colonies that typically have a simple family structure, arising from an outbred primary reproductive pair that remains fertile for 6–11 years (Vargo &amp; Husseneder, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). When the king or queen dies, some full‐sib workers differentiate into male and female secondary reproductives, at which point the colony becomes inbred (Vargo &amp; Carlson, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0102" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). However, in addition to temporal transitions from simple to extended families, there may also be spatial partitioning, whereby the initial reproductive center, with the primary reproductives, expands into satellite nests housing secondary reproductives (Thorne, Traniello, Adams, &amp; Bulmer, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0099" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1999</xref>). Winged alates disperse away from the original colony and establish new colonies and then shed their wings. However, dispersal abilities are only moderate, with distances varying from a few meters to &gt;1 km (Vargo &amp; Husseneder, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0103" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Such limited dispersal is conducive to strong historical inference (Cruzan &amp; Templeton, 
 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>).
