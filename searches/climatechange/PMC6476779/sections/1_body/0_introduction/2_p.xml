<p class="p">Geographic barriers to dispersal, such as mountains and rivers, are considered major drivers of genetic divergence within and among species. The influence of climate change (e.g., glacial‐interglacial oscillations during the Pleistocene) in generating phylogeographic structure is also widely recognized (Hewitt,

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref> and references therein). For example, in Europe, when ice sheets reached their maximum extent during glacials, this repeatedly resulted in range contraction into southern refugia, which subsequently served as key reservoirs for recolonization via northward expansion during interglacials (Hewitt,

 <xref rid="ece35065-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). In these regions at high latitudes, successive glacial‐interglacial cycles were likely to reinforce the same genetic signatures of contraction and expansion (but see Gomez &amp; Lunt,
