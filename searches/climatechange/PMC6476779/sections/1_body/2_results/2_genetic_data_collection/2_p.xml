<p class="p">mtDNA sequences were obtained from 122 
 <italic class="italic">R.Â flavipes</italic> individuals, and the nDNA locus was sequenced from 124 individuals. The mtDNA alignment had 86 polymorphic sites and 32 haplotypes, while the nDNA locus had five polymorphic sites and five haplotypes (Table 
 <xref rid="ece35065-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). All sampled logs contained individuals with the same mtDNA haplotype, with the exception of a rotting log sampled at site A41 (see Supporting Information Table 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S1.1</xref>), which contained two different haplotypes from the same genetic population, suggesting a rare instance of colony fusion (see DeHeer &amp; Vargo,
