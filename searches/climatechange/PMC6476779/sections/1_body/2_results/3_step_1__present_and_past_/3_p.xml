<p class="p">Distributional shift and stability maps (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) showed that: (a) from the LIG to the LGM, most of the suitable habitat shifted northward from the East Coast and the Gulf Coast toward the location of the southern edge of the Laurentide ice sheet, above 40° latitude; (b) from the LIG to the present, the southern edge of 
 <italic class="italic">R. flavipes</italic>' distribution underwent a extinction‐colonization (or contraction‐expansion) cycle; (c) the eastern portion of West Virginia and areas around western North Carolina had suitable habitat from the LIG to the present; and (d) the amount of suitable habitat increased since the beginning of the Holocene.
