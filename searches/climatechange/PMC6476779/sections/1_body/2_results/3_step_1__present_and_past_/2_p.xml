<p class="p">When constructing SDMs, a strong correlation was observed among some of the 19 bioclimatic variables (Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S5.6</xref>). Three iterations of eliminating variables and factors with low contributions to the total variation were required until all retention criteria were met. Ultimately, four factors (MR1–4,

 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3.4</xref>) explained 100% of the variation in eight retained variables, and 84% of the variation in all 19 bioclimatic variables. Correlation among the four factors was lower than among the original variables in all four time periods considered (i.e., present, MH, LGM, and LIG; Supporting Information Table
