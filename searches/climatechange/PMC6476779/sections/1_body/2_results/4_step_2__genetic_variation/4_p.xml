<p class="p">Genetic structure was influenced by environment and geography. The full model of environmental and spatial structure predictors accounted for 58.7% of the observed genetic variation at the mtDNA locus. Spatial structure alone explained 41.1% (

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.012) of the variation. The interaction between the two explained an additional 12.4% of the genetic variation. After removing the effect of spatial structure, the factors with significant contribution to genetic variation were “temperature range” and “wet‐season precipitation” (Supporting Information Figure
