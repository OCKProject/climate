<p class="p">The BAPS analysis identified three genetic clusters, each with largely separate geographic distributions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). Herein, we refer to them as the Northern, Central, and Southern clusters. We used the first three principal components (PCs) to represent these clusters in three dimensions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). The three PCs accounted for 53% of the variance at the mtDNA locus; they showed that the Northern cluster is most similar to the Central cluster. Phylogenetic reconstruction using BEAST produced a Bayesian tree (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>c) that corroborated the three clusters identified using BAPS and PCA, albeit with the Northern cluster as paraphyletic. Molecular dating using the mtDNA locus in BEAST estimated the Southern‐Northern divergence at a median of 131.9 kya (95% CI: 83.6–195.0 kya; Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6.10</xref>), and the Northern‐Central divergence at a median of 35.8 kya (95% CI: 21.5–56.7 kya; Supporting Information Figure 
 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S6.10</xref>).
