<p class="p">In the two sets of first‐tier ABC comparisons: (a) the refuge‐based scenario with the highest posterior probability was the hypothesis that postulated the Northern region was the source from which the Southern cluster diverged first, followed by the Central cluster (scenario R3; Table

 <xref rid="ece35065-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S4.5</xref>). The DS1 scenario had a posterior probability of 0.932 when compared against other DS scenarios in the first tier, but its posterior probability in the second tier was 0.495 compared to 0.332 for the second‐best R3 scenario. Both of these scenarios had high type I and II error rates in the second‐tier comparisons (Supporting Information Table

Based on examination of estimated parameter values from the best‐fit model, divergence between the Northern and Southern populations was the oldest, estimated to have occurred 64.80 kya (95% CI: 26.40–115.00 kya; Figure
