<p class="p">The study was guided by descriptive and exploratory research designs. Kothari (
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>) posits that descriptive research seeks to gather fertile data and in-depth understanding of the phenomenon under study. In this case the study sought to understand the challenges faced by people in the Mazungunye communal lands in their efforts to mitigate the impact of climate change. This research design was chosen as it is renowned for producing quality data and it is in-depth in nature (Creswell 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). The researcher made use of the exploratory research design as well. Creswell (
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) indicates that the main aim of exploratory research is to identify the boundaries of the environment in which the problems, opportunities or situations of interest are likely to reside and to identify the salient factors or variables that might be found there and be of relevance to the research. He adds that this is the most useful research design for those projects that are addressing a subject about which there are high levels of uncertainty and ignorance and when the problem is not very well understood. The exploratory design was suitable for this study, which was conducted in a marginalised rural community.
