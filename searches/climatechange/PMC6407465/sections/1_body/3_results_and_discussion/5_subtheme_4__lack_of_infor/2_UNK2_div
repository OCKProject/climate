 <p class="p" xmlns="">‘We appreciate the role that NGOs such as Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere (CARE), GOAL and Action Faim are playing in meeting our needs in times of drought resulting from climate change like this. The organisations are supporting us in the best way they can, but we haven’t learned much about the causes of this drought, and it is their role to educate us even on how best to remain strong.’ (Non-Governmental Organisation official, Male, 45 years of age)</p>
