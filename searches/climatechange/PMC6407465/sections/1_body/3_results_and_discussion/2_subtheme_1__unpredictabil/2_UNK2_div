 <p class="p" xmlns="">‘We used to rely more on indigenous knowledge for productive farming in our community. Heavy rains were mostly characterised by budding of new leaves on a dry trees, rumbling sounds from hills or flames on mountains; the belief was heavy rains would put out the fire. Low rainfall is predicted by the presence of birds’ nests, which they build on lower levels of the trees.’ (Village leader, Male, 76 years of age)</p>
