Harvest failures are perpetual in most parts of Bikita. In their study in Zimbabwe, Matarira et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) established that yields of maize, the most widely grown crop in Zimbabwe, decreased dramatically under dry land conditions in some regions (sometimes up to 30%) even under full irrigation conditions because of high temperature increases that shorten the farming season. Chazovachii et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) argues that commercialisation of the maize crop in Zimbabwe has also forced farmers in marginal lands to grow maize even though their agro-ecological conditions are unsuitable for maize faming, which has resulted in severe shortages of food. Hence, there is a growing feeling that crop yield and staple food grain production in marginal areas have become highly variable because of this shift.
