<p class="p">In Zimbabwe, as elsewhere in Africa, most rural households depend on natural resources for subsistence and livelihoods (Dube &amp; Phiri

 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>). Most rural communities in Zimbabwe are underdeveloped infrastructurally and the dependence on climatic volatile resources is very high. Their livelihood activities are reliant on the natural environment, savaged by climate change, which plunges these communities into climate change vulnerability (Dube &amp; Phiri 
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Gukurume (
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) observed that climate change has aggravated poverty levels in most rural communities of Zimbabwe, where 70% of the country’s population is trapped in high poverty circles and mostly located in rural areas. According to Chagutah (
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2010</xref>), Zimbabwe is particularly vulnerable because of its heavy dependence on rain-fed agriculture and climate-sensitive resources. Climate change variability has intensified problems as evidenced by declining agricultural outputs, decline in economic productivity, poverty and food insecurity, with rural people mainly affected. Mugabe and Chimutambgi (
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016</xref>) indicated that the government of Zimbabwe declared drought a national disaster on 05 February 2016 because of the dire effects of the El Niño weather. The declaration was meant to ensure a well-coordinated response to minimise distress and suffering caused by the climate change variability mostly in Masvingo and Matabeleland provinces, which are seriously engulfed in the catastrophic effects of climate change. These provinces are naturally situated in a region that receives low rainfall.
