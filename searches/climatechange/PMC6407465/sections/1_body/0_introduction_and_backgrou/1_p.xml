<p class="p">Climate change–related disasters have escalated around the world, causing a serious threat to the existence of humans and their livelihoods (Mugambiwa &amp; Tirivangasi

 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2018</xref>). Climate change, which is attributable to the natural climate cycle and human activities, has adversely affected agricultural productivity in Africa (Mugambiwa &amp; Tirivangasi

 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). There is ample evidence that reveals that Africa and other developing countries face more challenges from climate change because of poor adaptation mechanisms in place (Enete &amp; Achike

 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>). Zimbabwe’s rural community, too, has been negatively affected by the impacts of climate change. This can be evidenced by the increase in unreliable rainfall patterns, resulting in nationwide flash floods and droughts. This has left communities that rely on farming outputs at greater risk, because climate change diminishes the prospects of having a great yield every year.
