 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2015</xref>), in Masvingo Province’s two districts of Bikita and Zaka, dry spells are on the increase; rainfall patterns have become more erratic, therefore failing to support crop production. Masvingo Province has a strong likelihood of becoming a non-maize-producing area because of climate change (Matarira, Makadho &amp; Mukahanana-Sangarwe 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>). This calls for the need to improve communities’ food security by encouraging farmers to grow small-grain crops such as sorghum and millet, which are more tolerant to drought conditions than maize. However, the government has not done much to fund the growing of small-grain crops, which have been proved to be a viable means to mitigate the effects of climate change (Chazovachii, Chingwenya &amp; Mushuku 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). This can be cited as poor strategic planning on the part of the government, which keeps distributing maize seed in areas that are prone to drought instead of encouraging people in these areas to grow small-grain crops (Manyeruke, Hamauswa &amp; Mhandara
