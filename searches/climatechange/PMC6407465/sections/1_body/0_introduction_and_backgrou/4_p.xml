 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) indicated that in 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref> the government of Zimbabwe declared potato as a strategic food security crop. However, much has been done to assist farmers with funds to intensify production of this crop. Many farmers have not taken up potato farming because it is a capital-intensive crop that requires huge initial capital investment. The government has also not done much to provide extension services to farmers who want to venture into potato farming. Zimbabwe still experiences and is compromised by the presence of various socio-economic stresses which may interact with climate change impacts to increase community vulnerability and reduce adaptive capacity (Conway 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). The socio-economic stresses contribute to and compound the impacts of current climate change in Africa and will have negative effects on the countryâ€™s ability to cope with climate change (Conway 
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>). Such stresses include rampant poverty; various political, ethnic and economic conflicts; ignorance; lack of skills; low level of technological advancement; weak institutional capacity; limited infrastructure; lack of technology; lack of information and poor access to resources by the majority (Lisk
