  <p class="p">Cumulative area burned for a latitudinal gradient of transects in the Sierra Nevada under projected climate. The dynamic simulations include decadal re-estimated area burned distributions that account for prior fire events and projected climate. The static simulations include area burned distributions estimated only on projected climate. The lines are means and the shading 95
