 </sup>. The models were forced with the A2 emission scenario. We used projections from CNRM CMS (Centre National de Recherches Météorologiques Coupled Global Climate Model), CCSM3 (National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model), and GFDL CM2.1 (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Lab coupled model). These climate models performed well in capturing both climate variability and seasonality over the historical period in California
