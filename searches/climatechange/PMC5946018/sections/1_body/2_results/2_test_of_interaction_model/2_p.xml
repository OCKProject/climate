<p class="p">In the second set of analyses, spatial distance was entered as independent variable and description abstractness as moderator. When abstract consequences were described, the reference to Canada decreased self-change, 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = -0.94, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.36, BCCI [-1.8, -0.05] and tended to decrease repair, 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = -0.52, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.16, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.24, BCCI [-1.25, 0.21]. When concrete consequences were described the reference to spatial distance had no effect, influencing neither self-change: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.14, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.75, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.05, BCCI [-0.75, 1.04] nor repair: 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic> = 0.39, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.30, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.18, BCCI [-0.35, 1.13]). However, spatial distance and description abstractness did not interact to affect self-conscious (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.89, index of moderated mediation, self-change = 0.04, BCCI [-0.49, 0.65], repair = 0.02, BCCI [-0.33, 0.46]) or basic emotions (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.54, index of moderated mediation, self-change = 0.1, BCCI [-0.18, 0.6], repair = 0.1, BCCI [-0.18, 0.52]). These results indicate that description abstractness and spatial distance exert multiplicative effects on emotion-regulation strategies only directly.
