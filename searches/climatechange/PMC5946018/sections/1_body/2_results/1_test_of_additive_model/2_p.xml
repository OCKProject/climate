<p class="p">Partially supporting H1, abstractly described consequences, when entered as independent variable, positively influenced both willingness to self-change, 
 <italic class="italic">ab</italic> = 0.34, BCCI [0.06, 0.71], and repair, 
 <italic class="italic">ab</italic> = 0.22, BCCI [0.05, 0.46], via a positive influence on self-conscious emotions, β = 0.54, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.02, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.39. Partial standardization of these indirect effects reveal that abstract consequence description (via its influence on self-conscious emotion) increased willingness to self-change and repair by 0.15 and 0.12 standard deviations, respectively (which may exemplify small effects). Yet, in contrast to H1, spatial distance, when entered as independent variable, did not influence self-conscious emotion (β = 0.04, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.87, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.03). The R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> for the total effect model was 0.009 for self-change and 0.001 for repair. Refuting H2, basic emotions were influenced neither by description abstractness (β = 0.26, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.27, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.19) nor by spatial distance (β = 0.09, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.70, 
 <italic class="italic">d</italic> = 0.06) and were unrelated to distancing attempts (β = 0.03, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.78, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> = 0.02).
