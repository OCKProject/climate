<p class="p">Risk communication on climate change has increasingly focused on emotion and related emotion-regulation strategies (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McDonald et al., 2015</xref>). Emotions are generally felt less intense with increased psychological distance to the emotion-eliciting event. Conversely, when people experience intense emotions, they typically perceive the emotion-eliciting event to be psychologically proximate (e.g.,

 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). However, whether emotional intensity is increased by psychological proximity, may depend on what type of emotion is experienced. For example, although basic emotions like fear and anger may involve proximal threats (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Giner-Sorolla, 2001</xref>), self-conscious emotions like shame or guilt seem to require taking a psychologically (in this case socially) distant perspective, seeing oneself from another person’s perspective and judging whether ones’ actions are appropriate or not (
