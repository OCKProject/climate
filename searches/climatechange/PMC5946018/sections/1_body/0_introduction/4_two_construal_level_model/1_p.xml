<p class="p">The first is the additive model, in which spatial distance and description abstractness each can have an independent effect and contribute to a high or low construal level (see e.g.,

 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Henderson et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, an abstract description of a spatially distant consequence, – i.e., when psychological distance and description abstractness are fitted – should yield the highest (most abstract) construal level, while a concrete description of a spatially proximate consequence, also representing a fitted description, should yield the lowest (most concrete) construal level. Mismatched descriptions (e.g., concrete description of spatially distant consequence) would on the other hand imply an intermediate construal level in the additive model
