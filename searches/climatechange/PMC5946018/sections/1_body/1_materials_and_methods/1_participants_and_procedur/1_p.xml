<p class="p">One hundred and thirty nine individuals (Age 
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 29.8, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 10.1, 64.7% females), recruited from a participant pool at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden, completed an online survey, without receiving monetary compensation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 2 (spatial distance: Proximal vs. Distal) × 2 (description: Concrete vs. Abstract) between-groups design, using Qualtrics Survey Software. Each participant read one of four scenarios describing consequences of climate change and then watched a short video clip depicting a severe rainstorm in a suburban area. In the spatially close condition, participants read that the storm affected Sweden, while participants in the distal condition read that the storm affected Canada (a geographically distant country, but comparable in terms of climate zone and geo-political situation). Consequence description was framed as concrete by describing tangible consequences of climate change (e.g., heat waves and flooding) that would affect Sweden/Canada or abstract by describing intangible consequences of climate change (e.g., an increase in mean global temperature and a rise of mean sea-level) that would affect Sweden/Canada. Moreover, in the concrete versus abstract scenario descriptions respondents were asked to think about 
 <italic class="italic">how</italic> (for concrete) versus 
 <italic class="italic">why</italic> (for abstract) climate change consequences will affect Sweden/Canada. The use of 
 <italic class="italic">how</italic> (making respondents think about the specific process of climate change impact) and 
 <italic class="italic">why</italic> (making respondents think about the cause of climate change impact) questions is a common practice when priming a low and high-level construal, respectively (e.g., 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Freitas et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Liberman and Trope, 2008</xref>). After reading the scenario description and watching the video, participants were asked to think about the previously mentioned climate change consequences and then answered questions about how intensely they experienced 15 different emotions (shame, guilt, embarrassment, pride, anger toward oneself, anger toward others, sadness, fear, disappointment, worry, helplessness, interest, joy, relief, hope) presented in random order (
 <italic class="italic">1 - not at all intense</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic> – 
 <italic class="italic">very intense</italic>) and the eleven emotion-regulation questions (see 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lickel et al., 2014</xref> for complete list of items) measuring self-change, repair or distancing (also presented in random order). The emotion-regulation questions were modified to specifically attain to the question of climate change. For example, self-change was measured by items like “
 <italic class="italic">I feel the need to change myself when I think about climate change</italic>,” repair was measured by items like “
 <italic class="italic">I feel that I should apologize for my own impact on climate change</italic>” and distancing by items like “
 <italic class="italic">I want to distance myself from the issue of climate change as much as possible</italic>,” all measured on a 1–9 Likert scale (
 <italic class="italic">1 – strongly disagree</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">9 – strongly agree</italic>). Finally, as a manipulation check, participants were asked to rate the statement “
 <italic class="italic">I felt like the storm [in the video-clip] was happening far away from Me.</italic>” on a 1–9 Likert scale (
 <italic class="italic">1 – strongly disagree</italic> to 
 <italic class="italic">9</italic> – 
 <italic class="italic">strongly agree</italic>).
