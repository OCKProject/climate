<p class="p">To check whether participants in the spatially distant condition perceived the storm to be further away and participants in the spatially close condition perceived it to be closer, we performed a one-way ANOVA, with spatial distance as independent variable and spatial perception as dependent variable. The difference between Sweden (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 3.34, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 2.24) and Canada (
 <italic class="italic">M</italic> = 3.52, 
 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> = 2.55) was in the expected direction but lacked statistical significance, 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>(1,136) = 0.19, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.67. Note that the manipulation check only pertains to how distant the storm in the video-clip was perceived, not the separate consequence descriptions that either affected Sweden or Canada. It is thus possible that spatial distance was manipulated at both earlier and later stages only in the text scenario descriptions, which our question did not check for.
