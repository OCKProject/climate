<p class="p">First, a scale for self-conscious emotions was created (cf. 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tracy and Robins, 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Agerström et al., 2012</xref>), containing emotions of shame, guilt, embarrassment, anger toward oneself and pride. The scores for pride were inverted before entered into the scale, due to it being a positive self-conscious emotion. The scale had acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.77; see 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nunnally, 1978</xref>). Second, a scale for basic emotions was constructed (cf. 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Arnold, 1960</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Frijda, 1986</xref>), containing the emotions sadness, anger toward other, fear, disappointment, worry, helplessness, relief, joy and interest. The scores for positive emotions were inverted. The scale showed acceptable internal reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.78). Finally, the scales for motivation to self-change, repair and distancing (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lickel et al., 2014</xref>) were tested for internal reliability. The scale for repair showed lower reliability, (Cronbach’s α = 0.66, 3 items), while the scale for self-change (Cronbach’s α = 0.86, 4 items) distancing both showed acceptable reliability (Cronbach’s α = 0.76, 4 items).
