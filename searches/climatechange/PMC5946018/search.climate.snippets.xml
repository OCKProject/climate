  <result pre="risk communication is often based on the notion that making" exact="climate" post="change appear more proximal in space and time would"/>
  <result pre="However, recent research has suggested that simply communicating risks of" exact="climate" post="change as geographically closer might not in itself increase"/>

  <result pre="Robins, 2004). Self-conscious emotions can thus prove especially important for" exact="climate" post="change risk communication, as it enables people to act"/>
  <result pre="act on the long-term goal of combating negative consequences of" exact="climate" post="change. There is also previous evidence suggesting that basic"/>
  <result pre="emotions have been linked to regulation strategies like distancing from" exact="climate" post="change threat ( Lorenzoni et al., 2006; O’Neill and"/>
