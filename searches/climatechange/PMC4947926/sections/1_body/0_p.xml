<p class="p">Savanna-forest complexes occupy nearly 20% of the Earth’s land surface
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>, are responsible for 30% of the Earth’s terrestrial primary production and play an important role in global carbon budgets
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2" class="xref">2</xref>. Anthropogenic climate change is anticipated to have a significant influence on the ecology and distribution of tropical ecosystems, though the magnitude, rate and direction of these changes are uncertain
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3" class="xref">3</xref>. These uncertainties reflect the competing influences of moisture availability, CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6" class="xref">6</xref>. For example, although the dominant factor controlling the potential amount of woody cover in savanna ecosystems is precipitation, actual woody cover is controlled by landscape disturbance, much of which is attributable to fire
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7" class="xref">7</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref>. The establishment of woody plants in fire-prone tropical grasslands depends on both the frequency of fires and growth rates by affecting whether plants can achieve sufficient stem diameters and heights to survive subsequent fires
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>. In ecosystems with frequent fires or slow growth rates, woody plants may be unable to escape this “fire trap” despite increases in moisture availability. Changes in CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> may alter these relationships by changing the carbon available for woody plant growth
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10" class="xref">10</xref>, and increased CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> has been shown to increase growth rates, leading to increased survivability in the presence of fire
