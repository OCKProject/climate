<p class="p">The Lake Bosumtwi record highlights the competing roles of climate, fire and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> on the long-term stability and evolution of grasslands and forests of tropical West Africa. In agreement with many studies of modern tropical grassland ecosystems, frequent fires played a crucial role in excluding woody plants during glacial to late glacial times, even as precipitation and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increased

However, this also resulted in a state of disequilibrium between climate and vegetation, leading to an abrupt vegetation response to changes in climate. In contrast, dramatically increased aridity and fire in the late Holocene did not cause a substantial increase in drought-tolerant C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> grasses, suggesting that tropical forests became more resilient to changes in climate and disturbance. We propose that this is a consequence of high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and biogeophysical feedbacks, which resulted in conditions more favorable for C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plant growth and recovery, stabilizing existing forest cover despite the increased aridity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). We hypothesize that, as with the late glacial grasslands, this has resulted in a dynamically unstable climate-vegetation state that is susceptible to rapid transitions between C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plant-dominated landscapes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Although elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> should continue to act as a stabilizing element, at higher CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> the advantages for C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants decrease
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>, limiting its ability to stabilize these systems and increasing the potential for an abrupt collapse of tropical forest ecosystems in response to increased aridity. The sensitivity of these ecosystems to slight perturbations in climate today is evident in the Dahomey Gap, just to the east of Lake Bosumtwi, where precipitation is only 200–400 mm yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> lower than Bosumtwi but the natural landscape is dominated by grasslands with only isolated patches of forest
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. Here, vegetation records indicate that small increases in rainfall resulted in wholesale return of forest cover briefly in the late Holocene
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref>. In the future, much of West Africa could become more arid, provided that projected increases in precipitation are insufficient to overcome a net drying of soils driven by increased temperature
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>. Such gradual changes in hydroclimate and fire could potentially overwhelm the natural buffering capacity of high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and allow current climate-vegetation stability to give way to rapid forest-savanna transformation in a region that is already a mosaic of these two land-cover types.
