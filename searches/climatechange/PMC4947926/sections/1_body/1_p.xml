<p class="p">To better understand the stability of tropical forest-savanna systems, we use the sediment record from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana, which is located in the lowland tropical forest, several hundred kilometers south of the modern-day savanna-forest boundary (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). We reconstruct changes in vegetation and hydrology using the carbon and hydrogen isotope composition of sedimentary leaf wax 
 <italic class="italic">n-</italic>alkanes (δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub>, δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub>). Changes in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C are interpreted as reflecting changes in the relative proportions of plants using the C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> photosynthetic pathways
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>. C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> vegetation includes most woody plants and winter season grasses with average δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values that are as low as −36‰, whereas most summer or dry season C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> grasses have δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C values of around −20‰
