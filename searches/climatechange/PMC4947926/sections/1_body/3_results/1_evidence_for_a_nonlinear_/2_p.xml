 <sub class="sub">wax,</sub> shows that these grasslands were insensitive to temporarily increased precipitation. The fire proxies also show that at this time, significant landscape-scale fires occurred at annual to interannual timescales. Our evidence for extensive grasslands across tropical Africa at this time with a high frequency of burning is supported by both vegetation synthesis and modeling studies
