<p class="p">The Lake Bosumtwi record shows that the climate, fire and ecological regimes of tropical West Africa changed significantly over the past 28,000 years. During the early part of the record (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3A</xref>; 15,000–28,000 yr BP), δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> values were positive, indicating more arid conditions, fire was more frequent and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> values were higher (−17.3 to −20.6‰) indicating that the landscape was dominated by drought-tolerant C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> summer grasses with only minor contributions from C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> woody plants that burned almost annually. In comparison with the rest of the record, δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> values show little variability, despite significant variations in δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> and fire at this time. After ca. 15,100 yr BP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>, blue dashed line), more depleted δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> values indicate a gradual return to more humid conditions. These are accompanied by a decline in the frequency of fires, which disappear almost entirely for much of the most humid portion of the Holocene (i.e., 10,000–3,200 yr BP). However, in contrast to the gradual nature of these changes in precipitation and fire, the δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> record suggests that the vegetation response was abrupt, with a ~25% change in the proportion of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> woody plants in &lt;150 years. The rapid expansion of woody plants also occurs ca. 300 years after the onset of wetter conditions (at 14,800 yr BP), at the time when fire frequency had declined from nearly annual to one fire every five years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3B</xref>, green dashed line). Over much of the remainder of the record, the landscape around Lake Bosumtwi was dominated by a variable mix of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> and C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plants suggestive of an open woodland or forest environment similar to today, though the data also suggest a trend towards an increasing proportion of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants over the past 14,500 years. Coherent variations in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> and δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub>, during this period indicate that the dominant control over changes in the relative proportions of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>/C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> plants was precipitation, as expected in the absence of fire disturbance. After ca. 3200 yr BP, δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> values suggest that conditions became significantly more arid, and were accompanied by an increase in fire. Nevertheless, fire frequency during the late Holocene was much lower than during the late Pleistocene (27 to 15 ka), and the magnitude of the fire response recorded in the levoglucosan and particulate charcoal records differ, suggesting a distinctly different fire regime. Unlike the earlier part of the record, severe late Holocene aridity (∆δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> = ~17‰) was associated with only minor changes in δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub>, (∆δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> = ~2–3‰) indicating that woody plant-dominated ecosystems persisted despite these environmental changes.
