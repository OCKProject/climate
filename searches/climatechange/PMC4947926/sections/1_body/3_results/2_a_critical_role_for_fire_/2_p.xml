<p class="p">Following the initial expansion of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants and for much of the remaining record, the frequency and intensity of fire remained low, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> was high and increasing, and vegetation responded on centennial to millennial timescales to changes in precipitation, with greater proportions of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants accompanying wetter conditions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). However, this interval is also characterized by an overall trend towards greater C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plant abundance and a decrease in the sensitivity of vegetation to changes in precipitation. We hypothesize that this reflects the influence of increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, which favors the growth of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants relative to C
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> grasses
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. These effects would also have been enhanced by biogeophysical feedbacks; well-developed forests can act to suppress the growth and colonization of grasses by reducing ground light availability, maintaining higher sub-canopy humidity and keeping temperatures lower, all of which promote the growth of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants and are capable of maintaining forest stability
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>, even as environmental conditions change.
