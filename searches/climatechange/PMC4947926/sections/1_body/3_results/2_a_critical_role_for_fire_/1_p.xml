<p class="p">We propose that the high fire frequency early in the record is also the proximate cause of the abrupt and delayed expansion of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plants at 14,800 yr BP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The rapid shift in vegetation occurred when precipitation was similar to earlier (&gt;18,000 yr BP) and later (&lt;3000 yr BP) periods when no systematic vegetation change happened, demonstrating that vegetation was not responding to changes in precipitation alone (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Instead, the abrupt vegetation change reflects a threshold response to the interactions between gradually declining fire frequency, increasing CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and increasing precipitation. The abruptness of this transition likely reflects a combination of the equilibration of C
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> plant composition with available moisture and a feedback between woody plant expansion and a further reduction in the spread of subsequent grassland fires. Support for a threshold mechanism in controlling the vegetation response is also consistent with the ~300 year lag between the initial changes in δD
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub> and δ
 <sup class="sup">13</sup>C
 <sub class="sub">wax</sub>, and the transition from a system where vegetation is unresponsive to changes in precipitation (&gt;14,800 yr BP) to one where the dominant control on vegetation is precipitation (14,800–3,000 yr BP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>). Although other abrupt changes in vegetation occur in the record at ca. 11,500 yr BP and 5700 yr BP, these lack the characteristics indicative of a threshold vegetation response (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Information Fig. S4</xref>). For example, neither show clear evidence for a lag in the timing of the vegetation response to climate, nor is there evidence of changing sensitivity of the vegetation to environmental conditions. Both of these are evident in the shift at 14,800 yr BP.
