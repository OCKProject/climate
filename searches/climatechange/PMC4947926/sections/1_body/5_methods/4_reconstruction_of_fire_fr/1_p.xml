<p class="p">Paleofire was reconstructed from a combination of microscopic particulate charcoal counts and frequency analysis of charcoal layers visually identified in sediment thin sections under transmitted light (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>). Particulate charcoal fragments above 10 μm were counted on slides prepared for palynological analysis. A minimum of 2000 charcoal particles were counted per sample and abundance relative to an exotic marker,

 <sup class="sup">2</sup>/yr) using the same approach as for levoglucosan. Fire frequency was estimated using visual identification of annual charcoal layers in sediment thin sections under transmitted light. Previous work on the laminations from Lake Bosumtwi has demonstrated that they are annual in nature and visible charcoal occurs as a distinct layer within many of the annual laminations, suggesting that the charcoal is deposited after seasonal fire events, rather than being remobilized material from fires occurring in previous years. Charcoal layer frequency analysis was performed on a single continuous set of thin sections spanning the record. Reproducibility was assessed via replication over a several short, overlapping intervals.
