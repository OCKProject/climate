 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. It is based on a combination of radiocarbon dating, Bayesian age depth modeling and varve counting. The chronology consists of 107 radiocarbon dates on bulk organic matter and macrofossils covering the upper 21.4 meters of sediment. Dates from different cores were correlated using marker laminae matches and Bayesian age depth modeling was performed using the R software package BACON
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref> and using the IntCal09 radiocarbon calibration curve
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. Over the deglacial section of the core, we revised the age model by wiggle matching the uncalibrated radiocarbon ages to the IntCal09 calibration curve using the varves as a constraint on the time elapsed between radiocarbon age. An optimal fit was determined using Χ
