<p class="p">Sediment samples (1–5 g) were freeze dried, homogenized and solvent-extracted by either accelerated solvent extraction (Dionex ASE 200) or a microwave extraction (MARS) using dichloromethane:methanol (9:1; v/v). 
 <italic class="italic">n-</italic>alkanes and levoglucosan were isolated from the total lipid extract by silica gel column chromatography. 
 <italic class="italic">n-</italic>alkanes were additionally isolated by silver nitrate silica gel chromatography and molecular sieve or urea adduction. Stable carbon and hydrogen isotope analysis of the long chain n-alkanes was performed by gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-IR-MS). Description of the methods for δD

Identification of the trimethylsilyl ether derivative of levoglucosan was identified in the mass scan by its characteristic fragments (m/z 363, 333, 217, 204) and its retention time determined with an authentic standard. Quantification was performed using an internal standard (androstanol). Levoglucosan concentrations (ppm) were normalized to time (ppm/yr) using varve counts over the laminated intervals of the core and using the Bacon age-depth model over the unlaminated sections.
