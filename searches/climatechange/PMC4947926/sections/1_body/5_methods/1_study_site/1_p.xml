<p class="p">Past variations in the climate, vegetation and fire history of West Africa were reconstructed using the sediment geochemical record from Lake Bosumtwi, Ghana. Lake Bosumtwi is a small (~8 km diameter), internally draining lake occupying a meteorite impact crater in southern Ghana (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The lake is deep (~75 m depth asl) and sheltering by the crater walls inhibit mixing, leading to stratification and permanently anoxic bottom waters. This limits bioturbation and allows for the preservation of mm-scale laminations that have been demonstrated to be annual

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>. The regional climate is controlled primarily by the West African monsoon, which brings moisture to southern Ghana in May-September when the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrates to the north (
