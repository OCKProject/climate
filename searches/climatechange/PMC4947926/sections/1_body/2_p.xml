<p class="p">Changes in fire frequency are estimated from layer counts of distinct charcoal laminae within the annual sediment laminations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>). Because the charcoal occurs as layers and is composed mostly of relatively intact fragments, we interpret the charcoal layers as reflecting the seasonal transport of charcoal to the lake from dry season fires with little or no time lag. We then use the frequency of charcoal layers as a proxy for annual fire frequency. Reconstructions of fire frequency are supported by fire reconstructions from concentrations of levoglucosan, a byproduct of cellulose combustion, and sediment particulate charcoal counts in pollen slides. Previous studies have shown that particulate charcoal

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref> can provide reliable indicators of paleofire in some sedimentary archives and Lake Bosumtwi is an ideal location for preservation of the fire marker levoglucosan because of its permanent bottom water anoxia and well-preserved organic matter
