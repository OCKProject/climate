  <p class="p">Photomicrographs showing changes in the frequency of charcoal laminations in transmitted light sediment thin section from (
   <bold class="bold">A)</bold> the late Holocene (~1500 yr BP) when discrete bands of charcoal are absent, (
   <bold class="bold">B)</bold> the deglacial transition (~14,600 yr BP) when charcoal frequency has started to decline, (
   <bold class="bold">C)</bold> the glacial (~18,200 yr BP) when charcoal bands occur almost annually. Varves are evident in the millimeter to sub-millimeter scale couplets of light and dark laminae. The charcoal appears as distinct black layers in the boundaries of some of the annual laminae.
