 </sup>. To develop climate scenarios, multi-model ensembles of General Circulation Models (GCMs) are used, which define the uncertainty in projections resulting from structural differences in the GCMs, as well as uncertainties in variations of initial conditions or parameterizations

 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>

 <sup class="sup">

 </sup>. By empirically associating local-scale variables with large-scale atmospheric variables produced by GCMs, WG-based downscaling techniques underpin studies on regional and local-scale impact assessments. With weather generation, changes to climate obtained from GCM × RCP combinations are employed to alter the generator parameters for the site baseline to generate synthetic daily weather data for the future
