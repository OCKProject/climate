 </sup> were used to reproduce the baseline weather series (1986â€“2005). Although the WGs used in this study are only a subset of those available, we think that the three WG types considered here are reasonably representative of current approaches to stochastic generation. The realism of stochastically generated precipitation and air temperature time-series with respect to the reference baseline was checked and portrayed with an array of 33 climatic metrics. They include 27 metrics defined by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices/Climate Research Division (ETCCDI/CRD)

 </sup>). The calculation of climatic and agro-climatic metrics helped to synthesize the information conveyed by alternative weather sources. For each metric, we first calculated site-specific cumulative distributions (exceedance probability) for the reference baseline and for the baselines estimated with each WG. Then, we integrated the overlapping area of two empirical cumulative distributions (with probability equal to one in case of perfect overlap and zero in the absence of any overlap). Third, matching the values of overlapping areas, we got the overall distribution for the whole set of metrics. In this way, one indicates perfect overlap for all the metrics. The second and third steps were repeated for the comparison of downscaled future climate projections. The effect of weather generation in the downscaling process was assessed based on the impact of downscaled climate change scenarios on rice yield estimates by using the output of a crop simulator (WARM
