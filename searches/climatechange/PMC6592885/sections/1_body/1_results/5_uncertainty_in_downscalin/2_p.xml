<p id="Par10" class="p">Two main patterns arose: some indices were strongly dependent from all the driving factors (red columns in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>), whereas some factors affected most of the indices (red rows). Besides, some indices, like the cold spell duration index (CSDI), were not significantly driven (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05) by any factor. Evapotranspiration- and rain-related indices (i.e., SAM and rx1day) were the most affected by the factors considered (as highlighted by thick red columns). Some factors, i.e., 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic> × 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">GCM</italic> (red rows), appeared to be the most influential for the majority of climate indices. Overall, 
 <italic class="italic">GCM</italic> was the least significant factor, its average 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value being about 150% larger than for 
 <italic class="italic">Site</italic> and about one order of magnitude larger than for 
 <italic class="italic">WG</italic>. Results also indicated that influential factors are – to a certain extent – uniformly significant (
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.05) across different indices.
