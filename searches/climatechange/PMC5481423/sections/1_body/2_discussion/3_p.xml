<p id="Par15" class="p">So, in contrast to other studies that explored (winter) atmospheric conditions over the Cretan or the Levantine, we investigate whether the transformation of AW into a saltier and warmer LSW in recent decades is likely due to changes in the net evaporation (E-P) over the EMED, and in particular in its southern part. Also continental freshwater input (R) reduction has been considered as a plausible candidate to induce salinification of the Mediterranean waters [e.g ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>]: the construction of major dams during the 1950s was able to produce significant S increases from surface to bottom in the EMED. The reduction of R may also play a role in the formation of warmer and saltier water masses [e.g refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>, such studies indicate that environmental driving forces should also be considered alongside climatic factors. However, the impacts of dam construction are no longer felt after about 40 years

 </sup>. Consequently, damming in the 1950s is not a major influence in the period that we are considering and the cause of the recent changes must be found elsewhere than river runoff. Thus, here we focus on the E-P components of the freshwater budget. The change in the Mediterranean surface E-P field from ERA-Interim, together with E and P component changes, are shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>. The maps show the difference of 2000–2015 from 1990–1999 (these periods are chosen as the time series in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref> reveals a strong increase in salinity values between the 1990s and 2000s). In particular, the E-P increase between the two periods in the south-eastern Mediterranean (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>) is mostly due to an E increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) that is reinforced to some extent by a slight reduction in P (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). The figure shows a change in E-P in the whole southern part of the EMED, that coincides with the eastward pathway of the surface water, a pattern that is consistent with increasing warming and salinification of this layer and a consequent T and S increase in the IW in the SC. Further support for this conclusion is provided by the E-P anomaly time series (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>) for a box that covers the area of the AW pathway in the southern EMED (black outline in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, note the time period 1979–2015 has been selected as it covers all available data from the ERA-Interim reanalysis employed for our investigation). A noticeable switch in the sign of the anomalies is evident in 1998 (coherent with the findings by ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>) and is maintained through to 2014 revealing a prolonged intensification of net evaporation in this region.
