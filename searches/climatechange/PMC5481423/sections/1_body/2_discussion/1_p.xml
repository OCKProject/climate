 </sup>: i.e. the (increased) heat content and salinity of the water masses that contribute to the water mass formation. The (atmospheric and oceanographic) conditions within the formation areas during winter are critical in determining the properties of the water formed in that particular year. In fact, the process of water mass formations is localized in time and space and the newly formed water is rapidly advected out of the area

 </sup>. This is why the long-term forcing that causes the observed overall trends in the LIW/CIW should not be sought in their formation regions, but rather in those regions that contribute to set the “hydrographic” preconditioning, i.e. “upstream” of the formation area. A warmer and drier regional climate in the EMED, as well as a reduced freshwater input from rivers

 </sup>. LSW originates from the modification of AW along its path through the Ionian and the Levantine, where it becomes particularly warm and salty. Hence the climatic conditions along this path are likely to be crucial in eventually determine the heat content and the salinity of Mediterranean IW. In this regard, it is worth noting that
