<p id="Par17" class="p">The ongoing climate change has certainly increased the scientific interest in time series analyses and their importance is increasingly recognized even at the political level. This time series contributes to explicitly show how long oceanographic time series are fundamental for climate studies. Nonetheless, due to their high maintenance costs and the difficulty in establishing and maintaining an observing system they are still widely lacking, both at the global scale and in marginal seas. It is important to stress that an understanding of physical (as well as chemical and biological) processes in the oceans requires regular and long-term observations, that enable us to separate real long-term trends in environmental drivers from the natural variability of the system.</p>
