<p id="Par16" class="p">The increasing import of salt and heat from the EMED to the WMED, via the IW, will have (and already had) significant consequences. Once advected to the dense water formation region in the Gulf of Lion, more salt and heat in the IW will further enhance the tendency of this site to produce warmer and saltier deep waters

 </sup>. The strong changes in the Mediterranean Sea stand out when compared with globally averaged trends, indicating the potential for regional amplification of climate signals. Note that it is also possible that regional modes of climate variability, principally the North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic Pattern, play some role through their impact on regional evaporation and precipitation. However, for the period from the early 1990s to mid 2010s, the NAO and EAP show strong interannual variability in their index values rather than a prolonged trend
