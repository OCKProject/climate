<p id="Par12" class="p">Overall, the 22-year-long record shows a superposition of different time scales of variability: (i) high frequency episodes (daily to annual, not discussed), (ii) prolonged periods (6–7 years) of decreased/increased trends (ascribed to internal variability, exceptionally intense wintertime atmospheric forcings, NIG reversals, EMT), and (iii) longer term increasing trends (&gt;10 years). Now that the time series is growing longer, revealing the ceaseless nature of T and S increases, the effect of global warming (and in particular of “enhanced regional warming in a hot temperature extreme” like the Mediterranean region, see ref.
