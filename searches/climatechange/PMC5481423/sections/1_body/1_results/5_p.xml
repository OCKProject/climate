<p id="Par9" class="p">The period summer 2004 – winter 2010/2011 sees an abrupt end of the increasing trends in the SC. This period follows a long cyclonic phase of NIG, which is the most plausible candidate to explain this behaviour. Since then (winter 2010/11 – spring 2016) the thermohaline trends of LIW/CIW have undergone a dramatic increase, each year reaching higher peaks (during the 22 years the maximum values of T and S were reached in spring 2015, with T
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 14.86 °C, and spring 2016, with S
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> = 38.9, respectively). The T and S trends are now about 2.5 times stronger than the overall trends: 0.064 °C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.014 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. The NIG in 2006–2011 was indeed anticyclonic again, which might have favoured the production of saltier and warmer IW.
