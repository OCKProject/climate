 </sup> prefer to speak about a “thermohaline pump”: a quasi-decadal oscillation between competing dense water formation regions that forces the AW to be mainly advected to the Levantine or the Adriatic. The main difference between these two postulated mechanisms consists in that 
 <italic class="italic">cause</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">effect</italic> are inverted. What matters here is that they act at the same temporal scales and have the same effect on LIW/CIW. This effect seems to be detected in the SC choke point with a temporal lag of about 4–5 years, although this interpretation remains unaddressed yet and deserves further research.
