<p id="Par10" class="p">Previous studies reported much lower trends for the IW in the Mediterranean Sea, e.g ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>. reported mean trends for 1943–2000 of 0.004 °C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.002 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively for T and S, in the WMED. Using only the CTD data collected in the SC (red dots in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), we found slightly (but not significantly) lower trends (0.02  °C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, for T, and 0.005 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, for S), which are still higher that those calculated by ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>. These differences are potentially related to at least three aspects: (i) the trend increased recently, during 2010–2016 (it has more than doubled the longer term trend values), (ii) the SC record provides an “integral“ assessment of what happens in the EMED, while most previous studies were focusing on different regions (mainly of the WMED), where the signal carried by the IW could have been diluted by spreading along different pathways, and (iii) assessing long term trends based on continuous eulerian measurements gives different results to assessments based on sparse, in time and space, CTD casts. Indeed, only the very recent study by ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, analysing CTD data in the Levantine basin from 1979 to 2014, reports trends for LIW T and S that are comparable to those reported here, i.e. 0.03 °C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.005 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>.
