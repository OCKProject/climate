 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>). The S time series does not cover most of this period, but the approximate raise is of the order of 0.05 in 7 years. This period comes immediately after a period of anticyclonic NIG and the augmented trends in the SC are likely to be a response to a warmer and saltier IW production during this phase. In this context, we note that
