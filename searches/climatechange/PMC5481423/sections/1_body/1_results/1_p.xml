<p id="Par5" class="p">The time series of temperature (T) and salinity (S) at 400 m depth show notable interannual variations and long-term trends, with both tracers co-varying (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Since the beginning of the time series (22 years ago), the T of LIW/CIW has increased by about 0.53 °C and its S by about 0.13, thus with mean trends of 0.024 °C yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup> and 0.006 yr
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, respectively. It is evident in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> that the thermohaline trends are subject to changes, slowdowns and accelerations throughout the 22 years, related to a number of forcings, some of which have been explored in previous studies [e.g refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>.] and others that will be discussed here for the first time.
