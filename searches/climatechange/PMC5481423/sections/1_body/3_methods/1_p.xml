<p id="Par18" class="p">The SC site has been monitored for thermohaline properties and water mass exchanges since 1993 by two moorings located within parallel trenches in the 150 km-long transect between Tunisia and Sicily (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>). They form two of the longest Mediterranean time series of thermohaline properties and are part of the HYDROCHANGES network (Mediterranean Science Commission, CIESM)

 </sup>. Due to the Coriolis effect, the IW core at the sill that funnel its westward flow is squeezed to the right, in both trenches (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>), with the 400 m deep record in the north-eastern mooring (called C01) showing slightly warmer (by about 0.04 °C) and saltier (by about 0.01) values than the south-western one (called C02). As the temperature (T) and salinity (S) time series at both sites are very similar only the C02 time series is shown here. As an additional point of reference, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows also the values retrieved by CTD casts performed at the mooring location during each servicing cruise. The nominal depth of the instruments is 400 m, which is however subject to slight variations between servicing of the mooring, of the order of few tens of meters.
