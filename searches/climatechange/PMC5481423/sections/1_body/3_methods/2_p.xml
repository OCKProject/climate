<p id="Par19" class="p">From 1993 to November 2002 temperature and conductivity have been recorded by means of Aanderaa RCM7 current meters, with an accuracy of 0.05 °C and 0.05 for T and S, respectively. Since November 2002, SBE37 probes have been used, which further improved the quality of the measurements, yielding 0.002 °C and 0.001 for T and S, respectively. Both types of instruments (RCM and SBE) have been regularly calibrated (at least on an annual basis). The order of magnitude of the changes observed over the 22 years is such that the difference in accuracy does not affect the computation of trends. These trends have been computed using linear regression on monthly means and t-tested for significance (α = 0.01) using MATLAB®. In order to detect short-term trends, a change-point analysis

 <sub class="sub">min</sub> longer than 5 years instead would not be consistent with the selected k
 <sub class="sub">max</sub> considering the length of the time-series. Due to substantial gaps in the S time-series, the change points detected based on T time-series have been assumed to be the same for the S time-series.
