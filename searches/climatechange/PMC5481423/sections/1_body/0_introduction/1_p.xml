<p id="Par2" class="p">Because of their small volume to surface area ratio, marginal seas tend to respond to global warming and to changes in freshwater inputs (via evaporation-precipitation-river runoff, E-P-R) much more strongly than the open ocean. The Mediterranean Sea (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>) is an outstanding example for this: it has much shorter turnover timescales (1/10th) than the global ocean

 </sup> and it is an evaporation-dominated region for which a further decrease in precipitation is projected in the twenty-first century as a result of anthropogenic climate change

 </sup>. In addition, the second half of the twentieth century has seen a high rate of dam constructions for Mediterranean rivers, the building of the Aswan Dam in 1964 being the most impactful intervention, which greatly reduced (by about 50%, according to ref.
