 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B and C</xref>), a key choke point, where all water masses exchanged between Eastern Mediterranean (EMED) and Western Mediterranean (WMED) can be intercepted. This makes it possible to observe the variability of heat and salt carried by the most ubiquitous Mediterranean water mass, the Intermediate Water (IW), which forms in the EMED and flows towards the WMED, eventually exiting towards the Atlantic Ocean.
