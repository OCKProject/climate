<p id="Par4" class="p">The inflow of fresh surface Atlantic Water (AW), the evaporation excess over the basin and strong heat losses during winter in specific areas, drive an antiestuarine circulation, i.e. a circulation characterized by the inflow of low-salinity surface water over a deeper outflowing, dense, high-salinity water layer (the IW). As the AW spreads through the basin it is modified: in the EMED it is transformed into salty and warm IW, called Levantine Intermediate Water (LIW) or Cretan Intermediate Water (CIW), depending on the specific formation location (Levantine or Cretan Sea, respectively, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>). The formation of these water masses is driven by wind-induced strong evaporation and heat loss during winter, both processes increasing the density of the surface layer until it sinks via convection to an intermediate depth (about 150–300 m)

 </sup>. The LIW/CIW layer is identifiable in the whole Mediterranean Sea by a subsurface S maximum. While flowing back towards the WMED, crossing the SC, it tends to gradually lose its characteristics, due to dilution with adjacent water masses, becoming thus less salty and less warm (and less oxygenated due to respiration processes). After the SC the LIW/CIW is topographically forced to steer north-eastward and enter directly the Tyrrhenian Sea, and eventually reaches the northern WMED. The role of LIW/CIW is crucial in determining the amount and characteristics of the deep waters

 </sup>, that are formed in and ventilate both the EMED and the WMED (see locations in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>). The heat and salt content of the IW preconditions the formation process and in the long-term determines the thermohaline characteristics of the deep waters. Finally, the LIW/CIW forms the bulk of the Mediterranean Outflowing Water (MOW), which exits through Gibraltar and settles down to about 1000 m in the Atlantic due to its high density. Multidecadal salinity increases of the order of 0.0013 yr
