   <bold class="bold">A</bold>) The Mediterranean Sea where deep (yellowish ellipses) and intermediate (reddish ellipses) water formation sites are highlighted as well as the circulation schemes for the Atlantic Water (AW, light blue arrow) and the Levantine/Cretan Intermediate Waters (LIW/CIW, red arrow), the black rectangle indicates the monitored area; (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>) zoom on the Sicily Channel where the positions of the two moorings (C01 and C02) are shown (red diamonds), that allow both branches of the bifurcated LIW/CIW flow (red arrow) to be intercepted; (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) vertical schematic section of the 150 km-long transect between Tunisia and Sicily (black line in (
   <bold class="bold">B</bold>)), showing the two-layer system of water masses flowing in opposite directions (AW in light blue flowing eastward; IW in orange flowing westward, where the darker orange indicates higher salinity, the salinity maximum identifying the core of the IW) and the positions of instruments along the C01 and C02 lines located in two parallel deep trenches. The data discussed in the paper come from the conductivity-temperature sensors at about 400 m depth, located in the intermediate water (IW) (the yellow stars). Maps were generated by using MATLAB 7.1
