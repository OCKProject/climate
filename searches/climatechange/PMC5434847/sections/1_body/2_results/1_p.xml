<p class="p">We predicted the potential distributions of 16 EFS in China under current, low, and high concentration scenarios (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref>: Fig. S1). Based on AUC values, our prediction model performed well for all species: the AUC value of each species was over 0.9 (mean value, 0.974; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). We also found that there was a significant relationship between the mean predicted species richness of grids and the observed species richness in PAs (

 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between priority ranking of all EFS and temperature seasonality (
