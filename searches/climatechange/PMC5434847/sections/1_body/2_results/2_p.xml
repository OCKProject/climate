<p class="p">We found that the regions with high priority ranking for all EFS were distributed throughout southern China (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This is consistent with the present-day distribution of occurrence localities of species we collected. Tawushan (Sichuan), Taitung Hungyeh Village Taiwan Cycas (Taiwan), Yushan (Taiwan), Chuyunshan (Taiwan), and Nanlin (Hainan) PAs had high priority rankings for all EFS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>a). These PAs are projected to effectively converse EFS. Furthermore, these PAs exhibit low temperature seasonality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>b). We found that national parks and protected areas that permit the sustainable use of natural resources have a higher priority ranking for all EFS than strict nature reserves, habitat/species management areas, and protected landscapes/seascapes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The PAs of habitat/species management areas have the lowest priority rankings for all EFS (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>).
