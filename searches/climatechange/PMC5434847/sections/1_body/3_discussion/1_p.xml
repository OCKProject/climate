<p class="p">This study establishes a large-scale evaluation system for EFS based on the predicted impact of climate change. We suggest the use of robust results of potential species distributions to identify appropriate protected areas for EFS under different climate change models. To achieve this objective, we used two test methods for the potential EFS distributions. First, AUC provides important references that were used to assess the performance of Maxent, and then we tested the robustness of predicted species richness modeled by Maxent at the PA scale based on the relationship between predicted species richness and observed species richness of PAs (Pouteau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the relationship between the predicted species richness of grids and the observed species richness is robust at the grid scale (Royle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">2012</xref>; Cao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">2013</xref>; Pouteau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">2015</xref>). However, the limits of occurrence locality data could not perfectly support this test method at the grid scale (Chen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2013</xref>). Hence, in addition to our main objectives, we also validated that the predicted species richness based on projected species distributions was robust at the PA scale.
