<p class="p">Conservationists and government managers have begun to integrate climate change into conservation management (Lawler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2009</xref>; Heller and Zavaleta 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2009</xref>; Dawson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>). This is likely a consequence of the increased understanding that climate change could drive potential distributions of plant species out of existing PAs, such that these PAs could lose their function of conserving endangered species (Araújo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>). Previous studies have shown that the assessment of the ability of existing PAs to conserve endangered plant species can be an effective reference for enhancing the conservation of endangered plant species (Araújo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>; Wan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>). Accordingly, action is required to establish conservation areas of low climate vulnerability for EFS in existing PAs (Gillson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, the conservation functions of many existing Chinese PAs are primarily intended to protect forest ecosystems and endangered animals (

There is a substantial opportunity to utilize these existing PAs to conserve EFS. We should therefore focus on national parks and protected areas that exhibit a sustainable use of natural resources in China. National parks are similar to wilderness areas in size and in their ecosystem protection function. Protected areas that sustainably use natural resources are focused on establishing mutually beneficial arrangements for nature conservation and the sustainable management of natural resources (

However, these two types of PAs are affected by human disturbance. Hence, in situ conservation areas should be separated from areas with a high density of human activities (Ravenel and Redford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">2005</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>). The PA priority rankings indicate we have selected appropriate PAs—i.e., Tawushan (Sichuan), Taitung Hungyeh Village Taiwan Cycas (Taiwan), Yushan (Taiwan), Chuyunshan (Taiwan) and Nanlin (Hainan)—for conducting detailed EFS investigations and enhancing in situ EFS conservation. In order to continue supporting EFS, these PAs need to have low temperature seasonality. Hence, it is necessary to integrate projected changes in temperature seasonality into the future EFS conservation efforts.
