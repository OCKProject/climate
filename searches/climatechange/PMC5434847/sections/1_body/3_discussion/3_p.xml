<p class="p">Some studies have suggested the expansion of PAs to allow for distribution changes under climate change (Heller and Zavaleta

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2009</xref>; Araújo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>; Dawson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, limited manpower and financial resources constrain the development of additional PAs (Leader-Williams and Albon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">1988</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>). Hence, we need to identify appropriate protected areas for EFS under climate change and develop more protected areas for EFS efficiently (Chen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2007</xref>; Heller and Zavaleta 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2009</xref>). Our results shown in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> indicate the need to establish a network of PAs that facilitate the exchange of EFS among PAs under climate change; conservation planning software could address this need (Di Minin and Moilanen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">2012</xref>; Summers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2012</xref>; Di Minin and Moilanen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2014</xref>). Sharafi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">2012</xref>) used Zonation to identify areas outside of existing PAs that efficiently cover gaps in biodiversity features and appropriately expand conservation areas in Victoria, Australia. This study provides a useful model for conservation efforts in China. Our suggestion is to strongly consider connectivity among existing PAs and to establish conservation areas for EFS in the regions among PAs with high priority rankings.
