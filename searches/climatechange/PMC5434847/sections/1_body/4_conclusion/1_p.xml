<p class="p">Our findings show that with decreasing temperature seasonality, national parks and protected areas in which natural resources are sustainably used had the highest priority ranking for all of the analyzed EFS. To reduce the negative impact of climate change on EFS, we should take immediate actions, such as establishing conservation areas with low climate vulnerability for EFS in existing PAs and expanding conservation areas for EFS into the regions with high priority rankings. We hope to use a large-scale priority ranking evaluation for the areas that are suitable for EFS conservation in order to promote the development of global conservation planning for threatened plant species. However, our study had some limitations, as we required more detailed data on climate and species distributions than was sometimes available. In future research, we will construct more accurate maps of appropriate conservation areas for EFS under climate change with appropriately richer data. Immediate EFS conservation actions should be considered in future worldwide studies.</p>
