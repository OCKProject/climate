<p class="p">Four contemporary bioclimatic variables at a 10-arc-minute spatial resolution (16 km at the equator) were used to model potential distributions of species, and these climatic data were obtained from the WorldClim database (Additional file

The resulting four bioclimatic variables were related to the distribution and physiological performance of plants. Four projected bioclimatic variables, corresponding to the present-day variables, were assessed using the mean grid maps of three global climate models (GCMs), including mohc_hadgem2, csiro_mk3_6_0, and cccma_canesm2 analogue data (corresponding to 2070–2099, or roughly the 2080 s), and obtained from the International Centre for Tropical Agriculture (

Representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 (mean, 780 ppm; range, 595–1005 by 2100; low concentration scenario) and 8.5 (mean, 1685 ppm; range, 1415–1910 by 2100; high concentration scenario) were used to model future potential distributions of species. RCP 8.5 projections differ from RCP 4.5 projections because of higher cumulative concentrations of carbon dioxide and other largely anthropogenic greenhouse gas pollutants that alter the pattern of climate change (
