<p class="p">Maxent settings used in this analysis included the following: (1) the regularization multiplier (beta) was set to 1.5 for producing a smooth and general response that could be modeled in a biologically realistic manner (Shcheglovitova and Anderson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2013</xref>); (2) the maximum number of background points was 10,000 (Merow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>); (3) a fourfold cross-validation approach was used for removing bias with respect to recorded occurrence points, namely, 75 % of occurrence points were used for training and 25 % for the actual test (Li and Guo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">2013</xref>); (4) a jackknife test was used in Maxent to analyze the importance of different climatic factors (Merow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>); and (5) all other settings used were the same as those described by Elith et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>) and Merow et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). We projected the importance of climatic variables to potential distributions of species based on the results of the jackknife test (Merow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>).
