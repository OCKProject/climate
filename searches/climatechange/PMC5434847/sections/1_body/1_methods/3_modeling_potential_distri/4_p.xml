<p class="p">Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves summarize each value of the prediction result as a possible analysis threshold. The precision of the model was evaluated by calculating the area under the ROC Curve (AUC). The models were either graded as poor (AUC &lt; 0.8), fair (0.8 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.9), good (0.9 &lt; AUC &lt; 0.95), or very good (0.95 &lt; AUC &lt; 1.0; Adhikari et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">2014</xref>), we computed predicted species richness under current, low, and high concentration scenarios by superimposing the weighted potential distribution of species for each grid. Then we selected some PAs that currently contain EFS (based on scientific surveys conducted in national nature reserves) and used linear-regression analyses to analyze the relationship between mean predicted species richness of grids and observed species richness in PAs in order to evaluate model precision at the PA scale. A significant relationship between these values is an important precondition for computing the priority ranking of the EFS. Here, we could not use all of the PAs from WDPA because of a lack of data. Hence, we only included the PAs for which species occurrence data was recorded in all data sources (i.e., GBIF, CVH, and scientific research reports by national nature reserves).
