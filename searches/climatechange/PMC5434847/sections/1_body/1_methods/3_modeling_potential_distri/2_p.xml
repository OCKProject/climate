<p class="p">We used Maxent to model the projected EFS distributions in China under climate change (Merow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). All grids were regarded as a possible distribution space according to maximum entropy (Elith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">2011</xref>; Merow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" class="xref">2013</xref>). For the map grids predicted using Maxent, cell values of one represented the highest possibility of containing the species, while values close to zero represented the lowest possibility. Furthermore, projected EFS distribution areas were effectively determined using the contemporary climate conditions of the present-day sites that contain these individual EFS (Warren and Seifert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">2011</xref>).
