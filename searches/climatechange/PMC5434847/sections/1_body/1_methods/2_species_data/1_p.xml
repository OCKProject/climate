<p class="p">EFS were selected from the List of National Key Protected Wild Plants approved by the State Council of China (

Occurrence localities that contain EFS were identified from the following three sources: (1) The Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gbif.org/</ext-link>); (2) the Chinese Virtual Herbarium (CVH; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cvh.org.cn/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.cvh.org.cn/</ext-link>); and (3) 175 scientific research reports detailing national nature reserves (more detailed information is provided in the “Acknowledgements” section). Although some studies did not report the geographical coordinates of some species, we were able to translate the recorded locations of species into latitudes and longitudes using Google Earth and ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri; Redlands, CA, USA) based on (1) the detailed location and habitat descriptions of species from the research reports; (2) vegetation information about species from the 1:1 Million Vegetation Atlas of China (Hou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">2001</xref>); and (3) the locations of species within 10-arc-minute grid cells (equivalent to 16 km at the equator) to avoid any georeferencing errors (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2014b</xref>). These three factors limited the extent of species occurrences to roughly 10-arc-minute grids. Finally, we selected 16 EFS with more than five occurrence localities as the input dataset for SDM (Pearson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">2007</xref>). We could not identify wild populations of some species owing to limited occurrence localities. For practical purposes, we focused on potential distributions of EFS with known wild populations.
