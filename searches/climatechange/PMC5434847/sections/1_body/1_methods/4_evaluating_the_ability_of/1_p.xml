<p class="p">First, we used Zonation software to identify priority conservation areas for EFS in China. Zonation is a publicly available framework and software for grid-based and large-scale spatial conservation prioritization (Meller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2014</xref>). It has been used for evaluating conservation areas and conservation planning under climate change scenarios (Summers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">2012</xref>). Using Zonation, we obtained the priority ranking of each grid for EFS. We focused on the connectivity between the current and future potential EFS distributions (under the low and high concentration scenarios) and considered the influence of climate change on future species richness when selecting potential sites for nature reserves (Lehtomäki and Moilanen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2015</xref>). Using the original core-area cell removal rule, we established spatial priorities and calculated the marginal loss of each grid, which we then used to determine if a conservation goal had been met (i.e., that a given proportion of distributions for all of the species with the high priority ranking would be protected; Lehtomäki and Moilanen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2013</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>). Current and future species richness of EFS were weighted equally in our analysis (including under low and high concentration scenarios), and we used a warp factor of 100 (Wan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">2015</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">2015</xref>). For the grid maps of priority conservation areas under low and high concentration scenarios, 10.0-arc-minutes resolution data were aggregated at 2.5-arc-minutes resolution using ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri; Redlands, CA, USA) to identify priority conservation areas in PAs. We also used ArcGIS 10.2 (Esri; Redlands, CA, USA) to extract and compute the priority ranking of all EFS and the average values of the most important climatic variables for PAs.
