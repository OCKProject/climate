<p class="p">These protection issues can be addressed by the establishment of additional protected areas (PAs; Chape et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2005</xref>; Chen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2007</xref>). The future effectiveness of PAs is limited because climate change could drive endangered plant species out of PAs, resulting in a loss of their conservation function for endangered species (Araújo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2014</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2016</xref>). A number of studies have suggested the integration of climate change into conservation planning for endangered plant species (Hannah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">2002</xref>; Araújo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2011</xref>; Dawson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, studies focusing on EFS conservation in conjunction with climate change are rare. Target seven of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) has shown at least 75 % of known threatened plant species would be conserved in situ from 2011 to 2020 (

However, conservationists and government managers cannot effectively establish more PAs for EFS because of limited funds and manpower (Leader-Williams and Albon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">1988</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2014a</xref>). Hence, it is necessary for conservationists to expand PAs to accommodate EFS, assess the ability of existing protected areas to conserve EFS, and determine the climatic features of these PAs. Thus, we aimed to determine the areas and number of wild EFS populations through field investigations and to plan to appropriately expand protected areas for EFS.
