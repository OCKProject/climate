<p class="p">We used the EFS of China as a case study because (1) EFS are widely distributed across a range of latitudes, (2) China contains a rich diversity of EFS, and (3) EFS conservation management is urgent because there are few PAs supporting EFS in China. The main objective of our study was to identify appropriate conservation areas for EFS under climate change based on conservation priority rankings computed with conservation planning software. To achieve this objective, we performed two tasks: (1) an evaluation of the ability of PAs to conserve EFS under climate change using Zonation (a common conservation planning software tool) and (2) a determination of the climatic features of PAs with high priority rankings. First, we used SDM in Maxent to model the potential distribution of EFS in China under climate change. Second, we used Zonation to plan priority conservation areas for EFS based on this potential distribution. Third, geographical information system (GIS) was used to compute the ability of protected areas to conserve EFS under climate change and explore the relationship between climate change and priority conservation areas in PAs.</p>
