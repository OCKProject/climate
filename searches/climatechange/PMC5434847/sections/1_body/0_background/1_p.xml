<p class="p">Climate change has had a profound effect on biodiversity and can result in the migration, adaption, and extinction of species, as well as make it harder to protect endangered species (Pearson and Dawson

Some studies have shown that changes in population and species structure may alter distributions of species diversity, affect habitats and thus induce responses in the phenotypic plasticity of individuals and populations, and change the distribution or fragmentation of habitats (Jackson and Sax

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" class="xref">2014a</xref>; Chung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">2015</xref>). This ultimately reduces species diversity and results in a loss of biodiversity (Sgro et al.
