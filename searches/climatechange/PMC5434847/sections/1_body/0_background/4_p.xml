<p class="p">Conservation planning software and species distribution modeling (SDM) has been widely used in biological conservation, ecological restoration, and the planning of PAs (Summers et al.

Researchers have predicted the potential geographical distributions of endangered species, determined priority conservation areas for these species, and established a model-based evaluation system for the conservation of biodiversity in PAs by using conservation planning software and SDM (Di Minin and Moilanen

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">2016</xref>). Conservation planning software coupled with SDM could be used to identify appropriate protected areas for EFS and determine priority conservation areas under climate change that are not covered by existing PAs (Di Minin et al.
