<p class="p">In the first step, we aimed to evaluate the impact of projected climate change on pollinators considering all of the abovementioned crops. To this end, we calculated the average potential shift in pollinator occurrence for the whole country. Moreover, we calculated the number of municipalities where each crop is produced that will potentially face an increase or decrease in pollinator occurrence considering the following: i) the GDP (the monetary value of all of the finished goods and services produced within a country's borders in a specific time period) per municipality, ii) the percentage of that particular crop in the GDP per municipality, and iii) the population (number of inhabitants). The value of the GDP and the population per Brazilian municipality were also retrieved from the IBGE website (year 2013).</p>
