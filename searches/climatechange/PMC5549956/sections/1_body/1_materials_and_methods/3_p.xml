<p class="p">In addition to the occurrence points, SDM uses environmental variables to determine suitable areas for species potential distribution. We used climatic variables obtained from Worldclim [

 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]: altitude, mean diurnal range, isothermality, mean temperature of the driest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of the driest month, precipitation seasonality, precipitation of the warmest quarter, and precipitation of the coldest quarter. We used the same variables to forecast the future potential distribution projected by the Met Office Hadley Centre (HadGEM2-CC) and the University of Tokyo and collaborators (MIROC-ESM-CHEM) for the year 2050. We built the ensemble forecasting of both projections, which consists of a weighted sum scheme for merging the final models obtained [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. We used the representative concentration pathways (RCP) set to 8.5, which specifies a likely global mean surface temperature increase by the end of the 21st century of 2.6°C to 4.8°C [

For conservation purposes, it is important to detect the areas that are most suitable, even in more extreme scenarios, minimizing costs and maximizing the chance of effectively protecting the species. This approach was used in previous studies [
