<p class="p">The Maximum Entropy algorithm (Maxent) [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] was used to perform the SDM. This algorithm is particularly useful because it can be applied to datasets using only presence records of species (as opposed to other algorithms that require absence data) [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. We used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver-operator graph to estimate the accuracy of the modeling process in a test data set (20% of the total occurrence data) [
