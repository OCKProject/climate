<p class="p">The main pollinators of 13 Brazilian crops analyzed here were defined in another study, totaling 95 species [

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0182274.s001" class="xref">S1 Table</xref>). The total number of Brazilian crops is still unknown, with most regional fruits and vegetables being produced by only local farmers. A recent assessment evaluated the pollinator dependency of 141 crops, but this is not the total number of Brazilian crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Moreover, there is a lack of information about the pollinator dependency of crops as well a lack of knowledge related to the main crop pollinators [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Additionally, the values of annual production per municipality are not available in the public data repository for all crops (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statisticsâ€”IBGE), and such values are necessary for the estimations proposed here. Thus, this study analyzes 13 crops for which we have already determined the pollinator dependency and the main pollinators and for which we have the values of annual production per Brazilian municipality.
