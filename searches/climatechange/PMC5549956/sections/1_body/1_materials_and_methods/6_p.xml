<p class="p">To evaluate the impact of projected climate change on pollinators in the Brazilian municipalities that produce a particular crop, we merged all models obtained for all pollinator species for each crop considering current conditions and did the same considering future forecasts (the ensemble of the Had and MIROC scenarios). This procedure resulted in one model for the potential distribution of all pollinators under current conditions and one model for the future conditions for each crop. In the subsequent step, we subtracted the values of the future potential distribution (represented as the occurrence probability) from the current one, also per crop. This final model represents the potential shift in pollinator occurrence per pixel and expresses an index that varies from -1 (100% decrease in pollinator occurrence, i.e., no pollinator will occur in that particular pixel) to +1 (100% increase in pollinator occurrence, i.e., all pollinators will occur in that particular pixel).</p>
