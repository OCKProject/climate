<p class="p">We assessed the impact of projected climate change on crop pollinators using species distribution modeling (SDM), a computational technique that determines potential areas of species occurrences and forecasts their future distribution [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. We retrieved information about the occurrence points of each pollinator species from the speciesLink data portal (Centro de Referência em Informação Ambiental, CRIA) and from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data portal. Both repositories contain biodiversity data deposited mainly in biological collections and museums (
