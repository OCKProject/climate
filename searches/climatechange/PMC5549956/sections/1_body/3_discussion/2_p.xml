<p class="p">The predicted effect of climate change will potentially reduce the occurrence of pollinators in most of the municipalities with the lowest GDP. This finding has important implications since it is expected that the effects of climate change will also cause a decline in crop productivity independent of the pollination deficits [

 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]. These joint effects could bring additional reductions in agricultural income in already poor municipalities, reinforcing their socioeconomic vulnerability. Worryingly, the highest decline in the probability of pollinator occurrence is projected to occur in the majority of municipalities (4000 municipalities) in which crop production accounts for the lowest percentage of the total GDP (10%), allowing few possibilities for future agricultural expansion if those areas with currently low production face a future reduction in pollinators. These cities are mainly found in the central and southern areas of Brazil. Municipalities with the highest GDP will also face a reduction in the occurrence of pollinators. However, the socioeconomic impact will be lower since the GDP is not so highly dependent on crop production. Considering this scenario, it is important to delineate strategies aiming to reduce the deficit of crop pollination and, at the same time, enhance crop productivity, promoting a better income for crop producers and helping to minimize further losses of natural areas for agriculture [
