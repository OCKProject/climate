<p class="p">Considering the importance of pollination in crop production, we investigated the potential impact of climate change on the distribution of pollinator bees for some Brazilian crops. We found that the pollinator occurrence probability will decrease in most of Brazil by the year 2050. The highest decrease will potentially be found in the southern areas. In contrast, some northern areas will show a slight increase in the occurrence probability of crop pollinators.</p>
