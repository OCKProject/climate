<p class="p">Future work should consider the impact of climate change on other aspects of Brazilian crop production, such as the reduction or deficiency in the availability of water for irrigation and possible phenology mismatches between flowering and pollinators. Moreover, the impact of climate change on the Brazilian crop itself should be taken into account since production is highly dependent on precipitation and temperature regimes. In addition, new studies could consider the effect of land use changes on agricultural areas in addition to climate. Moreover, climate change can potentially impact pollinator species in other ways, for example, changing the size of their populations, which could have additional impacts on Brazilian crop productivity. Another key factor is related to the quality of the data. More work is necessary to fill knowledge gaps about crops' effective pollinators and animal pollination dependence as well as data on annual crop production on Brazil. Notably, there are few data available about regional crops, whose production is often based on family farming and that are sources of income for the local economy.</p>
