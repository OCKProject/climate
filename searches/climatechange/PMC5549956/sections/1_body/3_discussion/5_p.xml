<p class="p">Here, we propose a comprehensive methodology to analyze the impact of climate change on crop pollinators based on species distribution modeling that can be easily applied to other data, crops or regions. We show that climate change can affect pollinator species differently and that the relative impact on crop production needs to be considered when planning strategies that involve food production for medium- to long-term periods. Conservation strategies for crop pollinators are urgent and deepen the discussions about climate refuges and pollinator-friendly agricultural practices. Biodiversity data involving crop pollinators and production need to be gathered and shared to improve the accuracy of analyses that can ultimately be translated into effective strategies to guarantee the ecosystem services delivered by pollinator species.</p>
