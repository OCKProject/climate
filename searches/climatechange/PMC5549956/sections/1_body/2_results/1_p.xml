<p class="p">The resulting mean potential shift in the pollinator occurrence probability for all analyzed crops (13 crops) shows that projected climate change will likely affect pollinators differently in different regions of Brazil (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>â€”yellow color). A larger decline could occur mostly in the southern areas (orange and red colors). However, some areas, especially in the northern region, will likely experience a small increase in the probability of pollinator occurrence (green color), indicating an increase in the suitability of these regions. Considering all 13 crops, an overall 0.13 (SD = 0.11) average decrease in the pollinator occurrence probability was found as well as a high percentage of municipalities (88%) that will potentially face a decrease in the pollinator occurrence probability, contrasting with a 12% increase (
