<p class="p">Most municipalities will likely face a decline in the probability of pollinator occurrence and also have the lowest GDP (less than R$1bi) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). Few municipalities will potentially face an increase in probability, also presenting low values of GDP (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). However, almost 400 municipalities with higher GDP values (between R$1bi and R$250bi) will face a decline in the probability of pollinator occurrence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2A</xref>). Moreover, for most of the municipalities that will likely experience a decline in pollinator occurrence, crop production represents 10% of the GDP; however, for others, crop production represents higher numbers (20% to 90% of the GDP) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). The percentage of crop production in the total GDP is also low (less than 10%) in the few municipalities that will likely face positive shifts (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2B</xref>). A decline in the probability of pollinator occurrence also correlates with most of the municipalities with fewer than 50,000 inhabitants but also includes some municipalities with the highest number of inhabitants (6 million people) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g002" class="xref">Fig 2C</xref>). However, positive potential shifts were also found in small municipalities (fewer than 40,000 inhabitants) as well as some populous municipalities (2.4 million people).
