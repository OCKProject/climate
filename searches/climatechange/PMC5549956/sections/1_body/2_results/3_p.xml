<p class="p">The potential shift in pollinator occurrence probability related to projected climate change in each Brazilian municipality varies strongly, as does the pattern for the different crops (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0182274.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). The decline in the occurrence probability of the pollinators for each crop varies from 2% (persimmon) to 25% (tomato) (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182274.t001" class="xref">Table 1A</xref>) and can potentially affect from 9% (for mandarin) to 100% (sunflower) of municipalities where each crop is produced (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0182274.t001" class="xref">Table 1B</xref>). Most of the suitable future areas can be found in the northern areas, where almost all crops are produced (except sunflower and cotton). Some pollinators will also likely find potentially suitable areas in the southern areas of Brazil, where avocado, sunflower, tomato, bean, mandarin and persimmon are produced. However, most of the eastern region of Brazil, where many crops are currently produced, will likely experience a decrease in pollinator occurrence probability (except for persimmon). The areas where guava, tomato and coffee are produced will likely face the highest decrease in pollinators. Based on the shift in the pollinator occurrence probability and the crop production of each municipality, our results show that some municipalities with the highest value of production will potentially face important decreases in the pollinator occurrence probability (list of municipalities in
