<p class="p">An additional challenge to agriculture related to climate change is the loss of crop pollinators, with pollination being an ecosystem service that is important to maintain the production of the majority of crops [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Crops have different degrees of dependency on animal pollinators, and a global evaluation showed that 85% (91 of 107 crops) are pollinator dependent to some degree [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]. In Brazil, 60% of crops (85 of 141) are pollinator dependent, with another 39 crops that do not depend on animal pollination and 17 crops lacking data [
