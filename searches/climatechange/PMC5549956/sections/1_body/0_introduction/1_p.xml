<p class="p">One of the key challenges addressed by the World Summit on Food Security is the necessity for countries to properly address the impact of climate change in order to achieve food security [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization), food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to address their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Food security can be affected by climate change because it may change crop growth and production [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], impacting crop price and the food market and exacerbating hunger, land abandonment, migration and urbanization [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. At the global scale, climate change is expected to lead to a 14% decline in per capita cereal production by 2030 [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], particularly affecting tropical areas [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. In Africa and South Asia, 8% yield losses are expected across all crops by 2050 [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], with developing countries being more vulnerable [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>], potentially enhancing the decline in crop productivity, particularly in countries that currently have a high prevalence of hunger [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Brazilian agricultural production is also expected to be affected by climate change. Between 2 and 5 billion US$ is the projected loss to be suffered by 2070, with coffee-growing areas showing a 30% decrease in the southeastern region [
