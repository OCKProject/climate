<p class="p">Climate change is ongoing, involving changes in precipitation and temperature regimes. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), climate change will potentially lead to an average temperature increase of 2°C to 4°C by 2050 depending on the emission scenario [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Declines in pollinators as a result of climate change have already been suggested for honey bees [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>] and bumblebees [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Other species have also shifted their distribution toward the poles [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] or to higher elevations [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] or have exhibited more complex responses [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], seeking milder habitat conditions. Climate change is also affecting the interaction between species [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], changing the structure of interaction networks [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref024" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">24</xref>], resulting in changes in phenological synchronization [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>] and leading to mismatches in the geographic distribution of interacting species [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. In addition, under climate change, the biota tends to show homogenization, with generalist species, which usually have broader abiotic requirements, becoming more prevalent [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>], since species with narrow ecological niches or habitat preferences are likely to disappear [
 <xref rid="pone.0182274.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>].
