<p class="p">The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of projected climate change on the geographic distribution of crop pollinators of 13 Brazilian crops and to estimate its relative impact on crop production. To this end, we analyzed pollinator shifts due to climate change for each crop using species distribution modeling. We evaluated the impact of climate change in each municipality where these crops are produced as well as the total crop production, the gross domestic product (GDP) per municipality and the number of inhabitants.</p>
