Common bean is the most important grain legume staple crop for human diets and nutrition worldwide. We demonstrate by crop modeling that the majority of current common bean growing areas in southeastern Africa will become unsuitable for bean cultivation by the year 2050. We further demonstrate reductions in yields of available common bean varieties in a field trial that is a climate analogue site for future predicted drought conditions. Little is known regarding the impact of climate change induced abiotic stresses on the nutritional quality of common beans. Our analysis of nutritional and antinutritional compounds reveals that iron levels in common bean grains are reduced under future climate-scenario relevant drought stress conditions. In contrast, the levels of protein, zinc, lead and phytic acid increase in the beans under such drought stress conditions. This indicates that under climate-change induced drought scenarios, future bean servings by 2050 will likely have lower nutritional quality, posing challenges for ongoing climate-proofing of bean production for yields, nutritional quality, human health, and food security.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CropBioFort project funded by the Irish Research Council&#x00026;amp;#x2019;s New Foundations program</award-id><award-id>GOIPG/2014/1021</award-id><award-id>GOIPG/2014/1021 and the CropBioFort project</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hummel</surname><given-names>Marijke</given-names></name><name><surname>Hallahan</surname><given-names>Brendan F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Spillane</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CGIAR Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) program</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13/IA/1820</award-id><award-id>13/IA/1820</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brychkova</surname><given-names>Galina</given-names></name><name><surname>Spillane</surname><given-names>Charles</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CIAT Malawi</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Harvest Plus &#x00026;amp; CIAT Colombia</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>CIAT, Colombia</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Dietary deficiencies of micronutrients such as iron and zinc constitute major public health problems globally, particularly amongst women and children in sub-Saharan Africa<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>.

The bean varieties used consisted of varieties commonly cultivated by smallholder farmers and also bean lines developed by the CIAT and PABRA bean breeding programs under consideration for entry into the national varietal registration and official release process. They comprise a range of different market classes (i.e. quality types) including black, red, kidney, mottled red, brown, light brown and white beans, both smaller and larger sized seed varieties. These varieties were chosen to reflect the reality of (a) what bean varieties are actually available to smallholder farmers in Malawi and (b) what bean varieties are in the regulatory pipeline in Malawi that may become accessible to smallholders within the next decade, taking account of the time-lag expected for national varietal registration, certification processes and bulking up of seed by suppliers. The suitability of the field trial site area in western Malawi for common bean cultivation is projected to fall below current suitability levels by 2050, primarily due to decreased precipitation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,C</xref>).</p><p id="Par10">All twenty bean varieties were field trialed under both rainfed conditions and drought-stress conditions that are representative of conditions predicted by EcoCrop modeling to occur by 2050 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). This corresponded to four field trial seasons in total, i.e. two trials under rainfed conditions and two under drought-stress conditions. To ensure seasons could be reliably and reproducibly grouped according to &#x0201c;rainfed&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;drought-stress&#x0201d; conditions, <italic>k</italic>-means cluster analysis was performed on recorded weather data for the field trial site. The identified clusters were analysed using discriminant analysis for the goodness of fit of the model, and t-statistics were applied to verify the predicted <italic>vs</italic>. found mean of the clusters (Supplementary Results File). In addition, to further verify the climate change relevance of our drought-stress growing seasons, Simulated Weather Data for Crop Modelling and Risk Assessment (MarkSim) software V.2 was employed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccafs-climate.org/pattern_scaling/">http://www.ccafs-climate.org/pattern_scaling/</ext-link>). These analyses confirmed that our drought-stress field trial conditions can be considered as a climate analogue site for bean growing seasonal weather conditions in the year 2095 in Malawi, under RCP 8.5. Average temperatures during our drought field trials were 22&#x02009;&#x000b0;C with extremes of 35&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, closely resembling the predicted average temperatures for the bean growing season (March, April and May) of 24&#x02009;&#x000b0;C and extremes of 32&#x02009;&#x000b0;C in the year 2095. Likewise, the average rainfall during the bean grain filling period in 2015 was 54&#x02009;mm, similar to the projected average rainfall of 58&#x02009;mm (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).</p><p id="Par11">To determine whether the reduction in yield of the common bean varieties under drought-stress conditions at the climate analogue trial site was more influenced by genotype (variety) or weather conditions (temperature, precipitation), an F-test was performed.

To determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the varieties under drought stress conditions, a one-way ANOVA was performed, which showed no significant yield difference between the bean genotypes (Supplementary Results File). Similarly, no significant yield differences were identified between the bean genotypes under rainfed conditions (Supplementary Results File). Overall, for all bean varieties that were field trialed at the Malawi climate analogue site, the common bean grain yield decreased by an average of 43% under drought-stress conditions, which is significantly lower (two-tailed independent samples t-test, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) when compared with rainfed conditions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>While iron levels in bean grains decrease, under climate-scenario relevant drought stress conditions, zinc, lead, protein and phytic acid levels increase</title><p id="Par12">Many of the countries analysed in this study have moderate to high child underweight rates (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1E</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.

Only in specific localised zones in northern Zimbabwe, southern and northern Tanzania, and northern Malawi, are increases in climatic suitability for bean cultivation projected. Relocation of bean cultivation to different areas beyond the current range of cultivation may be possible, but in this case careful consideration should be given to choosing varieties suited for the new area, including any change in photoperiod that occurs with changing latitude.

To remove the inorganic phosphate, 10&#x02009;ml diluted samples were applied to the 10&#x02009;ml Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (#7311550, Bio-Rad), pre-packed with 0.3&#x02009;g of AG1-X4 resin, 100&#x02013;200 mesh (AG 1-X4 Resin #1401341, Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 0.7&#x02009;M NaCl, followed by elution with 10&#x02009;ml 0.1&#x02009;M NaCl. Phytate was eluted from the columns with 0.7&#x02009;M NaCl into 15&#x02009;ml Falcon tubes. Each sample was analysed in triplicate to measure phytate with WADE reagent (0.03% FeCl3*6H2O and 0.3% sulfosalicylic acid in Milli-Q water, according to Latta <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref></sup>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Data preparation and statistical analysis</title><p id="Par41">All field trial data points, yield data and nutrient data were organized on Microsoft Excel (Microsoft, WA, USA) and all statistical analysis was performed on SPSS Statistics (version 21) (IBM, NY, USA).
