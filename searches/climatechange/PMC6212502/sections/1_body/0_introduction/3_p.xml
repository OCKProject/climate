<p id="Par4" class="p">In this study, we have used Ecocrop to model the impact of climate change induced changes in heat and precipitation by 2050, on the suitability for cultivation of common bean across a range of countries in southeastern Africa. In addition, we have combined the climate impact modeling with experimental field trials of common bean, under the extent of drought anticipated due to future climate change (by 2050), to determine the impact on both yield and the nutritional quality of common bean under climate-induced drought stress. Our results are important for efforts to climate proof cultivation of the staple crop common bean, so that varieties can be developed, which under drought stress maintain good yields and contain high levels of the dietary micronutrients iron and zinc, while containing low levels of anti-nutritional factors such as lead and phytic acid.</p>
