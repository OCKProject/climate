<p id="Par33" class="p">All twenty bean varieties were field trialed under both rainfed conditions and drought-stress conditions that are representative of conditions predicted by Ecocrop modeling to occur by 2050. The drought and rainfed trials of all bean varieties were conducted between 2013â€“2015 at the Kandiyani site of the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT) Chitedze Research Station, Lilongwe, Malawi. The crop trial was laid out in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three plots/replicates. Two seasons per year the beans were harvested, in the rainy season, plants were grown under natural, rainfed conditions between December and March. The drought trial was conducted in the winter/off-season which lasts from late August until November.</p>
