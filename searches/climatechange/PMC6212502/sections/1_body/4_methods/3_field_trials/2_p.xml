<p id="Par34" class="p">For each plot, four ridges were prepared, measuring 5 m long and spaced at 0.60 m. The net plot comprised of the two middle ridges with the outer ridges acting as borders. One seed was planted per planting station spaced at 0.50 cm. No fertilizer was applied in the trials. Pests and diseases were controlled using Dimethoate (Aryzta LifeScience, South Africa) and Karate (Syngenta, Basel, Switzerland) according to product label recommendations. Agronomic data collected from each plot consisted of; days to 50% flowering; days to 95% physiological maturity; plant height at harvesting; grain weight; total plot yield. Yield was determined by weight of grains.</p>
