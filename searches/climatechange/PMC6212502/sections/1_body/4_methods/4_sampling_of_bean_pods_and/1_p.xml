<p id="Par35" class="p">Bean samples from four harvests in the period 2013â€“2015 were analysed. Bean pods were sampled when mature, from every plot 10 plants were randomly selected and of each of these plants 10 pods were taken (on different sides of the plant and not touching the soil). All procedures were followed according to HarvestPlus protocols for crop sampling to ensure samples were representative and minimize any risk of sample contamination
