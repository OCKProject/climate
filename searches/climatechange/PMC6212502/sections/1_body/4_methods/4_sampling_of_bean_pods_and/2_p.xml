<p id="Par36" class="p">After harvest, all samples were kept in a storage room in CIAT, Malawi at room temperature until transfer to the National University of Ireland Galway (NUI Galway). On arrival in NUI Galway, beans were removed from pods and stored at −20 °C in plastic sample bags until further processing. Bean samples were then freeze-dried and a subsample of 20 beans (i.e. grains) were milled to a fine powder using a coffee grinder (Delonghi, KG49). Samples were vacuum-packed until ICP-MS analysis in Ionomics Lab, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, Scotland.</p>
