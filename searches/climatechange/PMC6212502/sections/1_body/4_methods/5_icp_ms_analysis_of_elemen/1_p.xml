<p id="Par37" class="p">Briefly, bean powder of each sample was analysed in duplicate with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as follows: trace metal grade nitric acid was added to the samples. Samples were then spiked with an internal standard plus hydrogen peroxide and left overnight to pre-digest. Following exposure to 115 °C for 4 hours, digested samples were diluted with Milli-Q water. Aliquots were transferred to a 96-well plate for analysis. A detailed description of ICP-MS analysis is provided in the Supplementary Information.</p>
