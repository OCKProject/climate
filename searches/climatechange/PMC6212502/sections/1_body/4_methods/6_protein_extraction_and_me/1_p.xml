 </sup>, namely aqueous extraction (albumins) followed by saline extraction (globulins), followed by cell-lysis extraction (other, membrane-bound proteins). Microcentrifuge tubes (2 ml) were prepared with ten 1 mm glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich) inside. For aqueous extraction bean powder was suspended in distilled water (50 mg in 400 µl; 1:8), shaken in a tissue lyser (QIAGEN) at maximum speed for 30 seconds, followed by incubation at 4 °C for 30 min (samples were shaken every 10 minutes). The sample was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes. Next, the water-insoluble fraction was extracted from the sediment. The sample was treated as before, but 0.5 M NaCl solution was used instead of distilled water. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes. This should result in 75% of total protein extraction. To release all membrane-bound proteins from the sediment, the sample was treated as before but Lysis buffer (50 mM citric acid, pH 3.0, 1 M NaCl, 2% SDS, 0.5% Triton-X-100) was used instead of NaCl solution or distilled water. The supernatant was transferred to new tubes; this is expected to result in ≥91% of total protein extraction.
