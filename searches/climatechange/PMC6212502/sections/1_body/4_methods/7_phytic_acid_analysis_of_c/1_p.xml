 </sup>. We used the same milled samples as those for ICP-MS. In brief, 50 mg aliquots of powder were thoroughly mixed with 2 ml 2.4% HCl, incubated at room temperature (RT) for 1 hour followed by 3 min centrifugation at 13000 rpm (Thermo Scientific, Fresco17). 1.8 ml of supernatant was transferred into new 14 ml tubes and diluted with 8.2 ml Milli-Q water. To remove the inorganic phosphate, 10 ml diluted samples were applied to the 10 ml Poly-Prep Chromatography Columns (#7311550, Bio-Rad), pre-packed with 0.3 g of AG1-X4 resin, 100–200 mesh (AG 1-X4 Resin #1401341, Bio-Rad) and equilibrated with 0.7 M NaCl, followed by elution with 10 ml 0.1 M NaCl. Phytate was eluted from the columns with 0.7 M NaCl into 15 ml Falcon tubes. Each sample was analysed in triplicate to measure phytate with WADE reagent (0.03% FeCl3*6H2O and 0.3% sulfosalicylic acid in Milli-Q water, according to Latta
