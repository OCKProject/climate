<p id="Par20" class="p">In addition to yield reductions that will negatively impact on livelihoods, there is potential for climate stresses to also impact on the nutritional quality of crops. Such climate effects may frustrate biofortification efforts to breed new biofortified varieties of staple crops that have elevated levels of essential micronutrients

 </sup> genebank revealed an average Fe concentration of 55 ppm, within a concentration range of 34 and 89 ppm. The average Zn concentration was 35 ppm, within a concentration range of 21 and 54ppm. Notably, all 20 genotypes investigated in our study have similar Fe and Zn concentrations. The average Fe concentration among genotypes used in our study (i.e. 59ppm) is statistically similar to the average observed across the primary genepool (i.e. 55 ppm). Likewise the average Zn concentration among the genotypes in our study (i.e. 35 ppm) is identical to the average across the genepool (i.e.35 ppm) (Fig.
