 </sup>. Our EcoCrop climatic suitability analyses for common bean in South Eastern Africa to 2050 indicates that predicted increases in temperature and reductions in rainfall (precipitation) will result in common bean becoming unsuitable for cultivation across the vast majority of current bean growing regions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1D</xref>). Only in specific localised zones in northern Zimbabwe, southern and northern Tanzania, and northern Malawi, are increases in climatic suitability for bean cultivation projected. Relocation of bean cultivation to different areas beyond the current range of cultivation may be possible, but in this case careful consideration should be given to choosing varieties suited for the new area, including any change in photoperiod that occurs with changing latitude. Overall, our findings are consistent with those of previous studies where different models to EcoCrop have been used

 </sup>. Future climate conditions will be associated with elevated atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations, which may either exacerbate or alleviate the effects of increased temperature and reduced precipitation on common bean growing regions. While the EcoCrop model cannot process atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects, it is noteworthy that C3 plants (of which common bean is one) have been shown experimentally to respond to drought by reducing photosynthesis, an effect which is not removed upon doubling CO

 </sup>. We conclude that, in the absence of implementation of significant adaptation strategies to maintain yields of common bean in southeastern Africa, it can be expected that yields of common bean will dramatically decline across the region in the period to 2050. The adaptation strategies that will be necessary to implement at scale may be incremental (e.g. breeding new bean varieties or using agronomic practices such as irrigation) or transformational (e.g. involving changing to a different protein or high-value crop species, or finding an alternative livelihood that is more climate-resilient)
