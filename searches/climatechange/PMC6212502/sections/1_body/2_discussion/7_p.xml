<p id="Par23" class="p">In this study we have focused on the effect of phytic acid because of its major influence on iron bioavailability, especially in the case of consuming beans in a composite meal

 </sup>. However, we recognise that polyphenols are an additional class of anti-nutritionals that need to be considered in high-Fe bean biofortification efforts. For instance, studies in black beans have shown that total polyphenols inhibit iron uptake in Caco-2 cell assays

 </sup>. The overall inhibitory effect of polyphenols is combinatorial, whereby some polyphenols (catechin, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid, kaempferol, and kaempferol 3-glucoside) promote iron uptake while others (myricetin, myricetin 3-glucoside, quercetin, and quercetin 3-glucoside) inhibit iron uptake

 </sup>. Because of differential potency effects between polyphenols that inhibit or promote iron uptake, it is considered that the majority of the inhibitory polyphenol compounds would need to be removed from biofortified beansÂ in order to substantially reduce the inhibitory effect on iron uptake
