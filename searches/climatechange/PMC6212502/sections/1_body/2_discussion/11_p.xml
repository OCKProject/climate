<p id="Par27" class="p">Our study indicates that ongoing efforts to develop biofortified bean varieties will need to not only develop heat- and drought-tolerant beans, but will also need to ensure that such varieties also maintain elevated iron and zinc levels, and low levels of antinutritional compounds (e.g. phytic acid, lead and specific inhibitory polyphenols) under drought or other environmental stresses. To avoid unintended consequences, our results highlight that it is critically important that biofortified crop varieties (including under abiotic stresses) do not accumulate anti-nutritionals (e.g. phytic acid, lead, arsenic, polyphenols)

 </sup>. Overall, our results demonstrate that there will be a reduction in the nutritional quality of a typical bean serving, if the common bean varieties have been cultivated under the levels of drought stress predicted for southeastern Africa to 2050 and beyond.
