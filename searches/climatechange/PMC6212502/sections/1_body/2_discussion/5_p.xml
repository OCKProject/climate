<p id="Par21" class="p">While there has been a previous attempt to determine the effect of water-limiting conditions on Fe and Zn levels in common bean, using a limited number of genotypes under irrigated conditions, further studies are required to determine impacts on nutritional availability under drought in key bean growing regions

 </sup>. In our study we have modeled the negative impacts of climate change on common bean production in southeastern Africa, which has revealed that reduced precipitation by 2050 will be the main limiting factor for bean cultivation. Furthermore, we conducted a multi-year field trial at a climate analogue site which experiences weather conditions similar to that predicted for Malawi in the year 2095. Our results are the first to demonstrate that the level of a key nutrient (i.e. iron) in common beans under climate change induced drought stress will significantly decline.
