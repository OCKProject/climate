<p id="Par25" class="p">The underlying physiological basis for the increases of antinutritional compounds such as phytic acid and lead under drought stress are unclear. In tropical soils, such as laterites, it has been shown that sorption values for Pb
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> are greater than those of other bivalent cations

 </sup>. The development of deeper rooting systems in arid soils could potentially lead to greater contact with Pb
 <sup class="sup">2+</sup> cations adsorbed within the soil. Alternatively, the observed increase could be a secondary effect of greater investment in active cation uptake when the soluble fraction of nutrient cations is insufficient to meet plant needs, reminiscent of the increased uptake of Al
 <sup class="sup">3+</sup> cations that can beÂ observed in calcicole plants under acidic conditions. However, we cannot exclude other impacts of drought and heat on root physiology
