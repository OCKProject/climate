In addition to drought-induced reductions in the levels of iron, our results demonstrate that drought-stressed common bean varieties also display increases in the levels of the antinutritional compounds phytic acid and lead. While we did not measure the levels of polyphenols, polyphenol levels can increase in plants in response to drought-stress
