<p id="Par11" class="p">To determine whether the reduction in yield of the common bean varieties under drought-stress conditions at the climate analogue trial site was more influenced by genotype (variety) or weather conditions (temperature, precipitation), an F-test was performed. This revealed that the variation in yield observed at the trial site is influenced more by weather conditions than genotype (Supplementary Results File). To determine whether there are any statistically significant differences between the varieties under drought stress conditions, a one-way ANOVA was performed, which showed no significant yield difference between the bean genotypes (Supplementary Results File). Similarly, no significant yield differences were identified between the bean genotypes under rainfed conditions (Supplementary Results File). Overall, for all bean varieties that were field trialed at the Malawi climate analogue site, the common bean grain yield decreased by an average of 43% under drought-stress conditions, which is significantly lower (two-tailed independent samples t-test,
