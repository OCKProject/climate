<p id="Par10" class="p">All twenty bean varieties were field trialed under both rainfed conditions and drought-stress conditions that are representative of conditions predicted by EcoCrop modeling to occur by 2050 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). This corresponded to four field trial seasons in total, i.e. two trials under rainfed conditions and two under drought-stress conditions. To ensure seasons could be reliably and reproducibly grouped according to “rainfed” and “drought-stress” conditions, 
 <italic class="italic">k</italic>-means cluster analysis was performed on recorded weather data for the field trial site. The identified clusters were analysed using discriminant analysis for the goodness of fit of the model, and t-statistics were applied to verify the predicted

These analyses confirmed that our drought-stress field trial conditions can be considered as a climate analogue site for bean growing seasonal weather conditions in the year 2095 in Malawi, under RCP 8.5. Average temperatures during our drought field trials were 22 °C with extremes of 35 °C, closely resembling the predicted average temperatures for the bean growing season (March, April and May) of 24 °C and extremes of 32 °C in the year 2095. Likewise, the average rainfall during the bean grain filling period in 2015 was 54 mm, similar to the projected average rainfall of 58 mm (Fig.
