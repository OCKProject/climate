<p id="Par9" class="p">To determine the impacts of future drought scenarios by 2050 on the yields of common bean, we conducted a field trial in western Malawi of 20 common bean varieties over two growing seasons. The bean varieties used consisted of varieties commonly cultivated by smallholder farmers and also bean lines developed by the CIAT and PABRA bean breeding programs under consideration for entry into the national varietal registration and official release process. They comprise a range of different market classes (i.e. quality types) including black, red, kidney, mottled red, brown, light brown and white beans, both smaller and larger sized seed varieties. These varieties were chosen to reflect the reality of (a) what bean varieties are actually available to smallholder farmers in Malawi and (b) what bean varieties are in the regulatory pipeline in Malawi that may become accessible to smallholders within the next decade, taking account of the time-lag expected for national varietal registration, certification processes and bulking up of seed by suppliers. The suitability of the field trial site area in western Malawi for common bean cultivation is projected to fall below current suitability levels by 2050, primarily due to decreased precipitation (Fig.Â
