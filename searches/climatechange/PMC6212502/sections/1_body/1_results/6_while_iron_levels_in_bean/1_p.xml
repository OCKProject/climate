 </sup>. To determine the changes in levels of dietary micronutrients between rainfed and drought-stress conditions of each common bean variety, we used inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure the relative concentrations of twenty-two elements (B, Na, Mg, P, S, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Cd and Pb), which included the important dietary micronutrients iron and zinc, and also antinutritional compounds such as lead (Table
