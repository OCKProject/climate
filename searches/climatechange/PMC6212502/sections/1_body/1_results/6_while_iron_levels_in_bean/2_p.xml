<p id="Par13" class="p">As seen for yield, the variations in iron, zinc, lead, protein and phytic acid under drought-stress conditions at the field site are more influenced by weather conditions than genotype (variety) (Supplementary Results File). To further investigate the lack of variation among genotypes for iron, zinc, lead, protein and phytic acid, a one-way ANOVA was performed. When we compared across genotypes under rainfed conditions we found no significant difference between genotypes for iron, zinc, lead, protein and phytic acid content. Similarly, when we compared across genotypes under drought conditions we found no significant difference between genotypes for iron, lead, protein and phytic acid content. Under drought-stress conditions, one variety shows significantly higher (

We also compared our results for concentrations of Zn and Fe for the twenty varieties tested under rainfed or drought conditions with those recorded for the 1000 accessions in the CIAT cultivated common bean core collection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>) and find them to be representative of the range of Fe levels, and representative (or slightly enriched) for Zn. The responses of Fe and Zn in our tested varieties are therefore likely to be similar to those of other common bean genotypes.
