<p id="Par14" class="p">Overall, across all of the twenty bean varieties analysed, the levels of iron are significantly reduced under drought stress (two-tailed independent samples t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), from an average concentration of 59 ppm in beans from rainfed plants to 54 ppm from drought-stressed plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2A</xref>). Conversely, the average concentration of zinc significantly increases under drought stress (two-tailed independent samples t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.05), from 35 ppm in beans from rainfed plants to 39 ppm from drought-stressed plants, (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2B</xref>). We identify a significant increase (two-tailed independent samples t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in lead levels in the bean grains under drought-stress conditions, from an average concentration of 0.05 ppm to 0.22 ppm, representing a fourfold increase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2C</xref>). This exceeds the maximum level permissible (0.1 ppm) for pulses as defined by the Codex Alimentarius

 </sup>. The average total protein concentration also significantly increases under drought stress (two-tailed independent samples t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) from 326 mg/g of dry weight in beans from rainfed plants to 371 mg/g of dry weight in beans from drought-stressed plants (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2D</xref>). Similarly, there was a significant increase (two-tailed independent samples t-test, 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001) in phytic acid levels under drought stress, from an average level of 0.96% under rainfed conditions to 1.16% under drought stress (Fig.
