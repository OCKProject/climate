<p id="Par15" class="p">To further investigate the link between weather conditions during the grain filling period and common bean growth, multiple linear regression analysis was performed. As the differences in rainfall between the rainfed seasons and the drought-stress seasons were also accompanied by differences in air temperature (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>), the impact of temperature was included as well as rainfall. Over 50% of the variation in yield and iron could be explained by changes in temperature and rainfall between flowering date and harvest. Approx. 40% of the variation in lead could be explained by changes in temperature that occurred between flowering date and harvest, while rainfall that occurred during this time window did not improve the model. Approx. 30% of the variation in protein levels could be explained by changes in temperature and rainfall between flowering date and harvest. Finally, weather conditions during the grain filling period only explained a small part of the variation in zinc (4.0%) or phytic acid (17%), suggesting that other factors not included in the model influence zinc and phytic acid levels in the grain (Supplementary Results File).
