 </sup>. To determine the supply of nutritional and anti-nutritional compounds on a per meal basis, we calculated the quantity of each dietary compound that each common bean variety would deliver per serving (50 g) under present day (rainfed) and future climate (drought-stress) scenarios (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). This highlights that while future bean servings under climate change may become more zinc-rich, they will contain less iron and more undesirable anti-nutritionals (lead and phytic acid). Our results indicate that some varieties (NUA 59, NUA 674) may display promise for drought-proofing dietary supplies from beans under predicted future climate-change scenarios.
