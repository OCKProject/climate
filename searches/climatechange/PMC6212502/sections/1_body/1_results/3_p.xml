 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>). The unshaded areas within the countries analysed (Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe) are considered unsuitable for bean cultivation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>). Currently, suitable areas for bean cultivation extend across most of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, western Malawi, and northern Mozambique (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1A</xref>). Our simulated historical climatic suitability for common bean cultivation agrees well with the observed distribution of bean cultivation in Africa

 </sup>. Our EcoCrop modelling of future climate impacts on bean cultivation suitability indicates that a significant proportion of the currently suitable areas will become unsuitable for common bean cultivation by 2050 (red areas in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>), particularly in southern Zambia, eastern Zimbabwe, and central Tanzania. In these areas, unless appropriate climate adaptation actions (e.g. climate smart agriculture (CSA) breeding and agronomy options such as new varieties or irrigation) are put in place, it will no longer be possible to grow common beans.
