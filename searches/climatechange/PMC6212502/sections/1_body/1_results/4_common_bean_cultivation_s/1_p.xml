<p id="Par8" class="p">Our results further indicate that a reduction in the temperature-related suitability resulting from increased heat stress by 2050 is predicted as the main cause (ΔT &lt; ΔP) for the overall reduction in climatic suitability of bean growing areas in north western Tanzania, southern Zambia, and western Zimbabwe (dark red shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>). Conversely, reductions in precipitation-related suitability by 2050 were found to be the major cause (ΔP &lt; ΔT) of climatic suitability change reductions in western Malawi, northern Zambia, eastern Tanzania, and southern Zimbabwe (orange shading in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1C</xref>). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1D</xref> demonstrates where future bean cultivation suitability by 2050 will be predominantly limited by temperature (red), precipitation (blue) or both temperature and precipitation (yellow).
