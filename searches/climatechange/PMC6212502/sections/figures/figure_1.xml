   <bold class="bold">E</bold>) Percentage of children, under the age of 5, who are underweight (data from CIESIN), for the period 1990–2002. Red (reduced suitability), blue (increased suitability), and beige (no change in suitability) colours are used in (
   <bold class="bold">C</bold>) to separate directions of change. In red areas, shades of red are used to differentiate areas where suitability reductions are due to temperature changes (ΔT &lt; ΔP), from those where suitability reductions are due to precipitation changes (ΔP &lt; ΔT) or where temperature- and precipitation- suitability reductions are equal (ΔP = ΔT). In blue areas, shades of blue are used to differentiate areas where suitability increases are primarily driven by precipitation (ΔP &gt; ΔT), temperature (ΔT &gt; ΔP), or equally driven by both (ΔP = ΔT).
