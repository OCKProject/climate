<p class="p">Very few vulnerability assessments on climate change and malaria in East Africa are in published literature. A conceptual and methodological framework for modelling of social vulnerability for the East African region in a spatially explicit manner and independent of current disease prevalence, in order to provide options for targeted interventions was presented by Kienberger and Hagenlocher [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Risk and vulnerability was framed within the recent Inter Governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) definition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] in a dynamic and holistic manner and a number of related factors influencing disease risk were considered. Analysis and results established links to risk governance, climate change adaptation and relevant intervention strategies to several water-related vector borne diseases, including malaria. In a related study, Bizimana et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] applied a composite indicator approach to assess social vulnerability to malaria transmission in Rwanda at a district level. An adapted vulnerability assessment framework [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] was used to identify indicators of different components of vulnerability in terms of generic susceptibility (i.e., lacking capacity to anticipate) and biological susceptibility (i.e., lacking capacity to cope or recover). Both studies mapped the main indicators of social vulnerability to malaria at district [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">41</xref>] and East African regional [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] levels. While both of these approaches provide useful tools for decision-making, only social vulnerability to malaria was considered. Also, there is an assumption of homogeneity of the population and landscape, which suggests uniformity of indicators while in reality there are differences in population and factors such as topography that will have an impact on the weight of indicators. Both papers acknowledge these limitations by suggesting that interventions should take into account the relevance of specific indicators of malaria vulnerability for different regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>] and that future research should focus on an integrated vulnerability assessment that combines both environmental and social drivers [
