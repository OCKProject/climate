<p class="p">Warming over the African continent is faster than the global average [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. Projections for the next century show that most areas of the continent will exceed the 2 °C threshold by the last two decades of this century under medium scenarios and that under high scenarios this will happen by mid-century and reach between 3 and 6 °C by the end of the century [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]. The malaria mosquito and parasite are both sensitive to changes in climate and climate variability and the projected rising temperatures and changes in rainfall patterns will create favourable conditions for mosquito breeding in many areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" class="xref">4</xref>]. In East Africa, climate scenarios suggest longer malaria transmission seasons and geographic expansion of the disease into highland areas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>]. According to published literature, the earliest malaria-climate connection in the East African highlands was identified in the 1980s when there was a series of malaria epidemics connected to increases and anomalies in mean monthly maximum temperatures and increase in rainfall in the highlands [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>]. Since then, the frequency and size of epidemics increased with serious outbreaks in 1995, 1998 and 2002, corresponding to climate variations such as a significant increase (≥3 °C) in mean temperatures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>], high rainfall [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>], drought and El Nino events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>]. Concurrently, increasing human population and intensified agricultural activities in the highlands has led to land use changes that in turn have enhanced vector production. At local scales, these changes in land cover, along with differences in topography, result in micro-climatic variability, raise surface temperatures by up to 2 °C, may have more of an impact on malaria transmission than climate change alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>] and therefore should be included in vulnerability and risk assessments.
