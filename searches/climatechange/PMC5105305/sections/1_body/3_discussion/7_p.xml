<p class="p">While BBN models have been widely applied in a range of natural resource management and decision support contexts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" class="xref">56</xref>], there has been limited application of the same in climate change and public health assessments. Combining information from a range of quantitative and qualitative sources and integrating them using BBNs should result in a more robust model, informed by community needs and capabilities, leading to further knowledge generation and identification of targeted response strategies for decision-making and policy.
