<p class="p">The systems conceptual model, represented by the influence diagram, complemented with existing risk and vulnerability assessment frameworks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>] was used to develop an integrated assessment framework that considers both biophysical and social influences on malaria transmission. Multiple definitions exist for vulnerability, but for the development of our framework the definition of vulnerability in the context of vector-borne diseases as defined by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] as “a combination of a change in exposure of humans to pathogens with environmental change and the sensitivity of the population to that change” was adopted. Also, the [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">21</xref>] definition of adaptive capacity as consisting of “…technologies, cultural tools and the public health infrastructure and resources that are available to implement appropriate management responses” was adopted. These definitions are consistent with those of IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, which defines vulnerability to disease and injury due to climate variability and climate change as “the propensity or predisposition to be adversely affected” dependent on generic (education, income, health status and responsiveness of government) and biological susceptibility (age, gender and immune status) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52" class="xref">52</xref>]. Finally, the risk of impacts from climate change was understood as “resulting from the overlap of hazards from the physical climate and the vulnerability and exposure of people, ecosystems, and assets” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>].
