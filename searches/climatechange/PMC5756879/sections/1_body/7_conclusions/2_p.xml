<p class="p">Current results indicate a reduction in climatic suitability for OP production worldwide which are gradual by 2030, and more pronounced by 2100. These imply that palm oil production will be severely affected by CC, with obvious implications for the economies of Indonesia and Malaysia and for the international manufacture of palm oil products. The growth of OP might become optimal in currently subtropical regions as a consequence of the general movement of crops to the Poles, although biodiversity and ecological function loss require careful consideration in these novel regions. There is a general consensus that as CC progresses the climate suitability for growing crops will move toward the Poles. For example, as the tropics becomes too hot for the growth of crops, suitable climate will progress toward the subtropics further north and south (Paterson etÂ al.,

Ultimately, the optimal overall strategy to reduce the effect of CC on OP growth is to reduce CC in general and a way forward with considerable hope are the measures in the Paris treaty (

This represents an agreement to keep CC controlled which requires cooperation internationally.
