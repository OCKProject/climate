<p class="p">Biodiversity loss by developing novel plantations will inhibit further expansion in Latin America and Africa. OP expansion in novel biodiversity‚Äêrich regions such West Africa and Latin America that lead to further major deforestation in those regions will simply exacerbate the environmental problem experienced in SE Asia and requires avoiding. Government action in particular is needed to ensure environmental issue receives as much weight as economic. CC appears inevitable and even more government action will be required to reduce these alterations. CC will have a profoundly negative effect on biodiversity and ecosystem function as is generally well known. However, this present review does not concern the effects of CC generally but is specific to OP.</p>
