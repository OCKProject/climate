<p class="p">Large‐scale oil palm (OP) cultivation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33610-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) has transformed tropical regions, people's lives, and palm oil companies’ profits. High output, easy establishment, and low costs make the crop very profitable and the most efficient oil crop economically (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Palm oil use is high and growing rapidly which is driven by economic development in countries such as India and China. Very large oil yields are obtained, and the high adaptability of OP is valuable especially in the climate change (CC) context. Indeed, palm oil is a huge global industry, worth over USD 50 billion annually (Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Most crude palm oil is used in food and biodiesel production, while palm kernel oil is employed in detergents, cosmetics, plastics, and chemicals. Sustainable OP involves challenges (Rival, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), and, for example, development on peatlands appears a myth (Evers, Yule, &amp; Padfield,
