<p class="p">Climate change will have a profoundly negative effect on cultivation of OP, especially by 2100 (Paterson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). On the other hand, some ecological functions of OP plantations compared to forests have potentially irreversible global impacts such as reduction in gas and climate regulation (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The most serious impacts occur when forest is cleared to establish plantations immediately after removal, and especially on peat soils. The reduced ability to cultivate OP may have benefits in ameliorating CC, as, for example, less deforestation may occur because of the reduced ability to grow OP.
