<p class="p">Palm oil is incorporated into many commodities and is produced, stored, processed, packaged, transported, and prepared before becoming the desired commodity. These processes release GHG. Nevertheless, only the effect on cultivation of OP is considered in this present review (Paterson, Kumar, Shabani, &amp; Lima, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>; Paterson, Kumar, Taylor, &amp; Lima, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Indonesia and Malaysia produce ca. 83% of palm oil contributing significantly to their economies. Malaysia's palm oil exports add 45% to the world's edible oil needs (Shanmuganathan, Narayanan, &amp; Mohamed, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The concentration of such a high proportion of palm cultivation in Malaysia/Indonesia is somewhat undesirable as cultivation in other countries combats threats from climate and locally adapted pests and pathogens. Further expansion into West Africa and Latin America creates a more secure production system in the longer term in the opinion of Murphy (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) and a doubling of palm oil production in the next decades is considered feasible from this expansion. However, these estimations of production do not take into account CC (Paterson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) which undermines these assessments, nor do they consider other negative consequences of OP development such as biodiversity loss (Fitzherbert et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) and most ecosystem functions (Dislich et al.,
