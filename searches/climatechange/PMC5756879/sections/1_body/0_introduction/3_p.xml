<p class="p">Climate change and OP discussions herein are considered as follows: (1) the effect of CC on OP cultivation, and (2) vice versa. This dual nature is particularly interesting. Most scientific literature supports the occurrence of CC caused largely by human industry. OP plantations have reduced ecosystem functioning generally compared to forests (the predominant ecosystem replaced by OP) (Dislich etÂ al.,
