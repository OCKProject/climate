<p class="p">The effects of soil management practices including (1) empty fruit bunch (EFB) application, (2) palm frond application and chemical fertilization improving soil fauna (worms, beetles, and ants) feeding activity, and (3) better soil chemical properties show considerable promise. EFB greatly enhanced soil fauna feeding activity and is associated with increased concentrations of base cations and soil moisture. The elevated biological activity has high potential to assist ecosystem functions such as litter decomposition, nutrient cycling, organic carbon stabilization, and ultimately OP productivity. These are factors that would also be useful in ameliorating CC and enhancing OP growth under suboptimal conditions. The application of crop residue in OP ecosystems may have a role in (1) enhancing soil resilience to CC effects, such as drought and flooding, and (2) ameliorating disturbances associated with second and third replanting cycles in South‐East Asia (Tao et al.,
