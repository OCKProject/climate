<p class="p">Negative microclimatic effects associated with clear‐cutting senescent plantations can be mitigated by sequential replanting that leaves a range of palm ages and maintains canopy cover (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The sustainability of OP production will depend in part on using cover crops, especially under suboptimal conditions. Leguminous cover crops are grown to (1) coexist with OP following jungle clearing and planting/replanting, (2) provide complete cover to an otherwise bare soil, and (3) protect from erosion. Leguminous cover crops also perform multiple functions such as reducing soil water evaporation, reducing runoff losses, improving/maintaining soil fertility, and recycling of nutrients (Samedani et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Leguminous crops benefit subsequent crops by (1) the addition of N, (2) disease and weed control, and (3) improved soil water‐holding capacity. These promise reduced environmental pollution and improved crop yields. Legumes may reduce C and N losses from OP systems and increase soil C sequestration. Some examples for OP are as follows: Pigeon pea, Calopo, butterfly pea, white tephrosia, and Brazilian stylo some of which are already in use in SE Asia (Samedani et al.,
