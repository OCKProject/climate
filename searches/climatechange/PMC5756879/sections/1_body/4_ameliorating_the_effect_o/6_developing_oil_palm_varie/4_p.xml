<p class="p">Nevertheless, it will be difficult to develop OP resistant to CC partly because it is not known precisely how climate will change. Paterson et al. (

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This is supportive to the hypothesis that CC will cause more disease. The Parasites lost phenomena should be considered where crops planted in new regions may have fewer pests and diseases (Paterson et al.,
