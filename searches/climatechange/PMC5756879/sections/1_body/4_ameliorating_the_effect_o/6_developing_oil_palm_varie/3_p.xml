 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>) suggested developing OP with high lignin content as a way of combating disease by the white rot fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma</italic>, thereby making OP more resistant to CC, as disease is considered to increase with CC (Paterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; and above). However, Murphy (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) mentions a possible way of increasing palm oil yield is to channel more C toward lipid biosynthesis, and less toward other “less valuable” end products such as lignin. The majority of C assimilated via photosynthesis produces a lignified trunk that has relatively little economic value (Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). This is deceptive as lignin protects from disease as mentioned, especially when it is the white rot fungus 
 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma</italic> (Paterson, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Selecting for complete resistance, rather than tolerance to diseases, leads to high selection pressures for new variants of the pest/pathogen that can overcome the resistance in the crop. Sequencing of the OP and disease genomes may assist (1) greatly in the identification of genes related to virulence and (2) breeders to develop more tolerant varieties of OP, and/or (3) developing lower virulence strains of 
 <italic class="italic">Ganoderma</italic> to outcompete high‐virulence strains (Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Zainal et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) recommend the development of OP varieties tolerant to high temperatures and which utilize low amounts of water. Also, understanding how CC affects (1) chemical and physical processes in soils, (2) nutrient availability, and (3) changed availability of nutrients will influence OP breeding programs (Rival, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).
