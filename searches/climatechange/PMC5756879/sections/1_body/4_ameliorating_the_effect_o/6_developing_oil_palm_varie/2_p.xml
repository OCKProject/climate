<p class="p">Breeding OP for CC requires multidisciplinary and collaborative research (Rival, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The identification of OP genetic variation in response to stress is required, implying the exploration of resources provided by natural variation, germplasm collections, selected genitors from breeding programs, and material of interest collected from smallholders. Hence, one can immediately anticipate how complicated, lengthy, and expensive this process may be.
