 <xref rid="ece33610-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref> demonstrates the averages of four data sets (Paterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) illustrating trends in the change of suitable climate more clearly. The areas for HSC are in factors of 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, whereas those for the other area types are, at most, at a factor of 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup>. There is a slight increase, and medium, and large decreases in HSC in 2030, 2070, and 2100, respectively. These changes are reflected in corresponding changes in unsuitable, marginal, and suitable climates. The most significant figure is the large decrease in HSC by 2100 of 7.9 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (56%). Concomitant increases of 4.70 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (7778%) and 5.25 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (6738%) in regions with marginal and suitable climate, respectively, were determined and unsuitable climate regions decreased by 2.03 × 10
 <sup class="sup">5</sup> km
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> (39%). The increase in marginal and suitable regions was derived from the HSC regions largely and the unsuitable regions to a lesser degree. Hence, there may be novel areas for OP development even under CC, although in general, the climate suitability 
 <italic class="italic">per se</italic> will be reduced, especially from the dominant HSC currently experienced. The marginal climates may not be suitable for OP resulting in low yields and disease (see also below).
