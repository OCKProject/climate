<p class="p">Cultivation at higher altitudes and/or lower and higher latitudes may be possible beyond the lowland tropics as CC progresses (Paterson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) predicted an increase in highly suitable climate (HSC) for growing OP by 2030 in Indonesia and Malaysia largely in mountainous regions of Sumatra, Sarawak, Borneo, and Sulawesi. These areas had increasingly HSC by 2070 and 2100 being almost the only more suitable regions amidst the general decrease. There may other factors which do not permit OP growth, for example, lack of suitable soil, which require further investigation. The other factors mitigating against employing this novel cultivation area may include decreased biodiversity and ecological function (see above).
