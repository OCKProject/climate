<p class="p">Paraguay will have high increases in HSC and suitable climate by 2050 which is maintained until 2100, despite not being an important OP grower currently, whereas Madagascar will have increases in HSC during these periods (Paterson etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Argentina, Southern Brazil, South Africa, Manamer, Bangladesh, and southern China had increases in HSC by 2100, but which was not observed in 2050. Hence, it may be possible to expand OP cultivation in these countries and regions, although biodiversity and ecological function loss should play major parts in deciding the feasibility of using these novel areas. Indonesia, Malaysia, and Columbia have increases in merely suitable climate and marginal climate despite decreases in HSC, and so may be able to continue with cultivating OP, although with greater climate stress. Thailand, Brazil, and Nigeria are considered to change directly to unsuitable climate from HSC and so have less scope for adaption. Brazil has not fully developed its current potential to produce palm oil and so may not be as affected by the CC problem, although expansion of the crop appears limited by CC as discussed herein.
