<p class="p">Nevertheless, there is scope for growing OP in the reduced or novel HSC regions and the newly suitable climate regions despite CC, although the marginal climate areas are unlikely to support OP. A caveat being potential biodiversity and ecological function loss if novel areas are converted from, for example, forest. A premium will be placed on being able to grow OP in suboptimal conditions, for example, by breeding for new varieties (Rival, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and/or ensuring that conditions are as suitable as possible for growth of the palms as discussed herein. Detailed descriptions of where the climate becomes more apt for OP are provided in Paterson etÂ al. (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>), which are often in countries which do not grow large amounts of OP currently. In the medium and long term, a considerable geographical extension of OP cultivation in a broad zone across the tropics of Africa, Asia, and the Americas (Murphy, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) may not be possible, although there may be small increases in some currently suboptimal regions, when considering ability to grow OP only.
