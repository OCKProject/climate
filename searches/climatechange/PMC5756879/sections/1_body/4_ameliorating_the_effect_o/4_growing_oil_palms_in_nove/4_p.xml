HSC decreased by 100% in Indonesia, whereas unsuitable, marginal, and suitable increased by 36%, 98%, and 96%, respectively, by 2100. In Malaysia, HSC decreased by 271%, whereas marginal and suitable increased each by 100%. Unsuitable climate decreased by 70%. Overall, there is a general decrease in HSC to less suitable climate which will have a detrimental effect on yields, including a probable increase in diseases from additional climate stress (Paterson et al.,
