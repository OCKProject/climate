<p class="p">The concentration of ca. 85% of OP cultivation in Malaysia/Indonesia is detrimental to combating CC. More dispersed cultivation outside these countries could ameliorate threats from CC as a wider range of climates would be encountered, some of which may be more suitable for OP. The expansion into West Africa and South/Central America underway was intended to create a more secure production system in the longer term, coupled with the reduced available land in Malaysia and Indonesia (Murphy,

The increase in biodiversity loss and decreases in ecological functions previously mentioned would also mitigate against expansion into novel areas.
