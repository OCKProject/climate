<p class="p">Changing forest to OP plantations gives high reductions in gas and climate regulation function (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). OP plantations produce more GHG and volatile organic compounds (VOC), a precursor to tropospheric ozone. The carbon sequestered by OP does compensate for the GHG emitted from land‐clearing fires and land and plantation establishment. VOC, GHG, and aerosol particles emissions during fire periods result in direct and indirect changes of solar irradiation. OP plantations compared to forest leads to higher air and soil temperature and lower air humidity microclimates (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Indonesia has substantially expanded OP plantations and smallholder agriculture, reducing drastically the area of primary forest, especially in Sumatra, which has the highest primary rainforest cover loss in the country. Forest cover in Riau and Jambi declined from 93% to 38% between 1977 and 2009 which changed microclimatic conditions because forests regulated the climate. Expansion of OP plantations leads to warming of the land surface and increases in air temperature from CC as observed in Sumatra (Sabajo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). OP foliage cover is lower, more open, and simpler than tropical rainforest foliage cover: Clearing land for OP plantations and planting OP results in higher surface temperatures (Ramdani, Moffiet, &amp; Hino, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The warming results from reduced evaporative cooling as the main determinant of regulating the surface temperature. Warming induced by land cover change (LCC) exceeded the global warming effect: understanding this effect may support (1) conservation of existing forest policies, (2) planning and expansion of the OP plantations, and (3) afforestation measures. OP may have adapted to the increased temperature, although the increase in land temperature will exacerbate CC (Sabajo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). The increase in LCC, which is seldom considered, is a third factor contributing to CC in addition to deforestation and conversion of peat.
