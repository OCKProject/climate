<p class="p">CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> is the primary molecule contributing to the GHG from OP plantations and methane (CH
 <sub class="sub">4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) are modest in comparison, although with greater effect per molecule. Land‐clearing fires lead to large releases of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from vegetation and soil, particularly so on peat. Fires can indirectly increase emissions by exposing organic‐rich soil layers to rapid decomposition exacerbated by ash increasing peat decomposition. Large amounts of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are released during drainage of peat soil to establish plantations by oxidization and decomposition: dissolved organic matter is flushed out of peat soils when they are drained, which then decomposes and releases additional CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Dislich et al.,
