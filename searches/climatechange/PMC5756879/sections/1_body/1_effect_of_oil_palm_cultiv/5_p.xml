<p class="p">Oil palm plantations assimilate CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> from the atmosphere acting as a carbon sink, as does any vegetation. Interestingly, OP plantations assimilate more CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and produce more biomass than forests due to very high fruit production, often used erroneously as an argument in favor of OP. This higher rate of C uptake does not compensate for that released when forests are cleared, as forests have more aboveground and belowground biomass than OP plantations unless very long timescales are considered. The timescales are hundreds of years (Kotowska, Leuschner, &amp; Triadiati, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0018" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), well beyond the maximum time frame of ca. 80 years considered in Paterson et al. (

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) in terms of the effect of CC on suitable climate for OP growth for example. Furthermore, OP plantations release more N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O into the atmosphere than forests, mainly from fertilizer use: Fires add black carbon, which increase global warming. OP plantations have a direct effect on local microclimates by having lower, less dense canopies and a lower leaf area index than forests (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Peatland deforestation for OP cultivation in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, increases GHG emissions greatly (Barcelos et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>; Carlson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, OP plantations managed in a manner harmless to the environment may be sustainable production systems (Sheil et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Overall, the biological and managerial tools to surmount many challenges exist but need better support (Murphy,
