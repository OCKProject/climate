CC effects on OP phenology and fruit production have profound implications at local and international levels. Shanmuganathan et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0037" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) examined the recent CC effects on OP yield between 2007 and 2011. El Niño and La Niña climate events on local climate and OP production in Tumaco, Colombia, established that they had lagged and conflicting impacts on yields. El Niño was favorable, showing a maximum correlation with production 2.6 years after the event. Meanwhile, La Niña caused severe droughts, with the highest reduced yield in 2002. OP are susceptible to drought (Dislich et al.,
