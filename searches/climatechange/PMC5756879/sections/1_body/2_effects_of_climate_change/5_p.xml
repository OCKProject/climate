<p class="p">High temperatures and heavy rains were favorable to palm oil production in the western coast of Sabah, Malaysia, with a lag period of 3 and 4 months, respectively. Flooding and severe drought were unfavorable in some cases. The higher precipitation/floods of the La Niña decreased the production and quality of crude palm oil (CPO) attributed to affecting the fruit ripening stage and reflected in the yield in subsequent months. CC variability and its effects on OP yield in East and West Malaysia revealed correlations between climate variations, OP tree phenology, and yield. Average monthly temperature 8 months prior to harvest of ≥27.83°C led to low yield across Malaysia (Shanmuganathan et al.,

Furthermore, OP yields are projected to decrease by 30% should temperature increase 2°C above optimum and rainfall decreases by 10% in Malaysia. Reduction in CPO production caused by CC in southern Malaysia was 26.3% and drought in SE Asia caused declines of 10%–30% in palm oil production. A temperature variation of 0.6–1.4°C and ±15% rainfall variation led to a positive change in earnings for PO of up to $2,453 per year, while earnings were reduced to $1,181 per year with ±32% rainfall fluctuation and moderate temperature fluctuation. The countries which cultivate OP will face increasing uncertainty in the future (Paterson et al.,
