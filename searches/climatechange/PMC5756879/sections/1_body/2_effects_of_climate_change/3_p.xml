<p class="p">Palm oil production has already declined because of the direct and indirect uncertainties of CC. Zainal, Shamsudin, Mohamed, and Adam (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) predicted that palm oil revenue would reduce by 341.29, 127.43, and 51.80 MYR/ha for Peninsula Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak, respectively, by 2029. Even greater losses are predicted by 2099 for Sabah and Sarawak (294.20 and 105.62 MYR/ha, respectively) although Peninsular Malaysia was similar. Increase in temperature and rainfall resulted in 41, 49, and 38 MYR/ha decrease for Peninsular Malaysia, Sabah, and Sarawak. These figures are without adaption and mitigation strategies being taken (Zainal et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and are to some extent confirmed by decreases in suitable climate for OP growth during similar periods (Paterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>).
