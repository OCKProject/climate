<p class="p">Finally, Corley and Tinker (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) state that OP suffering more disease from CC, as mentioned in Paterson, Sariah, and Lima (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), appears unjustified. However, the premise that stress conditions (Paterson et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) caused by CC is likely to increase OP disease is justified in the current authors’ opinion. Furthermore, Rival (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) implies that, 
 <italic class="italic">inter alia</italic>, CC will increase diseases and pests of OP, hence corroborating the premise. Paterson et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) provide extensive information on crop disease decreases and increases linked to CC, although there is little published on the effect on OP disease of CC per se: This effect on disease will become more apparent in the future.
