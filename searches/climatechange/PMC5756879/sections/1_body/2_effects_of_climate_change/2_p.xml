<p class="p">There is an increasing awareness of the negative effect of CC on the OP industry (MPOC,

CC will (1) reduce overall the current cultivated areas, (2) extend plantations to new areas, assuming issues such as biodiversity loss are overcome, and (3) challenge the capacity for adaptation by growers. The conditions of OP cultivation by abiotic (i.e., rainfall, temperatures, carbon dioxide, and soil salinity) and biotic (i.e., diseases, pests, pollinators, and associated crops) stresses will be affected detrimentally in most cases (Rival, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Tropical plants are often at the limits of growth, where small changes in climate can affect survival. In general, more crops and greater yields are projected to occur in regions that are cool (e.g., subtropical), while fewer crops and yields are projected to occur in regions that are hot (e.g., tropical) (Paterson et al.,
