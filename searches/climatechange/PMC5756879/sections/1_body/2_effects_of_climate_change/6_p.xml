<p class="p">Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Peru, and Columbia have an estimated 2.00, 0.78, 0.61, 0.46, and 0.42 million hectares, respectively, of forest identified as suitable for OP growth. However, these countries will experience large decreases in climate suitability (Paterson et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). OP plantations are limited to low elevation areas and are in direct conflict with tropical lowland forests, including those found within riverine floodplains subject to periodic flooding by rivers or streams. Consequently, unsuitable areas are principally linked to seasonal and/or tidal inundation events. Nevertheless, simplistic biophysical criteria are often used by governments and agencies for agricultural zoning for OP that includes slope, elevation, and soil types within suitable climatic zones which may fail to capture regionalized constraints. In 2011, 1.43 million hectares (19.3%) of Sabah's terrestrial extent was under OP which could increase to 2.1 million hectares by 2025 (Abram et al.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0027" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) indicate that the current highly suitable climate of Sabah for OP will not decrease until 2100 and so this does not contradict the just‐mentioned prediction for 2025. OP expansion will likely continue to target the eastern State floodplains areas that have very high yield potential. Much of the unproductive OP is related to flooding which is likely to increase with CC (Abram et al.,
