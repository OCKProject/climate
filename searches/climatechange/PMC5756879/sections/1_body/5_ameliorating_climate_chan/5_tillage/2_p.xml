<p class="p">Reduced tillage is another possibility for affecting CC, where reducing tillage with AMF provides the optimal conditions for OP. Low tillage in combination with AMF assists nutrient uptake, water relations, and protecting against pathogens and toxic stress (Naher, Othman, &amp; Panhwar, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), hence potentially ameliorating the effect of CC on OP growth. Also, low tillage will decrease the emission of GHG from OP plantations (Sakata etÂ al.,
