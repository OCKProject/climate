Significant waste is produced from crop residues such as (1) forest residues, (2) mill residues, (3) field crop residues, and (4) urban wastes in many agricultural and forestry production systems. Many of these can be used to produce biochar and applied to agricultural soil. Up to 12% of the total anthropogenic C emissions by land‐use change can be offset annually in soil if slash‐and‐burn is replaced by slash‐and‐char (Lehmann, Gaunt, &amp; Rondon,
