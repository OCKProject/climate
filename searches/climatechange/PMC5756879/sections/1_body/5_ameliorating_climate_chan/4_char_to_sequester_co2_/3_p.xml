<p class="p">New Terra Preta‐type sites could be the basis for sustainable OP including under CC, in, for example, Indonesia. This could combat desertification, sequester atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in the long term, and help to maintain biodiversity in tropical rainforests. Large‐scale generation and utilization of Terra Preta soils would decrease the pressure on primary forests that are being extensively cleared for OP growth, but with only limited fertility and sustainability and, hence, providing a limited time for cropping. This would mitigate land degradation and CC. However, the infertility of most tropical soils (and associated low population density) is what could have prevented clearance of tropical forests for agriculture in the first place. Increased fertility may increase the populations supported by shifting cultivation, thereby maintaining and increasing pressure on forests (Glaser,
