<p class="p">Optimizing the rhizosphere by the use of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) will also assist in reducing CC with generalized benefits to OP growth, by reducing the need for fertilizer for example (Sakata et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). In general, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbioses have beneficial effects on water transport to assist in overcoming drought conditions (Augé, Toler, &amp; Saxton, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), of relevance particularly to ameliorating the effect of CC. However, few published reports on the interaction of AMF and OP are available. The inoculation of OP seedlings resulted in a threefold growth enhancement compared to noninoculated plants after 570 days in natural soil substrate with no fertilizer addition. The inoculation of OP seedlings with AMF increased plant growth and nutrient uptake of OP and in particular P uptake was enhanced by 37%–44%. Application of AM, as single (

 <italic class="italic">Gigaspora</italic> sp.,

 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Reducing fertilizer production and use will cause decreased emissions that lead to CC, and the use of AM could ameliorate the effects of CC on OP.
