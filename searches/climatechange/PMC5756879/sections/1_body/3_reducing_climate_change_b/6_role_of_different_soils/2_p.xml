<p class="p">An option for OP planting, without threatening tropical rain forests, is the rehabilitation of anthropogenic grassland, created by human clearance of natural forest eons ago. There exist vast areas of anthropogenic grassland in Indonesia where much of the spread of OP plantations will take place. “Flexibility mechanisms” could act as an incentive for grassland rehabilitation. The biomass of tropical lowland forests, the forest type most frequently converted to OP growing, is usually higher than that of upland forest, reflecting the high soil fertility and favorable rainfall in areas suitable for OP production. C fixation in plantation biomass and soil organic matter results in the net removal of ca. 135 Mg CO

Conversely, emission from forest conversion exceeds the potential carbon fixation of OP plantings. Grassland rehabilitation may (1) preserve natural forest, (2) avoid emissions, and (3) generate additional revenue if the sequestered C becomes tradable (Germer &amp; Sauerborn,
