<p class="p">Reducing nitrogen fertilizer decreases nitrogen‐based emissions (Dislich et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). OP plantations release large quantities of nitrous oxide (N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) into the atmosphere linked to nitrogen (N) fertilizer use. More work is required on comparing effects of soil (see below) and N fertilizer on N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> emissions. Sakata et al. (
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) demonstrated that N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fluxes in OP plantations were significantly affected by the type of soil, but not always by fertilizer treatments: Simunjan sandy soil was lowest for N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O emissions, and Tatau peat soil was the highest. The data on N application and respiration rate are variable and require determinations for particular biomes (Zhong, Yan, &amp; Shangguan, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Increased flux of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> after N fertilizer application was observed occasionally and confirmed rapid emission enhancement in a matter of days following fertilizer application in tropical peatlands, hence potentially increasing CC. More work is required using different systems (Comeau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>).
