<p class="p">Plantation management measures can prevent or reduce losses of some ecosystem functions which will reduce CC. These include (1) avoiding illegal land clearing by fire, (2) avoiding draining of peat, and (3) using cover crops, mulch, and compost (Dislich etÂ al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0010" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). Reducing GHG by limiting OP expansion to areas with moderate or low carbon stocks is most effective. This involves ceasing development of plantations on peatland and enforcing the moratorium on new concessions in primary forests. Governmental policy in Indonesia prohibits the clearing of land by burning, but this is not always enforced, and such enforcement would be a positive step. In addition, rehabilitation and restoration of converted peatlands are an option. Establishing new OP plantations only on degraded or existing agricultural land is highly desirable, although which land is acceptable for OP is debatable. Limiting flooding may prevent increased CH
