<p class="p">Oil palm is scrutinized for its environmental effects, but sustainable cultivation may be possible (Samedani et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0036" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Reducing unnecessary expansion of plantations and ensuring existing ones are managed optimally are crucial. The large CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fluxes from tropical peatlands play an important role in global CC and promoting policies and strategies to manage them more sustainably is important. Mechanisms such as (1) reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, plus conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks (REDD+), (2) national greenhouse gas accounting, and (3) accurate emission factors for C dynamics are essential (Comeau et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Growth of the OP industry may occur on land presently covered by lowland forest, degraded grassland, and agricultural land currently under alternative uses, to avoid conversion of forests and peatland (Germer &amp; Sauerborn, 
 <xref rid="ece33610-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). Plantations are replacing grassland or scrub where the average C content of the plantation will exceed that of the previous vegetation and so becoming a greater C sink.
