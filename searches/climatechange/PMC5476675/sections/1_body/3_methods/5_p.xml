<p class="p">In the following step, the baseline model was used for future projections under the IPCC-5 RCP 4.5 and 8.5 climate change scenarios. RCP 4.5 represents a moderate scenario with stabilization of radiative forcing by 2100

 </sup>. For this, additional climate data was acquired from ccafs-climate. org at a spatial resolution of 5 arcmin, covering the time steps of 2021–2040, 2041–2060 and 2061–2080. To account for uncertainties in climate modelling, data from 5 different global climate models (CESM 1 bcg, FIO ESM, GISS e2-r, INM CM4 and MPI-ESM-lr) were used for 5 separate sets of projections, from which a mean was then calculated for each time step and scenario. Mobility-Oriented Parity analysis (MOP) was applied in order to exclude potential bias in projections due to non-analogue climatic conditions

 </sup>. Areas of low similarity to the calibration areas and strict extrapolation were consistently restricted to climatically extreme regions such as the Sahara and Atacama deserts as well as Greenland, where harsh climatic conditions would certainly exclude chikungunya anyway.
