<p class="p">The final baseline model was fit with these variables, using Maxent at default settings with a maximum of 1000 iterations. A 10-fold cross-validation was conducted for model validation, consisting of 10 separate runs with different sets of training data (used for fitting the model) and test data (used for testing model performance). Models were evaluated using partial receiver operating characteristics

 </sup>, using 1000 bootstrapping iterations on 50% of the test data using an expected error rate of 5%. AUC ratios consistently were significantly larger than 1, suggesting good model performance.
