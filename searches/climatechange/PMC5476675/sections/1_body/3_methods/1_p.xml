<p class="p">We compiled a global database of ca. 700 geo-referenced localities of confirmed autochthonous Chikungunya virus transmission from Promedmail, literature records, PAHO- and CARPHA-reports as well as global and local news outlets up until January 2015 (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref> and supplementary data). The majority of these records (73%) came from Asia, followed by the Americas (16%), Africa (9%) and Europe (2%). For some countries, we were forced to use centroids (geographical centres) of districts as geo-located regions (e.g. Bhutan, India, Thailand and Reunion Island). This may either be due to the reporting system (in case that no detailed coordinates or cities were mentioned), or to major outbreaks affecting whole districts. After removing duplicates as well as locations with insufficiently precise coordinates or missing climatic data coverage, 615 localities remained for use in the modelling process.
