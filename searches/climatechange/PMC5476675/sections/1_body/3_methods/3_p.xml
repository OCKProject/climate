<p class="p">Selection of bioclimatic variables to be used in the final model was done using the “Jackknife” utility implemented in Maxent
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">43</xref>
 </sup> on a test run with all 19 Bioclim variables offered by Worldclim. This measures the effect each input variable has on the model’s training gain when a) the variable is considered in isolation and b) in combination with other variables, when this specific variable is dropped from the subset. For highly covarying variables only the one showing most influential potential in the Jackknife was considered for the final model. Based on this, the 5 most influential variables were:
 <list list-type="bullet" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Annual mean temperature (bio 1)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Minimum temperature of the coldest month (bio 6)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Mean temperature of the wettest quarter (bio 8)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Mean temperature of the warmest quarter (bio 10)</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Annual precipitation (bio 12)</p>
  </list-item>
