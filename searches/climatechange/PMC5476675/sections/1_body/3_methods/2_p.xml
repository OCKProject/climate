Bioclimatic variables are derived from monthly temperature and rainfall values in order to generate biologically meaningful variables, representing annual trends, seasonality and extreme or limiting environmental factors. Those bioclimatic variables were referred to those sites with presence records, using the Maximum Entropy algorithm implemented in Maxent 3.3.3k

 </sup>. Maxent is a commonly used method for predicting species distributions based on environmental variables and capable of accounting for interactions between variables. Instead of absence data, Maxent uses so-called background samples randomly drawn from the environment surrounding the presence records, accounting for the possibility of incorporating data from locations where the modelled species occurs but was not recorded. The maximum distance to the occurrence records from within which these background samples are drawn must be carefully chosen in order to avoid over- and underfitting

 </sup>, but are primarily geared towards single species of higher organisms and do not necessarily translate well for complex virus-vector-host systems. As the dispersal potential of both the pathogen and its vectors is large due to human traffic, we opted for a buffer-based approach for estimating this potential. We produced a series of test models using buffer zones with radii between 0.1 and 10°. The resulting maps were carefully examined for artefacts such as high climatic suitability being predicted for obviously unsuitable areas or being limited only to the immediate surroundings of presence records. In our case, a buffer zone with a radius of 3° gave the best results. In order to come up with the challenge of spatial autocorrelation in data and to avoid spatial clustering in those regions with high numbers of documented cases (quantity effect) we created a spatial bias file as outlined by Elith
