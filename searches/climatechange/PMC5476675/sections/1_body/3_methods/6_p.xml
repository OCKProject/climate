<p class="p">Human population density was deliberately not included as an explanatory variable for the climate-driven distribution model. Initial test runs showed that Chikungunya occurrence was (as expected) highly correlated with human population density, which dominated the models to a degree that climate effects were completely obfuscated. Instead, a post-hoc approach was applied that combines the results of the climate-driven models and human population density into a hazard index. For that, information on human population density was acquired from the Gridded Population of the World dataset

 </sup>. On a 2.5 arcmin resolution raster, this dataset contains the predicted population density for the year 2015. To gain meaningful results, the population data was log-transformed. Afterwards values were scaled to a range between 0 and 1 to be comparable with the scale of the output of the climate-driven models. The 5 arcmin grid of the models was up-sampled to the finer 2.5 arcmin grid of the population data using a straight-forward “nearest neighbour” approach, and the two data sets were multiplied to gain a hazard index. For all future projections, human population density was held constant, as there were no reliable future projections of population development available for the whole study period and area.
