<p class="p">The models developed in this study focus solely on the climatic suitability of Chikungunya transmission based upon five explanatory variables identified during the modelling process: Annual mean temperature, minimum temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the wettest quarter, mean temperature of the warmest quarter and annual precipitation. Present-day (or baseline) models for climatic suitability for Chikungunya transmission were developed (top-left panel, Figs
