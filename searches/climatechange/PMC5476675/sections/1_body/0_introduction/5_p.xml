<p class="p">In this study, geospatially reported cases of Chikungunya were related to climatic factors so as to deduce the most influential climatic variables governing Chikungunya transmission. The characteristics of this niche were then used to assess the current global suitability for Chikungunya. Thereafter, the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5

 </sup> climate change scenarios were used to project how the global suitability for Chikungunya transmission might change in the future. In this context, high “climatic suitability” indicates an increased potential for Chikungunya transmission to occur but does not necessarily mean that actual outbreaks will take place, as public health control measures and overall levels of socioeconomic development could serve as mitigating measures.
