<p class="p">Under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios, climate suitability maps for Chikungunya transmission were developed for the time periods of 2021–2040, 2041–2060, and 2061–2080 (Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>, left panels) based on data from 5 different global climate models. In addition, maps of Chikungunya hazard, which additionally account for human population densities, were developed (RCP 8.5 depicted in Figs
