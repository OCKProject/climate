<p class="p">Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne arboviral disease transmitted by 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> species mosquitoes, notably 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic>. Historically endemic in tropical climates such as in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, events of the past decade have led to a substantial geographic expansion of the disease. In 2005-06, an outbreak with nearly 1.4 million reported cases occurred in India

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2</xref>

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> was recorded in temperate continental Europe for the first time in northern Italy in 2007

 </sup>, from which it subsequently spread to at least 45 countries and territories, leading to at least 1.7 million suspected cases. This illustrates how the disease continues to disperse internationally and pose a threat to public health.
