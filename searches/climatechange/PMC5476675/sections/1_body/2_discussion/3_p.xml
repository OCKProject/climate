<p class="p">There are, broadly speaking, two key approaches for modelling vector-borne diseases. One is mechanistic modelling, which requires a detailed parameterization of numerous intricate biological processes, such as mosquito breeding and survival rates, mosquito biting rates, and the extrinsic incubation period. Although these models are thorough and based upon clear biological processes, there are important limitations to this approach. One relates to the unavailability of empirical data for the parameterization of biological processes, which may be a particular challenge for diseases such as Chikungunya which are relatively understudied. Another limitation is that modelling biological processes alone may tend to lead to overestimations (i.e. false positives) of the impacts of climate change, because they do not account for socioeconomic contexts or potential public health control measures
