 </sup>, anticipate less Chikungunya transmission in temperate regions than the other ones. This may simply be a surveillance artefact: current records of Chikungunya transmission in these areas are comparably sparse, possibly because Chikungunya is not generally expected in these regions by public health practitioners, which would mean that there is a gap in surveillance and, consequently, that our models under-estimate Chikungunya hazard in these areas. Conversely, perhaps more plausibly, it could mean that there may be additional effects of temperature that prevent Chikungunya transmission but not vector presence. It is important to note that while it is generally assumed that the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP) for Chikungunya is shorter than for Dengue, there are to our knowledge no systematic laboratory or field studies on how the EIP for Chikungunya changes at moderate to low temperatures. Even for Dengue, which is relatively well-studied, data on this is sparse and partially problematic
