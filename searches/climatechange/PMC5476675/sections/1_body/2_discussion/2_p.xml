<p class="p">This is, to our knowledge, the first global study on spatio-temporal patterns of potential Chikungunya transmission using the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 climate change scenarios. The modelling algorithms applied in this study to generate spatially explicit hazard maps for established climate change scenarios and time steps are based upon a correlative niche modelling approach to identify global regions that may be climatically favourable for Chikungunya transmission.</p>
