<p class="p">Finally, although calculating values for the mean climatic suitability from the climatic projections obtained from 5 different GCMs generally helps to increase confidence in the globally detected patterns (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S6</xref> for standard deviations), small-scale differences in projected climate may lead to local under-estimations of climatic suitability (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). Global models are only capable of displaying large-scale patterns and are best used for identifying areas of concern which could be further examined by subsequent smaller-scale models that would be better capable of representing locally relevant factors, such as the abundance of mosquito breeding sites, efforts in vector control, and local public health surveillance, preparedness, and response measures related to Chikungunya.
