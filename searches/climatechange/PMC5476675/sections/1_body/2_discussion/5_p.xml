<p class="p">A second limitation relates to the climatic input data. While the climate data used for the baseline model and future projections represent the same climatic parameters (such as “minimum temperature of the coldest month”), the underlying input data and methods are different. The Worldclim dataset for the baseline model is interpolated from data measured by weather stations

 </sup>, whereas the data used for future projections comes from global climate models (GCM) that simulate physical processes in the atmosphere numerically. Although the approach of using those two data sources together has been widely applied, the comparability between baseline and future models is restricted nevertheless.
