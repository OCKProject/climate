 </sup> deviate from all other models by suggesting up to 5 consecutive months of potential transmission in the dry desert climates south of Trelew, Argentina as well as in a narrow strip along the western coast as far south as Los √Ångeles, Chile. This is most likely due to the omission of precipitation and low-temperature limits as explanatory variables, as the very dry climate reduces availability of breeding sites for the vectors. In all other regions, Chikungunya transmission is possible in all models, though the distribution of relatively high and low suitability differs vastly among models.
