<p class="p">Nonetheless, as with all modelling approaches, there are limitations to correlative niche modelling as well. First, vector-borne disease transmission is very complex, involving drivers across a wide range of socioeconomic and climatic variables. In the models presented here, socioeconomic vulnerabilities and related driving forces of Chikungunya transmission are intentionally excluded because the whole array and the diversity of processes in different continents and countries cannot be feasibly modelled. The models may nonetheless be indirectly affected by socio-economic and public health factors which may either protect against or exacerbate Chikungunya transmission. For example, there is historic evidence for Chikungunya occurring in relatively cool sub-tropical climates (such as Charleston, South Carolina, USA)

 </sup>, but due to vector control and other measures current cases in those regions are sparse. Similarly, our models do not attempt to consider future adaptive measures that might be undertaken to mitigate the risk of Chikungunya transmission. Instead, we present models that identify hazard through the combination of climatic suitability and population density (right panels, Figs
