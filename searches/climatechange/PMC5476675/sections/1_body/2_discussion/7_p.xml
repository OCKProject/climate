<p class="p">In comparing our baseline models with other recently-published works on Chikungunya

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>, 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>
 </sup> and its vectors
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>, there are general agreements at large scales, albeit with smaller-scale differences. In Oceania, for example, our model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), the Chikungunya model by Nsoesie 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup> as well as the vector models by Kraemer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup> all cover the same general suitability areas between India, southern Japan and northern Australia. However, the model by Nsoesie 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">22</xref>
 </sup> predicts comparably low environmental suitability in India (from where large numbers of Chikungunya cases have been reported, compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref> and supplementary data), south-eastern China, southern Japan and northern Australia. When compared to the models by Kraemer 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>
 </sup>, our model corresponds more closely to the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> model than the 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> model for this region, but with lesser projected climatic potential for Chikungunya in the northern parts of India, where Chikungunya cases are currently less common (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>).
