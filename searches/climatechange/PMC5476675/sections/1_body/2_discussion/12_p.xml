 </sup>, areas of very high climatic potential for Chikungunya transmission are more locally constrained in our model. Their vector model identifies suitable climatic conditions in Portugal and south-western Spain as well as nearly all coastal regions along the Mediterranean Sea. While many of these regions are not identified as highly climatically suitable areas for Chikungunya transmission in our model, it must be noted that they still represent a raised potential for Chikungunya transmission and should not be interpreted as low-risk areas.
