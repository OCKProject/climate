<p class="p">The novel models presented here demonstrate projected shifts in the climatic suitability for Chikungunya globally over the next century to identify regions with comparatively high hazards of Chikungunya transmission. The models project a net global increase in climate suitability for Chikungunya transmission by 2100, albeit with some important exceptions. Given the continued expectation for rapid global viral spread of Chikungunya alongside significant projected climatic changes over the next century, the models presented here can substantially contribute to integrated planning processes linking climate change adaptation with public health preparedness for mosquito-borne diseases.</p>
