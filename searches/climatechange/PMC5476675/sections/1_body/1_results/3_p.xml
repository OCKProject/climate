<p class="p">In Sub-Saharan Africa, climatically suitable areas are projected to increase within the 2021–2040 timeframe and remain relatively stable thereafter under both climate change scenarios (Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Highly suitable regions include the Atlantic coast from Senegal through to mid Angola, and a belt beginning in West Africa and continuing through to South Sudan. Most of the Indian Ocean coastline is also projected to be suitable for Chikungunya, with the exception of the Horn of Africa and South Africa. The risk of autochthonous transmission will be principally restricted to the more populated coastal areas of Somalia, Tanzania, and Mozambique (Fig.
