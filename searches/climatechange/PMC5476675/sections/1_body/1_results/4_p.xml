<p class="p">The climatic suitability for Chikungunya transmission is projected to steadily increase in the Gulf Coast, southern Florida, Cuba, the Yucatan peninsula, Sinaloa, and across much of Central America under both higher and lower emission scenarios (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). In South America, our models identify a southerly expansion of climatic suitability for Chikungunya transmission, with a marked increase in eastern Peru, eastern Bolivia, Paraguay, and much of central Brazil (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). The high elevation areas of Chile, Bolivia, and Peru will remain unsuitable for Chikungunya transmission. Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, the over-all level of climatic suitability in South America is projected to decrease by the end of the century, when the climatic conditions will be too extreme for the vector species in many regions.
