<p class="p">Projections for two contrasting climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) show rather similar global patterns in the suitability- and hazard maps that were generated in this study. However, the modelling results for the high emission scenario, RCP 8.5 indicate areas of higher climatic suitability and larger expanse of suitable areas. Nevertheless, we also find areas with declining suitability as well as spatial contraction of suitable areas.  In Asia, the models suggest that both climatic suitability and Chikgununya hazard will generally increase in large parts of China, which had been largely free of autochthonous Chikungunya transmission until the 2010 outbreak in the Guangdong Province

India shows a gradual decrease in climatic suitability in its central regions, with persistently strong suitability continuing in the southern regions. Southeast Asia and northern Australia demonstrate strong transmission suitability throughout all time periods, with considerably lower hazard in much of Australia due to low population densities.
