 <p class="p">S.T. and D.F. provided the original concept of the approach and wrote parts of the text. N.T. and D.F. developed the idea for applying Chikungunya models to novel climate change scenarios (“Representative Concentration Pathways”). D.F. compiled the original Chikungunya occurrence data set and built the first test models. N.T. updated the Chikungunya occurrence data set, built the models, prepared the figures and compiled the manuscript. J.S. wrote parts of the text. C.B. and J.S. coordinated and supervised the project. All authors discussed the methodology and results, and reviewed the manuscript.</p>
