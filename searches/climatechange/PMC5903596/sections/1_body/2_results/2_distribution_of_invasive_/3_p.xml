<p class="p">Even a moderate climate change scenario will lead to an expansion of the distribution of the 11 IAPS, which might pose threat to the native flora. Out of the 11 species, six are distributed in scrub vegetation and five in the subtropical needle-leaved forest. The current distribution of invasive plant species ranges between an altitude of 622 m to 2865 m; however, under future conditions (RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) the distribution is predicted to expand towards both upper and lower elevation ranging from 448 m to 3547 m.</p>
