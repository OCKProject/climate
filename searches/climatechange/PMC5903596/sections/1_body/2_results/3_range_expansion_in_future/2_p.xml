<p class="p">At present 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">karvinskianus</italic> is widely distributed and concentrated in central and southeastern parts of the landscape at an elevation range of 677 m to 2566 m with secondary scrub as the dominant vegetation. Under future prediction, it is expected that its distribution will expand in the southern belt, SE of Pithoragarh, SE and SW of Darchula, NE and SE of Baitadi and south of Bajhang. In the future, the distributional range will expand upward by 981m and downward by 200 m. Hence, the distributional elevation range of 
 <italic class="italic">E</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">karvinskianus</italic> will be from 477 m to 3547 m. Currently, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">camara</italic> is distributed between 829 m to 1975 m in the central west and SE region of the landscape (along with the border of West Pithoragarh, and NW of Baitadi and South of Darchula districts) in subtropical needle-leaved forest. In future, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">camara</italic> will expand downward by 359 m. The current distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hysterophorus</italic> is dominant in the central eastern of Pithoragarh, SW of Darchula, patches in south of Baitadi and Bajhang in an elevation range from 686 m to 2050 m predominantly in subtropical needle-leaved forest. In the year 2050 its range will expand by 23 m up and 130 m down compare to present distribution. However, in year 2070, the distributional elevation range expand towards lower elevation up to 238 m down but contracts at an upper elevation by 486 m i.e. the distribution of 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">hysterophorus</italic> in year 2070 will be between 448 m to 1564 m. In future, there will be slight expansion in East of Pithoragarh, NE of Baitadi, SE and SW of Bajhang.
