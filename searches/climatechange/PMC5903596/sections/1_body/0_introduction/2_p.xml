<p class="p">The existing unique landscapes, ecosystems, and biota of Hindu Kush Himalayas (HKH) are spawned as a result of diverse climatic, topographic, geological, and altitudinal variations [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. The HKH region is sensitive and fragile to climate change and is experiencing an annual increase in temperature from 0.03–0.07°C [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Plant invasions in mountain areas are likely to rise because of increase in trade, tourism activities, climate change, and anthropogenic disturbances and can alter both native floral and faunal species composition inducing prolonged negative impacts [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. Over the last few decades, the study of invasions has received much more attention globally and there are a lot of studies focused on mapping the distribution of invasive species, quantifying economic and ecological impacts, and developing efficient and economical management approaches [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. However, the potential expansion of the invasive plants in the HKH region under predicted climate change remains underexplored, especially in the transboundary context that compels us to undertake this study. Our study provides baseline information for understanding the current distribution and predicting the future distribution of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) which are currently in the early stage of invasion and which could be potential threats in the future.
