MaxEnt generates an estimate of the probability of presence of the species that varies from 0 to 1, i.e. from the lowest to the highest probability of distribution. Species presence data and derived all environmental and physiographic data were converted to ASCII file before running the MaxEnt model. Models were built for individual species to predict the distribution of the IAPS under projected climate change scenarios.
