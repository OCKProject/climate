<p class="p">The current distribution of 11 invasive alien plant species (IAPS) in the study area was sampled using geographical positioning system (GPS) during 18–24 June 2015. Since the distribution of the IAPS was most dominant along the road, we recorded the coordinates of the locations of the species using Garmin GPS (GPSmap 62sc) along the road. Road networks often serve as conduit for dispersal of IAPS due to long distance dispersal of propagules by vehicles [

Instead of single highway, we used several network of roads and trails for mapping. Furthermore, roadside environment provided suitable microhabitat for invasive plants which are ruderal in nature. Dispersal of all the invasive species considered in the study are dispersed directly or indirectly by human activities. However,
