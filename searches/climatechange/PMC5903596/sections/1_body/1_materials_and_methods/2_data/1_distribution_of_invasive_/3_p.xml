<p class="p">From the starting point of the survey, at every 10 km distance, field plots of 10 m Ã— 10 m were examined on both sides of the road to record distribution of IAPS. A section of road running south-north parallel to Nepal-India border in Dharcula (India) between Ghatibagar (south) and Tawaghat (north) was examined for the present of invasive alien plant species (IAPS) in every five kilometer road distance. In between these pre-defined locations, some opportunistic observations were also made if we encountered species not recorded in the immediate previous plot. This strategy was used in order to capture maximum possible records and locations of the distribution of IAPS. Altogether 15 IAPS were found in the Nepal region of the KSL; 11 of them with adequate occurrence data have been used in this study (
