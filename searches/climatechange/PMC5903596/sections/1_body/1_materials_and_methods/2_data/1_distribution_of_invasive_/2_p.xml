<p class="p">Interval between successive plots is subjective. Previous study in East Africa Wabuyele et al. used 25 km interval for the survey [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref053" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">53</xref>]. We used 5–10 km interval for the survey. When elevation changes sharply, climate as well as the turn-over of species and vegetation also change shortly. The shorter interval in steep landscape was to capture all vegetation types adequately. It is not only the elevation, but in addition aspect and other topographic factors also change drastically in hill and mountains within a short distance. Therefore, shorter interval is required to adequately represent microhabitats.
