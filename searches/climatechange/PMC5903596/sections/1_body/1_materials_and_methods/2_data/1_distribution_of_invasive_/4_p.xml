<p class="p">For 9 out of 11 species, upper elevation limit of current distribution in the study region is lower than those reported from other parts of Nepal [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Therefore, it is less likely that the current uppermost distribution of these species has reached to climatic limit. Since dispersal of most of these species occurs through human activities, their further spread also depends on increasing human and livestock movements and opening of roads. However, species specific information on dispersal pattern and adaptation to high elevation region is not available for these study species.
