RCP 2.6 represents the lowest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) concentration pathway, whereas RCP 8.5 represents the extreme GHG concentration pathway [

Elevation, slope, and aspect were derived from digital elevation data based on the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) at 90m spatial resolution. Finally, all ancillary layers were resampled to 1 km
