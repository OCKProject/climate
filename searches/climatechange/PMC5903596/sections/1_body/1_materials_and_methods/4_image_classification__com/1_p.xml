<p class="p">The outputs were imported to ArcGIS 10.4 and converted to a.tiff raster format for further analysis. The output maps of the distribution of IAPS generated by MaxEnt were classified into two classes viz., 0.00 to 0.50 and 0.50 to 1.0. We selected pixels with or more 0.5 value to consider areas that depict at least 50% probability of species occurrence. The value greater than 0.5 depicts areas with a highly suitable habitat, while values lower than 0.5 represents low suitability of habitat for invasive plant species. Change detection maps were generated by using difference function in ArcGIS (subtracting future distribution from present distribution) for all IAPS to understand the expansion/ reduction/ no change in the distribution range of these species. The difference maps were then reclassified into three classes where negative values depicted range expansion, positive values depicted range reduction, and zero values depicted no change, and respectively. We quantified the changes in the altitudinal range in the distribution of these species by using the Digital Elevation Model (DEM).</p>
