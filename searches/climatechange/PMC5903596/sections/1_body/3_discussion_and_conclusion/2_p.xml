 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. Bio-climatic variables like minimum temperature of coldest month, mean temperature of driest quarter and mean diurnal range play major role and contribute more to the invasion by 11 IAPS in the present study. Mostly, the expansion of the invasive species might encroach the natural ecosystems of secondary scrub and subtropical needle-leaved forest. The model predicted that
