<p class="p">Effective management of invasive species requires an integrated approach, which includes mechanical, chemical and biological control techniques [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. For example, invasive species can be easily controlled in the initial stages of establishment when the small satellite populations can be physically removed to stop its further spread [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>]. Uprooting the plant before flowering (to control spread by seeds), flooding for short periods of time (
 <italic class="italic">Ageratum conyzoides</italic>), shading by intact canopies (
 <italic class="italic">Lantana camara</italic>) and using herbicides are some of the techniques used to control invasive plant species. Use of biological control agent is one of the tool for management of invasive species. Biological control agents like stem gall fly

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>] and leaf feeding beetle

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref076" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">76</xref>] have been used in the management of invasive species. Moreover, for effective management of invasive species, existing biological control strategies should be complemented with suppressive plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>] and through re-vegetation of degraded sites with competitive native forage grasses [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. In addition, there is an urgent need to strengthen capacity of scientific community, local community and other stakeholders to control IAPS through identification, prevention, and early detection. Finding alternative use of invasive species by local communities is one of the strategies in managing the invasive species [
 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref079" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">79</xref>]. For example, 
 <italic class="italic">L</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">camara</italic> is used to make small scale furniture, bio-briquettes, biochar, farm hedges, fuelwood and as a green manure [

 <italic class="italic">adenophora</italic> has been used as animal bedding, composting, extracting essential oils and odors and have been used as contact poisons or repelling agent’s against herbivore pests in parts of China [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref078" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">78</xref>]. Invasive plant biomass has been also used for the production of biochar [
