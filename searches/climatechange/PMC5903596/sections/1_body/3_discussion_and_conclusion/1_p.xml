<p class="p">Research attempt to model the distribution range of 11 IAPS and identify crucial zones for ecosystem management to regulate degradation in part of Western Himalaya. Most of the studies on predicting the distribution of invasive species have focused on one or two species [

 <xref rid="pone.0195752.ref063" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">63</xref>]. Predicting the future distribution of invasive plants provides insights on their spread under future climate conditions, which in turn can provide the vegetation types prone to degradation because of the invasion. It is essential to identify future invaders and take initial steps in prevention which is the cost-effective means to minimize the spread and impacts of IAPS to new areas.
