<p class="p">Considering the overall modeling scenario, our results demonstrate that the distribution of IAPS in KSL will expand under future climate change and might be a potential threat to the native vegetation. In the future, the distribution range of the species will expand both vertically and horizontally towards South East and North East of KSL. Our model predicted and identified probable areas and types of vegetation invasion. Most of the range expansion of the IAPS will be in the two natural ecosystems viz., secondary scrub and subtropical needle-leaved forest, this will put these natural ecosystems under threat of resource scarcity. Enhancement of our knowledge and understanding about interaction between native species and invasive species considering climate change is imperative for effective conservation and management ecosystems in the Himalaya.</p>
