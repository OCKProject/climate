 <italic class="italic">hysterophorus</italic> upper distribution contracts by 486m but expansion takes place at lower elevation by 238 m. Hence in 2070, the elevation range of

 <italic class="italic">hysterophorus</italic> will be from 686–2050 m to 448–1564 m and mostly it is invading Subtropical needle-leaved forest.
