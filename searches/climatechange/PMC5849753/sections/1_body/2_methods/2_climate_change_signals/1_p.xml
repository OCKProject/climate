<p id="Par17" class="p">Climate change impact analysis is performed for mean and extreme precipitation over the Middle East region. For extreme precipitation, we focus on extreme events with different severities from moderate to rare. Albeit climate model results are more robust for the moderate extreme events, the rare extreme events are more relevant for flood studies. The moderate event is defined as extreme precipitation with 1-year return period (occurrence frequency of once per year). The extreme precipitation with 5- and 15-year return periods are referred to as very extreme event and rare extreme event, respectively. The return period for an empirical distribution is defined as the ratio of the length of the study period to the rank of precipitation values (with rank 1 corresponding to the largest value). The climate change signals are calculated as the ratio of daily extreme precipitation of a given return period for the future time period (2070–2099) to daily extreme precipitation of the same return period for the historical period (1971–2000). Similarly, the signals for mean precipitation are obtained by comparing the climatological mean values of the future and historical time periods. In order to compare the signals between different seasons, all the precipitation indicators are calculated separately for winter (December-January-February: DJF), spring (March-April-May: MAM), summer (June-July-August: JJA) and autumn (September-October-November: SON).</p>
