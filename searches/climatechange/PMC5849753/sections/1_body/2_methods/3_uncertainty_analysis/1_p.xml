<p id="Par19" class="p">Although combining climate change results from different members of a model ensemble into a single projection (i.e., mean ensemble) presents a user-friendly information for policymakers and stakeholders, it conceals the uncertainty in the ensemble projections. The WAS-CORDEX RCM ensemble used here includes two RCMs forced by six CMIP5 GCMs and two emission scenarios (RCPs). The total uncertainty in mean and extreme precipitation changes is the sum of the RCM uncertainty arising from the WAS-CORDEX RCMs, the GCM uncertainty arising from the driving CMIP5 GCMs and the scenario uncertainty (referred to as RCP uncertainty in this paper) arising from the forcing scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. As the larger sample size of the GCMs compared to the RCMs and the RCPs can affect the amount of the GCM uncertainty, the variance decomposition-same sample size (VD-SSS) approach developed by Hosseinzadehtalaei

 </sup> is used for GCM uncertainty quantification. Following the VD-SSS approach, first the multi-model medians of the climate change signals of the WAS-CORDEX ensemble regarding each GCM are computed. Afterwards, two (common sample size among the uncertainty components in our case) GCMs are randomly sampled from the GCM population (six GCMs in our case) in the framework of a bootstrapping technique and the standard deviation between the multi-model medians of the two sampled GCMs is calculated. This procedure is repeated a large number of times and the median of the standard deviations represents the GCM uncertainty. For the RCM and RCP uncertainty, we use the conventional variance decomposition (VD) method. The RCM (RCP) uncertainty is computed as the standard deviation between the multi-model median of the climate change signals of the WAS-CORDEX ensemble following the REMO2009 RCM (RCP4.5) and that following the RCA4 RCM (RCP8.5).
