<p id="Par11" class="p">To compare the climate change signals from the WAS-CORDEX RCMs and the driving CMIP5 GCMs, the ensemble downscaling signal (EDS) is calculated, with a positive (negative) EDS denoting a larger (smaller) change by RCMs compared to driving GCMs (see Methods for the computational procedure). The results show seasonal differences in EDS of mean and extreme precipitation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). There are also large spatial variations in EDS over the Middle East region (Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). The largest portion of the study region with a positive EDS of mean and extreme precipitation is found for summer, implying greater changes by the WAS-CORDEX RCMs compared to the driving CMIP5 GCMs. Larger changes of summer precipitation from finer scale climate models have also been reported in other parts of the worlds

 </sup>. The positive EDS for summer covers between 60% and 83% of the land area. Moreover, there is the lowest consistency (land area with −10≤ EDS ≤10) between the results of the RCM and the GCMs for both mean and extreme precipitation in summer (Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref>). The discrepancy between the RCM and GCM results is because of their different parameterizations of local topographical forcings and different responses to sea surface temperature changes, the land–atmosphere interaction and the soil moisture/precipitation feedback

 </sup>. Winter has the smallest area fraction with a positive EDS for RCP4.5, indicating smaller changes from the WAS-CORDEX RCMs for this emission scenario in comparison to the driving CMIP5 GCMs. For RCP8.5, the smallest land fraction with a positive EDS is found in spring for rare extreme and very extreme events and in autumn for moderate extreme and mean precipitation. In terms of consistency (land area with −10≤ EDS ≤10), there is the highest consistency between the GCM and RCM results for spring (Figures 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S12</xref>). This shows the low sensitivity of the climate change signals of extreme and mean precipitation to the physics and the internal dynamics of the models

 </sup> in spring, while the signals are highly sensitive in summer. Moreover, the consistency generally decreases from mean precipitation to rare extreme events for all seasons and from RCP4.5 to RCP8.5 for all seasons except for Autumn.
