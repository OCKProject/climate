<p id="Par13" class="p">Albeit use of RCMs adds an extra tier of complexity to model fine-scale processes and phenomena relevant for climate change impact assessment at the local level hence with a probably reduced bias, it introduces a further dimension of uncertainty. Our results indicate that the total uncertainty in climate change signals of mean and extreme precipitation vary with seasons, with summer having the largest uncertainty. Similarly, the relative contributions of GCMs, RCMs and RCPs to the total uncertainty are consistent for mean and extreme precipitation, but vary with seasons. The boundary forcing of GCMs makes the greatest contribution to uncertainty in all seasons except for summer when RCMs play the most important role. Because the WAS-CORDEX RCMs (as for other CORDEX ensembles) are nested in a limited number of the CMIP5 GCMs, the obtained uncertainty is expected to be only a fraction of the total possible uncertainty and including more CMIP5 GCMs in the dynamical downscaling framework of the WAS-CORDEX RCMs may expand the uncertainty range. In addition, the scenario uncertainty may be underestimated since the extreme low emission scenario of RCM2.6 is not included in the CORDEX RCM projections.</p>
