<p class="p">We used amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers to test for genetic differentiation in coexisting populations of established individuals of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Festuca ovina</italic> exposed to 15 years of experimental climate manipulations at BCCIL. Simulated climate change could lead to genetic differentiation in this system through two processes: genetic drift and ecologically adaptive evolution. Genetic drift may be induced if a novel climate leads to altered demography (specifically, changes in subpopulation size or modified gene flow between treatments and individual plots; Ellstrand &amp; Elam, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). The effects of drift are expected to be genomewide, leading to a consistent pattern of genetic differentiation across loci. Adaptive responses, on the other hand, are expected to accrue through selection on variation at individual gene loci that control adaptive phenotypes. In this case, we would expect to see a pattern of excess (outlier) differentiation at a limited number of selected loci against a background of genomewide differentiation imposed by drift. Crucially, neutral spatial genetic structure is not expected to lead to genetic structuring among climate treatments at BCCIL, as treatment plots are evenly replicated over spatial blocks in this experiment (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). We combined multivariate and outlier analyses of genetic data with information on species‐level demography and abundance to assess first whether 15 years of simulated climate change had resulted in genetic differentiation and, second, whether genetic change was consistent with an evolutionary (adaptive) response to climatic selection.
