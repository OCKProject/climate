<p class="p">Although previous studies suggest adaptive responses to environmental selection, there have been very few direct experimental tests of genetic responses to climate change in plant species within intact ecosystems (Jump

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Such tests are important, because they tell us about the capacity for neutral or adaptive genetic change in ecologically realistic settings that may incorporate competition from coexisting species, or fine‐scale abiotic heterogeneity that interferes with climatic selection. Avolio

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0003" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>) used AFLP markers to demonstrate changes in clonal structure of the grass 
 <italic class="italic">Andropogon gerardii</italic> in response to manipulation of precipitation regimes in a prairie ecosystem, but did not identify a clear adaptive component to these changes. Jump 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008b</xref>) used an outlier analysis to identify adaptive divergence in response to simulated drought and warming in 
 <italic class="italic">Fumana thymifolia</italic> within a Mediterranean shrub community, focussing on the establishing (seedling) phase of the plant life cycle. Thus, we know very little regarding either the extent to which climatic selection can drive adaptive divergence within plant populations occupying intact ecosystems, or about adaptive responses in the established (reproductively mature) phase of perennial plant species.
