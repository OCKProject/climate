<p class="p">The argument for a climatically adaptive response to selection is supported by recent common environment experiments using plants collected from BCCIL documenting climate‐associated evolutionary changes in phenotype in both of our study species (Ravenscroft 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; R. Whitlock, unpublished data). For example, when grown in a common environment, 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> individuals from the drought plots at BCCIL make a greater investment in reproductive output, whereas those from control plots allocate more resources to vegetative growth (Ravenscroft 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). The expression of differentiated phenotypes under a common environment demonstrates a genetic basis to phenotypic differentiation. Thus, these studies show that populations of grassland plants at BCCIL are capable of evolutionary responses to climatic selection.
