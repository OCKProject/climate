<p class="p">Our results are novel in demonstrating rapid genetic divergence in the established (reproductively mature) phase of perennial plant species in an intact ecosystem in response to a suite of simulated climate change environments. As the climate treatments are replicated in a spatially blocked experimental design (Grime 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>), it seems likely that this divergence has arisen specifically in response to the climate treatments themselves, in parallel with community‐level compositional change (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Furthermore, genetic divergence has occurred over a relatively small period of evolutionary time (15 years of experimentation is ≤ 15 generations for our study species). Our findings are consistent with a scenario in which climate‐induced selection imposed at BCCIL has driven climatically adaptive genetic divergence, against a background of weak differentiation maintained by gene flow. However, it is important to note that, based on the available data, we cannot exclude the possibility that genetic drift has contributed to differentiation among climate change treatments at BCCIL. Future work at BCCIL will focus on verifying and functionally characterizing the genomic signature of climatic selection documented in this study and will seek to determine the relationship between climatically selected genotypes, climatically adaptive phenotypes and species abundance.
