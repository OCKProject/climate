<p class="p">Our survey data suggested that 15 years of experimental climate change had altered population density within some of the experimental treatments (in particular, the drought, heated and heated‐drought treatments; Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a, b), indicating modified patterns of survival and recruitment within these environments. These changes are known to have altered community structure at fine spatial scales (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Such demographic responses may be sufficient to induce neutral genetic change through drift and the loss of genetic diversity at low population size, assuming that subpopulations at BCCIL are isolated demographically. Our data, however, did not provide evidence in support of this effect. Levels of gene diversity within individual plots were not associated with either (long‐term) estimates of population abundance or population density, for either species. Furthermore, although we found evidence in both species for genetic differentiation in all treatments except the winter warming treatment (permutational 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc> analysis), there was no obvious link between the extent or presence of genetic differentiation and treatment‐mediated changes in population density. Hence, neither genetic diversity nor genetic differentiation was associated consistently with sustained changes in population size at BCCIL.
