<p class="p">Effective gene flow would be expected to homogenize the distribution of genetic variation at selectively neutral loci, limiting the effects of drift within subpopulations at BCCIL (Wright, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1931</xref>). Such gene flow may be especially likely in our study species, which produce wind‐dispersed pollen and are highly outcrossing (Morjan &amp; Rieseberg, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0050" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Analyses of fine‐scale spatial genetic structure were consistent with panmixia at putatively neutral AFLP loci at, or exceeding, the scale of the experimental blocks at BCCIL (~9 m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>; each climate treatment is represented in every block). Cross‐fertilization between plant populations can occur at appreciable rates at scales of 100–1000 m (Ellstrand, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0015" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), and thus, the spatial scale of the experiment at BCCIL is unlikely to pose a problem for gamete (pollen) movement among climate change treatments. Moreover, the low levels of genetic differentiation observed among the climate treatments at putatively neutral (nonoutlier) AFLP loci (median

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0054" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>; Text S7, Figures S8 and S9) provide further support for the prevalence of gene flow, indicating only very weak genetic structure that was not associated with simulated climate change treatments. Finally, recent studies of floral phenology suggest substantial overlaps in flowering time between subpopulations occupying different climate treatments at BCCIL (S. Buckland, unpublished data). Thus, we have no reason to believe that any barrier to gene flow has arisen through asynchrony in floral timing, which could otherwise have facilitated genetic drift (Fox, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>; Hendry &amp; Day, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2005</xref>). We conclude that it is extremely unlikely that climatic subpopulations at BCCIL have become demographically isolated from each other. Hence, it also seems unlikely that genetic drift has had a marked impact on treatment‐level genetic structure.
