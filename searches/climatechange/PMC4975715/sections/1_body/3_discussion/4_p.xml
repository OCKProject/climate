<p class="p">Outlier analyses detected a consistent signature of selection in response to simulated climate change at individual AFLP loci in 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic>. Two outlier loci, identified in both outlier analyses, showed genetic differentiation (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> ≈ 0.2) greatly exceeding the average background genetic differentiation at putatively neutral loci in this species (median 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.003). Genome regions associated with the two outlier loci identified consistently in 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> represent candidate targets for climatic selection and may control phenotypes that are adaptive under the modified climates at BCCIL. The observed genetic differentiation at the putatively selected AFLP loci occurred against a background of low genomewide differentiation. As we argue above, low levels of background differentiation are likely to have been maintained by gene exchange among grassland plots. Thus, implying that climatic selection has had to work against gene flow to establish divergence at the genome regions putatively responding to selection.
