<p class="p">We investigated species' genetic responses to 15 years of simulated climate change applied to intact species‐rich limestone grassland, focusing on two of the most abundant species within the community. Our aims were to understand the extent to which genetic responses to the climate are possible within grassland plants, and whether these responses are consistent with a process of evolution in response to climatic selection. We detected genetic differentiation among long‐term climate treatments at BCCIL using both genomewide multilocus analyses (

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub>, permutational 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc>) and single locus‐oriented outlier analyses. This differentiation has occurred within contiguous grassland over a very small spatial extent (thirty 9‐m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> plots spread over approximately 0.2 ha grassland), and happened rapidly, during 15 years of climate change manipulations. Similarly, rapid genetic change occurring in response to a natural drought has been documented in the annual species

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Treatment‐level genetic structure at BCCIL is unlikely to be dominated by neutral spatial genetic structuring because each treatment is replicated in each spatial experimental block. Furthermore, we detected two outlier AFLP loci associated with climate treatment, which possessed patterns of differentiation that were statistically distinct from the background of putatively neutral genomic differentiation. This signature of climatic selection may reflect climate‐driven adaptive evolutionary change within populations at BCCIL.
