<p class="p">Evidence for a response to climatic selection in 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> was equivocal; outlier loci associated with climate change treatment were only detected using logistic regression and were weakly differentiated (

 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> ≈ 0.03; neutral background differentiation = 0.003). Failure to detect a stronger response to climatic selection in 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> may simply represent the absence of a response, but it may also reflect a genomic marker density insufficient to detect such an effect. In other words, linkage disequilibrium (LD), which may create associations between loci responding to climatic selection and neutral loci, may decay too rapidly for our genotyping strategy to be useful. For example, in maize, LD can decay within 10 kb (Flint‐Garcia
