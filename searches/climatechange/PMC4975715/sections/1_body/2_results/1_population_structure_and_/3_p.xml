<p class="p">Both study species showed evidence of spatial genetic structure (regression slopes of pairwise kinship coefficients on distance were significantly negative 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> &lt; 0.001). Neighbourhood sizes (the effective size of locally panmictic units within the population) were 320 and 140, and neighbourhood areas were 9.29 and 9.97 m

 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic>, respectively (assuming an
