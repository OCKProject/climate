 <italic class="italic">Festuca ovina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> populations occupying intact limestone grassland at BCCIL were genetically diverse; gene diversity estimates (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">j</sub>) based on polymorphic AFLP loci were 0.281 and 0.332 for 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic>, respectively. All individuals possessed a unique multilocus AFLP genotype, indicating that all sampled plants represented distinct genetic individuals. Subpopulations of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> that had been exposed for 15 years to different simulated climatic environments possessed closely similar gene diversities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>c). Standard error estimates for gene diversity in 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> indicated weak variation in diversity among climate treatment subpopulations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). Drought‐treated subpopulations of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> had the lowest genetic diversity (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">j</sub> = 0.311), and watered and heated‐drought subpopulations were the most genetically diverse (
 <italic class="italic">H</italic>
 <sub class="sub">j</sub> = 0.338; Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>d). Levels of genetic diversity within these species did not vary consistently along the soil‐depth gradient present at the study site (between shallow and deep soils; Table S4).
