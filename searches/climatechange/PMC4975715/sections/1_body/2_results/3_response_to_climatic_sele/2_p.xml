<p class="p">Logistic regression identified two 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> AFLP loci (X306.3_TCT_CGG_Fo and X327_TCC_CGC_Fo) with significant variation in fragment frequency between climate change treatments (
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.036 and 0.030, respectively). Similar analyses identified eighteen 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> loci as showing outlier patterns of genetic differentiation among climate change treatments, which included the two previously identified outlier loci for this species (range in 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> = 0.021–0.218). Soil depth and the soil depth × treatment interaction were not significant predictors of AFLP fragment frequency for any locus in either study species. Genetic differentiation among climate treatments at putatively neutral (nonoutlier) loci was low for both species (
