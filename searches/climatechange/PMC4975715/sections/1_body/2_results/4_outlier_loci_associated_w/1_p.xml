<p class="p">Outlier analysis using 
 <sc class="sc">bayescan</sc> identified eight 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> loci that showed significant divergence among experimental blocks (i.e. with naturally occurring spatial variation in the block environment; all 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>‐values &lt; 0.1, posterior probability for a response to selection = 0.744–0.999). The same eight loci were present in the sets of candidate outliers identified by analysis of the block environment using logistic regression. In contrast, analysis of the block environment using 
 <sc class="sc">bayescan</sc> did not detect any 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> AFLP locus with an outlier pattern of genetic differentiation (all 
 <italic class="italic">Q</italic>‐values ≥ 0.350).
