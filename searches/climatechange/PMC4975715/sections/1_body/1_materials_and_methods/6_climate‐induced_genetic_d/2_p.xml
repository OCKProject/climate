<p class="p">To determine whether genetic structure was associated with local demographic history, we carried out a regression of plot‐level gene diversity (expected heterozygosity) against plot‐level harmonic mean subpopulation abundance over the 15 years of monitoring at BCCIL and against current subpopulation density. These former abundance data are point quadrat records drawn from Grime

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0030" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>; Fig. S1); population abundance and population density are correlated in this system (see results). Genetic drift is expected to lead to a loss of genetic diversity that is related to local subpopulation size (Crow &amp; Kimura, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1970</xref>). Thus, a positive relationship between local subpopulation size and genetic diversity would provide evidence in support of a role for local demographic isolation and genetic drift (neutral genetic change) in driving population structure at BCCIL. Harmonic mean abundance was used as a predictor for genetic diversity because the effects of drift on diversity in a temporally fluctuating population are expected to be dictated largely by periods of low effective population size (Wright, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0066" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1931</xref>; Crow, 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1964</xref>). These analyses assume that census population sizes or abundance estimates are proportional to effective population sizes.
