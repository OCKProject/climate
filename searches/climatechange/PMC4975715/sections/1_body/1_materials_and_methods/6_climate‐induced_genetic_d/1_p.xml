 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> via 5000 permutations of individuals among climatic subpopulations (incorporating the observed 
 <italic class="italic">F</italic>
 <sub class="sub">ST</sub> as a datum). We used permutational analysis of variance to determine whether genetic distances among individuals could be explained by climate treatment, soil depth, treatment × soil depth interaction or block, using function ‘adonis’ in

Permutational 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc> analyses were conducted on Euclidian genetic distance matrices computed from the AFLP presence–absence data. First we carried out a global permutational 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc> analysis that included all treatment and control climates, in which a treatment × soil depth interaction and block main effects were fitted (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>‐values for treatment effects were identical whether or not blocks were fitted as strata). Second, we performed additional analyses that paired each climate treatment with control. In these permutational 
 <sc class="sc">anova</sc>, we fitted a treatment × soil depth interaction and incorporated blocks as strata. All of these analyses used 1999 permutations of the genetic distance matrix to compute significance tests on the parameter estimates.
