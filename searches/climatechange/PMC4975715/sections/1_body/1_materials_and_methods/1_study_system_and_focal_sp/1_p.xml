<p class="p">Prior to the onset of experimentation in 1993, the vegetation at the BCCIL site comprised an ancient, unimproved sheep pasture located on the side of a dale (valley) near Harpur Hill, Buxton, UK. The experiment now running at BCCIL was set up as a series of 3 × 3 m plots within this pasture, each containing intact species‐rich limestone grassland vegetation. These plots have been exposed to annual climatic treatments since 1993 using a replicated, spatially blocked design. Treatments include (i) winter warming, where soil surface is maintained at 3 °C above ambient (nonmanipulated) temperature from November to April; (ii) drought treatments, where rainfall in July and August is intercepted by automated rain shelters; (iii) water addition (watered), where water is added to experimental plots from June to September at a rate of 20% above the long‐term average; (iv) warming and drought (heated/drought); (v) warming and increased precipitation (heated/watered); and (vi) control. Experimental plots (3 × 3 m) are replicated five times in a randomized block design (Fig.

Soil depth is a major source of fine‐scale environmental heterogeneity within plots, varying from 0 cm (bare rock) to &gt; 30 cm, and influences plant community structure at local scales (Fridley
