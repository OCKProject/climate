 <italic class="italic">Festuca ovina</italic> L. (sheep's fescue, a grass) and 
 <italic class="italic">Plantago lanceolata</italic> L. (ribwort plantain, a forb) are perennial (polycarpic) plants with wide geographical distributions; both species are self‐incompatible (obligate outcrossers) and wind pollinated. Both study species are common in all experimental plots at BCCIL, and both have a limited capacity for clonal growth: 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> via lateral rosette formation and 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> through tillering, typically leading to the formation of loose tussocks. 
 <italic class="italic">Festuca ovina</italic> was both the most frequent of all the species (occurring in 223 of 240 permanent 10 × 10 cm quadrats distributed throughout the grassland at BCCIL) and the species with greatest cover in the plots at BCCIL (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). This species was significantly more abundant in heated, drought‐treated and heated/drought plots and less abundant in watered plots after 15 years of climatic manipulation (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>.,

 <xref rid="gcb12966-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>a). Soil depth was not a significant predictor of 
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic> abundance (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The abundance of 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic> varied with climate treatment, soil depth and a treatment × soil depth interaction (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). The abundance of this species was highest in warming treatments, was lowest in treatments that included drought and varied considerably with soil depth in all experimental treatments (Fridley 
 <italic class="italic">et al</italic>., 
 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>; Fig.
