<p class="p">We tested for the presence of spatial genetic structure (SGS) within each species by regressing pairwise kinship coefficients on the distance separating plant individuals (implemented using the software

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Any loci identified as showing outlier patterns of differentiation among climate treatments under the analyses described below (i.e. those loci putatively responding to climatic selection) were removed prior to the assessment of SGS (
 <italic class="italic">F. ovina</italic>, 48 loci removed; 
 <italic class="italic">P. lanceolata</italic>, 25 loci removed). Significance of the regression slope was tested using 2000 permutations of AFLP genotypes among sampling locations. The extent of SGS was estimated by quantifying Wright's neighbourhood size, which measures the effective population size of locally panmictic units within the total population, and 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> (the gene dispersal parameter), which defines the physical size of these panmictic units (equal to half the expected parent–offspring dispersal distance). These analyses assume that populations have reached drift–dispersal equilibrium and that dispersal is isotropic and also require an estimate of effective population density (methods described in Text S2). Populations were assumed to be in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (i.e.
