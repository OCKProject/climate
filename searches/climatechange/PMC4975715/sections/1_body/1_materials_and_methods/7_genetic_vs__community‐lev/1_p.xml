<p class="p">We carried out two analyses in order to determine whether responses to simulated climate change at BCCIL at the community level were coupled with multilocus genetic responses within species. First, we performed correlations of plot‐level species diversity (species richness and Shannon diversity index) with multilocus gene diversity [species abundance data were taken from Fridley
