<p class="p">We estimated population density in order to understand whether the climatic environments at BCCIL had led to demographic changes that could have driven changes in genetic structure. Closest individual density estimation was used to assess population density for each study species, exploiting the known distance between the centres of the 100 cm
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> quadrats and the nearest individual of each of our study species (Cottam

Population density at BCCIL can be used as a proxy for population size on the basis that each of the plots and each of the treatments have identical areas. Existing species abundance data, collected for 240 of the quadrats, and measured as ordinal vegetation cover class (0 = 0–4%; 1 = 5–24%; 2 = 25–49%; 3 = 50–74%; 4 = 75% +; Fridley

 <xref rid="gcb12966-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) were used to create plot‐level and treatment‐level summaries of species abundance. This cover‐based measure of species abundance is a function of both local plant density and plant morphology.
