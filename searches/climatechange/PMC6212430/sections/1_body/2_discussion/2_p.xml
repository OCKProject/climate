<p id="Par25" class="p">While we believe the results of our observational analysis are highly suggestive of the causes of the 2017 extremely strong TC activity as summarized above, a natural follow-up step is to carry out model experiments that would allow a more direct assessment of the nature of the remarkably warm SST and OHC due to both climate change and climate variability, as those experiments are found in

 </sup>. Such experiments would likely require a model that is coupled to the ocean (rather than an AGCM) to allow addressing the role of OHC, and has high enough resolution to address the possible roles of spatial (and temporal) scales smaller (shorter) than those considered here, including the possible role of African easterly waves.
