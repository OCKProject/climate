<p id="Par26" class="p">Understanding the implication of these results for the future requires that the 2017 hurricane season be considered in the context of past seasons. Simply assuming that the SST continues to increase for the next few decades due to global warming, some enhancement of seasonal TC activity can be expected, including the development of hurricane–level TCs

 </sup>. On the other hand, seasonal TC activity over the past few decades displays considerable interannual variability that is largely determined by the leading modes of climate variability, indicating that a gradual warming alone does not play the dominant role

 </sup>. In fact, the most extreme TC seasons in the recent past tended to occur when these modes of climate variability provide favorable conditions for TC activity (e.g., 2005 was characterized by a very strong positive AMM and 2010 was characterized by a positive AMM and La Niña conditions). In contrast, the recent weak TC activity in 2014 and 2015, for example, occurred in the presence of El Niño conditions during summer, which would tend to suppress TC activity. The weak TC activity with many short TC tracks somehow coincided with a positive phase of the NAO in 2013, while the ENSO and AMM signals were rather weak. Strong anti-cyclonic Rossby wave breaking, which tends to be more active during the positive phase of the NAO
