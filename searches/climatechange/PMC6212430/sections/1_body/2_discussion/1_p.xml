<p id="Par24" class="p">This study examined the causes of the extremely strong 2017 Atlantic TC activity, focusing particularly on AS when much of the activity occurred. A key factor suggested was the record-setting warm SST over the EMDR, driven primarily by the climate change signal (~0.42 °C above the 1901–2017 average) and the AMM that accounted for 80% of the additional (beyond the trend) warming of ~0.54 °C. As such, a majority of the tropical disturbances that developed into strong TCs (Gert, Harvey, Irma, Jose, Lee, and Maria) had their genesis in the EMDR. In addition, the MDR had the third warmest SST on record exceeded only by 2010 and 2005. This was accompanied by record-setting OHC over most of the North Atlantic that acted to maintain the warm ocean surface and facilitated the strengthening of the TCs as they traversed the Atlantic. Atmospheric conditions (e.g., wind shear, SLP, PI, and upper-level outflow temperature) also provided very favorable conditions for TC activity over the Atlantic with the maximum over the EMDR, but these factors were overall less prominent than in 2005 and 2010 across the entire Atlantic basin. ENSO, the NAO, and the AMM together provided the favorable wind shear conditions, while the AMM also produced the very warm ocean and enhanced atmospheric instability.</p>
