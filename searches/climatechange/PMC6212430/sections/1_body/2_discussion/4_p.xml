<p id="Par27" class="p">The above cases indicate that, even in the presence of climate change characterized by increasing SST, it is the leading modes of climate variability that largely determine the extremes in seasonal TC activity, in that they are associated with both the thermodynamical and dynamical conditions favorable (or unfavorable) for TC development. Nevertheless, we can expect that climate change will play an increasingly important role in determining extremely active years in that it provides an increasingly warmer baseline in SST from which the major modes of climate variability deviate. The 2005 and 2017 hurricane seasons (both characterized by a positive AMM, and weak NAO and ENSO) appear to be consistent with such an interpretation. During those years, the tropical Atlantic SSTs and the major hurricane counts are comparable, despite a relatively smaller magnitude of the positive phase of the AMM in 2017 than in 2005 (e.g., Supplementary Fig.Â
