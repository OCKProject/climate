 </sup>, six major hurricanes developed, with two of them (Irma and Maria) reaching Category 5. The season is ranked as having the third highest number of major hurricanes in a single year over the past century, exceeded only by the 1961 and 2005 seasons. It is the first year since 1893 that 10 consecutive named storms have strengthened into hurricanes. A number of the tropical cyclones (TCs) that developed grew quite quickly to hurricane level and had unusually long life times (Harvey, Irma, Jose, and Maria). The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the Atlantic, a measure of TC intensity and life cycle for the hurricane season, exceeded 220 × 10
