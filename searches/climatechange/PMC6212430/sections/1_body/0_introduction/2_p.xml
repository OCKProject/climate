<p id="Par3" class="p">The goal of this study is to identify the causes of the strong 2017 TC activity, with a focus on the long term trend and the leadingmodes of climate variability that impact seasonal TC activity over the Atlantic. Since almost all the unusual TC activity occurred during the months of August and September (AS), we focus our attention on those months. Previous studies have shown that climate variability influences TC activity through changes in both atmospheric circulation and thermodynamic conditions
