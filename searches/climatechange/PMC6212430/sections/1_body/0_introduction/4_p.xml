<p id="Par5" class="p">Here we focus on the factors that played an important role in producing the extremely active 2017 TC season, especially during August-September (AS). We examine the roles of three well-known modes of climate variability (ENSO, the AMM, and the NAO), along with the SST trend associated with a warming climate. We also compare the anomalous oceanic and atmospheric structures that occurred during 2017 with those observed during the other recent extreme hurricane years of 2005 and 2010.</p>
