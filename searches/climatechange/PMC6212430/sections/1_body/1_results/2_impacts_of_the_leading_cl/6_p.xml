<p id="Par14" class="p">The results show that that PI has a substantial upward trend over the EMDR region,while the OHC and wind shear do not. As such, the total anomaly of the PI consists of both a trend and detrended components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>), while the total anomalies of the OHC and wind shear differ little from the detrended anomaly over the EMDR region (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,b</xref>). Taking a broader look (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6b</xref>), we find that there are regions west of the EMDR where the OHC does have a substantial upward trend component, especially over the western to central extra-tropical Atlantic.
