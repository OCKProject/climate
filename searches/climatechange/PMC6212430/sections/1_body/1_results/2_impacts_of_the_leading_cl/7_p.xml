<p id="Par15" class="p">The most striking feature associated with the leading modes is that they drive higher OHC, weaker wind shear and a vertically more unstable atmosphere than average in AS 2017. For example, the sum of reconstructed anomalies of OHC, wind shear, and PI over the EMDR from individual modes is about 0.29, −0.58, 1.5 (the right three bars in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a–c</xref>), respectively, demonstrating their positive impact on TC activity in AS. We also see that the reconstructed anomalies are generally close to the detrended anomalies, which are 0.28 for OHC (the third left bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>), −0.6 for wind shear (the third left bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3b</xref>) and 1.7 for PI (the third left bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3c</xref>). Comparing the impacts of each mode highlights that the AMM is the key factor driving the ocean and thermodynamic impacts (Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a,c</xref>). In contrast, the wind shear, known to also be dynamically linked to the jet stream, atmospheric pressure and circulation fields associated with ENSO and the NAO, is influenced by all three climate modes (Fig.
