<p id="Par11" class="p">We next quantify the extent to which the detrended SST anomalies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>) can be explained by the leading climate modes of variability. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref> show the reconstructed SST anomaly patterns, obtained by combining the contributions from ENSO, the AMM, and the NAO REOFs (see Methods). The results show that the reconstruction of the SST anomalies based on just the 3 leading REOFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2b</xref>) reproduces reasonably well (though not fully) the actual SST anomaly distributions shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2a</xref>. The bar charts (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) compare the SST anomalies over the EMDR with the anomalies reconstructed from the individual modes, showing that ~80% of the SST anomaly (0.54 °C, third bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) reflects the positive phase of the AMM (~0.43 °C, fifth bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>) during AS 2017, with only a very weak positive contribution from the NAO (sixth bar in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2c</xref>). The contribution from ENSO, which was in a weak La Niña (or nearly neutral)

 </sup> phase during AS 2017, is negligible (fourth bar in Fig.
