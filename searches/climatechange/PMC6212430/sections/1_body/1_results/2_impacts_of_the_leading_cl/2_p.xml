<p id="Par10" class="p">Having established the spatial structure of the leading modes of variability, we can reconstruct those aspects of the 2017 AS SST anomalies (i.e., departures from linear trend) (see Methods) associated with ENSO, the AMM, and the NAO. The left panel in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref> shows the 2017 AS detrended SST anomalies. The MDR is characterized by above-average SSTs, with the largest values in the EMDR. This tropical-wide distribution of the detrended warm anomalies, together with the contribution from the SST trend shown earlier (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d,e</xref>), likely favors not only TC genesis but also the strengthening of the storms as they migrate westward across the Atlantic ocean toward North America. As mentioned earlier, the AS 2017 positive SST anomaly over the EMDR with respect to the 1901–2017 mean (0.96 °C), can be decomposed into a contribution from the linear trend (0.42 °C) and a contribution from interannual and longer term variability (0.54 °C): see the first three bars in Fig.
