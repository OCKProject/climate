<p id="Par9" class="p">In order to assess the contributions of the leading climate modes to the SST anomalies during AS, we decompose the SST anomalies in terms of Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Functions (REOFs, see Methods). The three leading SST REOFs (captured as ENSO, the AMM, and an NAO-related SST pattern), are consistent with those found in previous studies (e.g.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">6</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>) (see Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> and related description) and account for ~65% of the AS interannual SST variance. We note that while the NAO is known to largely originate within the atmosphere, we interpret the REOF shown in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2c</xref> as an NAO-forced SST pattern. The AMM (in its positive phase) stands out with warm SST anomalies across the MDR. Also, the AS SST anomaly over the MDR associated with ENSO is weak, consistent with
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup>. We shall see, however, that the ENSO impact over the tropical Atlantic tends to be more strongly reflected in the vertical wind shear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>).
