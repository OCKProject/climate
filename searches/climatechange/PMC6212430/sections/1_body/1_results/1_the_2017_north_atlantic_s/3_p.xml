We find that although not exceptionally high, the relative SST anomalies are above average during the recent historic active years, such as 1995, 2001, 2005, 2010, and 2017. We note that the super active hurricane years that occurred in the 20th century (e.g., 1933 and 1969) also show higher than average SST, but very large relative SST anomalies are also found in 1945 and 1958, when the TC activity was not especially strong. As such, we might have to conclude that when considering the relative SST anomalies, there is less evidence that the 2017 SST would force an exceptional Atlantic hurricane season, though as
