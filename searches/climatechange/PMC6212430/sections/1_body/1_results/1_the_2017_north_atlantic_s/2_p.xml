<p id="Par7" class="p">The three upper panels in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> show the AS 2017 total SST anomaly, the contribution from the long-term trend (computed for the period 1901–2017), and the detrended anomaly that is presumably composed of interannual and longer-term variability. The distribution of the total anomaly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>) shows a large positive SST anomaly over the MDR with the maximum in the eastern Main Development Region (EMDR), along with both positive and negative anomalies over the mid-latitude Atlantic. The SST anomaly contributed by the long-term linear trend is positive throughout the Atlantic basin (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). The time series in the bottom two panels show the evolution of the SST anomalies over the MDR and the EMDR. The long-term trend contributions to the SST anomalies over the MDR and the EMDR region during 2017 are found to be ~0.37 and ~0.42 °C, respectively (blue lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d,e</xref>). For comparison, the non-trend contributions are ~0.41 and ~0.56 °C over the MDR and the EMDR, respectively. It is evident from Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1d</xref> that the MDR SST is the third highest in 2017, following 2010 and 2005. Interestingly, the SST anomaly in the EMDR region that includes Cape Verde, where several tropical cyclones developed and grew to be major hurricanes during AS 2017 (e.g., Harvey, Irma, and Jose), is the highest on record (~0.96 °C) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1e</xref>). With a climatological value of 26.82 °C, this anomaly translates to a record warm SST value of ~27.8 °C in the EMDR region during AS, which should be quite favorable for TC development.
