 </sup>, had the lowest SLP (and high ranking) largely confined to the western/central North Atlantic (consistent with the TCs that developed there and moved northward): the area of low SLP did extend south to just north of Cuba where, in the presence of favorable wind shear, a number of TCs developed that made landfall over North America (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a</xref>). During 2010, the combined impact of the strong positive AMM, La Niña, and the negative NAO

 </sup> produced positive SST anomalies across the entire tropical Atlantic and a weaker subtropical high (i.e., higher SLP ranking) over the Atlantic (SF
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3d</xref>), leading to more early recurvers and thus fewer landfalls despite enhanced TC genesis
