 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">4</xref> (SF4) and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref> (SF5) compare the SST and OHC between the three years in a more quantitative manner (by providing amplitude information) in order to support our conclusions drawn from ranking analysis. By scaling the SST anomalies in terms of standard deviation, those figures show that each year has a different spatial distribution of where the SST anomalies are largest (greater than 1 or 2 standard deviations), and those regions tend to be juxtaposed with the regions of TC genesis and evolution (SF

 </sup>. For example, the largest SST anomalies are confined to the west in 2005 and to the east in 2017, while 2010 shows large SST anomalies over much of the MDR. Similarly standardized OHC anomalies (SF
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">5</xref>) match well the rankings shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>, and SF
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3b</xref>, supporting our contention that the three years have unique OHC distributions, causing different impacts on TC activity.
