<p id="Par22" class="p">The reasons for the differences between 2017 and the other two extreme years are not immediately clear. The relatively larger amplitude of the AMM during 2005 and 2010 compared with 2017 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2e</xref>) appears to be why the highly favorable atmospheric conditions for strong TC activity extended across much of the North Atlantic during those years while that was not the case for 2017. On the other hand, the more favorable OHC conditions in 2017 compared with 2005 and 2010 appears to be associated with the increasingly more important role of the trend, as computed here for the period 1995–2017 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6b</xref>). This upward trend is primarily observed over the western-central North Atlantic and, unlike for the atmospheric quantities (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">6c–f</xref>), has a distribution that is quite similar to the distribution of the 2017 OHC rankings (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref>). As such, it appears that the larger OHC in 2017 is the combined effect of the trend (most pronounced over the western-central North Atlantic) and the leading modes of climate variability including the AMM that have influences spanning the North Atlantic.
