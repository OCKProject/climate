<p id="Par21" class="p">The above results indicate that it is to a large extent the differences in the phases and intensities of the three leading climate modes that determine the unique TC track patterns observed during these three (2005, 2010, and 2017) strong TC seasons. In particular, the overall very favorable ocean/atmospheric conditions for TC activity is linked to the large amplitude positive phase of the AMM in those years (see the PC and AMM index in Supplementary Fig.Â
