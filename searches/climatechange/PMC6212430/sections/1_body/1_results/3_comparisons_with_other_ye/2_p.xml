 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> depicts the distributions of the rankings for AS 2017. The EMDR (an area of substantial TC genesis during AS 2017) has extensive areas for which AS 2017 is ranked in the top three for SST, OHC, and wind shear (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4a–c</xref>), while this is not the case for SLP. High rankings over the EMDR are also found for PI and outflow temperature. Specifically, OHC, a vital factor that can boost the rapid intensification of hurricanes

 </sup>, is ranked in the top (or close to top) over most of the Atlantic basin, indicating its important role in 2017. The rankings for wind shear and outflow temperature (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c,f</xref>) tend to show high rankings over much of the Caribbean Sea and northward to just north and east of the Bahamas. The highest rankings for SLP occur in narrow swaths along the east coast Mexico, and from the southern Caribbean Sea northward along the east coast of North America. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> overall indicates that a number of key quantities provide very favorable conditions for TC activity in AS 2017, especially over the EMDR. Ocean conditions appear to be even more favorable than atmosphere conditions (as measured by the rankings) for developing intense TCs.
