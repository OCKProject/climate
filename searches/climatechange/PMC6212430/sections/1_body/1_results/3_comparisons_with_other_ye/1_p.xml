<p id="Par16" class="p">In this section, we compare the spatial distributions of various key physical quantities such as vertical wind shear and SLP (dynamical impact), PI and outflow temperature (thermodynamical impact), and SST and OHC (ocean impact) in AS 2017 with those during previous extremely active hurricane years (e.g., 2005 and 2010). For each of these quantities, the ranking is calculated at each grid point for the years 1995â€“2017 - the recent period of above-average TC activity

 </sup>. Note that SLP and vertical wind shear and outflow temperature values are ranked in the order of low to high, because lower SLP, weaker wind shear, and lower outflow temperature associated with tropical tropopause cooling facilitate strong TC activity, while the remaining quantities are ranked from high to low, because warmer and higher potential energy conditions (moister and more unstable) are favorable for TC activity. Additionally, standardized SST and OHC anomalies are compared among the three years in a quantitative manner in the middle part of this section.
