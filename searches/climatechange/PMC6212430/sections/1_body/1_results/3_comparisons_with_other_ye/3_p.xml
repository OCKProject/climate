<p id="Par18" class="p">The above results for 2017 are next compared with those that occurred in 2005 and 2010. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref> shows that during 2005, highly favorable thermodynamical conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5e,f</xref>) were widespread across the tropical North Atlantic. This is in contrast to 2017 during which the most favorable conditions were mainly confined to the EMDR. On the other hand, the impact of the ocean during 2017 is comparable to or even stronger than that which occurred in 2005. Specifically, OHC, that can act as a reservoir to keep the ocean surface warm, is substantially higher in ranking during 2017 than in 2005 (cf. Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5b</xref>). A comparison with 2010 (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> (SF3)), reveals that 2017 also had more favorable OHC conditions than that year. However, during 2010, atmospheric conditions (SF
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3c–f</xref>) were more favorable for TC intensification throughout the tropical North Atlantic.
