 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">7</xref>), provide evidence of a strong association between the ocean/atmospheric anomalies and the AMM. Looking at the longer record (1995–2017; see SF

We note that the higher correlation of the ocean/atmospheric anomalies (e.g., SST, SLP, wind shear, humidity, and atmospheric instability) during TC season with the phase/amplitude of the AMM than with either ENSO or the NAO, has been reported in previous studies
