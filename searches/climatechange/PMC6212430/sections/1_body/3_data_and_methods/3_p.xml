 </sup> is applied for the AS months over the period 1982–2017. Specifically, varimax rotation method is applied so that the REOF modes can meet orthogonality to each other. We extract the leading REOF spatial patterns (left panels in Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">2</xref> (SF2)) and corresponding time series (black lines in the right panels in SF2) from the detrended SST anomaly data. The time series (Principal Component time series) present interannual variation of each mode. The time series in blue denote official indices of the ENSO, the AMM, and the NAO archived at NOAA Climate Prediction Center (for ENSO
