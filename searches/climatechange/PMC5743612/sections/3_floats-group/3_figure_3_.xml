 <alt-text class="alt-text">Five maps indicating recent climate (1981–2010), short-term projected climate (2011–2040) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, and long-term projected climate (2041–2070) for RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Chikangunya virus transmission potential (R subscript 0) ranges are less than or equal to 0.5; greater than 0.5 to less than or equal to 0.7; greater than 0.7 to less than or equal to 0.9; greater than 0.9 to less than or equal to 1.0; and greater than 1.0.</alt-text>
