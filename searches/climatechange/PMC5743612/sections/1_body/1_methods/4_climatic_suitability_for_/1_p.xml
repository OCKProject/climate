 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> for each grid cell to produce an overall CHIKV suitability risk category (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). This overall CHIKV suitability risk classification was then assigned to each grid cell in Canada for each of the five climate datasets. ArcGISÂ®10.3 [Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), Inc.] and Panoply 4.5.0 (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) were used to create temporal-spatial risk maps based on the overall CHIKV suitability risk classification.
