<p class="p">Data from a simulation of one regional climate model (RCM) for the time periods 2011–2040 and 2041–2070 were used to explore CHIKV transmission potential under short-term and long-term projected climate change, respectively. The Canadian Regional Climate Model version 5 (CRCM5) (

 <xref rid="c83" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Šeparović et al. 2013</xref>) was selected because this RCM has been extensively evaluated over North America. The CRCM5 has shown to have been substantially improved compared to previous Canadian RCMs in terms of seasonal mean statistics for both temperature and precipitation comparable to other modern RCMs (

With the historical period (1961–2005) simulation, two runs were selected per future time period using the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP, or greenhouse gas emission scenarios) 4.5 and 8.5 (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), these scenarios represent an intermediate and a high greenhouse gas emission scenario, respectively (
