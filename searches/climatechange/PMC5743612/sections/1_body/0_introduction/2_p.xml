<p class="p">CHIKV circulates via two distinct transmission cycles: 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) a sylvatic enzootic cycle transmitted by a wide range of 
 <italic class="italic">Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and among wild primate reservoirs in Africa with occasional spillover to humans; and 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) an urban human–mosquito–human epidemic cycle observed in Asia and the Indian subcontinent (
 <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kendrick et al. 2014</xref>) transmitted by two main vectors, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="c23" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Diallo et al. 1999</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Jupp and McIntosh 1988</xref>). Until recently, the virus was restricted to Africa, Asia, and the Indian subcontinent where sporadic and isolated outbreaks are reported (
 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Burt et al. 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c73" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pialoux et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c81" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rougeron et al. 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Schwartz and Albert 2010</xref>). CHIKV appeared to subside in the 1980s and 1990s only to reemerge in urban outbreaks in Asia and Africa, initiating a large outbreak in 2005–2006 involving millions in the Indian Ocean Islands and southern and central India (

 <xref rid="c48" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kalantri et al. 2006</xref>;

 <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weaver 2014</xref>). The unexpected reemergence of CHIKV in the Indian Ocean region was associated with the mutation of the virus that facilitated virus replication in, and transmission by, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes (
 <xref rid="c85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thiberville et al. 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c88" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tsetsarkin et al. 2007</xref>). Consequently, the mutation supported the geographic expansion of CHIKV into sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe (
 <xref rid="c85" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thiberville et al. 2013</xref>). Autochthonous outbreaks of CHIKV in Europe were first documented in Italy in 2007 (
 <xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rezza et al. 2007</xref>), and in France in 2010 (
 <xref rid="c36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Gould et al. 2010</xref>) and 2014 (
 <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Delisle et al. 2015</xref>). These outbreaks were initiated by infected travelers returning from CHIKV-endemic countries to regions in Europe where 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> is present (
 <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weaver 2014</xref>). More recently, the first cases of autochthonous transmission of CHIKV in the Caribbean were reported in December 2013 on the island of Saint Martin (
 <xref rid="c71" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pan American Health Organization and World Health Organization 2013</xref>). The outbreak has subsequently expanded and is currently ongoing with approximately 1.8 million probable and 65,000 confirmed autochthonous cases reported across 47 countries and territories in the Caribbean, Central America, and South America (
 <xref rid="c70" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pan American Health Organization 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vega-Rúa et al. 2015</xref>). Although the outbreak in the Caribbean is caused by an Asian strain that is thought not to be efficiently transmitted by 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="c63" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Morrison 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weaver 2014</xref>), and the principal vector is likely 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, there is potential for the spread of imported cases by 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="c41" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Higgs and Vanlandingham 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c90" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vega-Rúa et al. 2015</xref>). Associated with the Caribbean outbreak, 11 autochthonous cases of CHIKV were reported in 2014 in Florida where local 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> populations are established (
