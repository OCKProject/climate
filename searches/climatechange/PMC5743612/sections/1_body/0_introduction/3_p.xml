<p class="p">To date, there has been no local transmission of CHIKV in Canada due to the absence (to our knowledge) of reproducing populations of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus</italic>. The cooler Canadian climate is likely a limiting factor for the establishment of these species, particularly 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic>, which is thought to require a tropical or subtropical climate to survive (
 <xref rid="c20" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Christophers 1960</xref>). It may be unlikely that 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> will become established in Canada even if temperatures continue to increase due to climate change (

 <xref rid="c51" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Khormi and Kumar 2014</xref>). However, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> is a cold-tolerant invasive species with the ability to overwinter in a temperate climate (
 <xref rid="c67" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Nicholson et al. 2014</xref>), which raises the possibility of the establishment of this species in southern parts of Canada. Occasional 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitos have been found in southern Ontario, although these are thought to be “adventitious” individuals rather than evidence of reproducing populations (

 <xref rid="c75" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Public Health Ontario 2013</xref>). The species is, however, found in the United States where 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> is thought to be endemic to some southeastern states (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hahn et al. 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c52" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kraemer et al. 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogden et al. 2014</xref>;

 <xref rid="c91" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Waldock et al. 2013</xref>). The rapid rate at which 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> has spread and established across the United States and parts of Africa and Europe suggests that there is potential for this species to become more widely distributed in the United States and perhaps Canada, particularly under projected climate change (
