<p class="p">Our study did identify the potential for parts of southern coastal British Columbia to become progressively suitable for CHIKV transmission under short-term and long-term projected climate, particularly driven by a high emission scenario (RCP8.5). The duration of the transmission season, although short, is expected to expand from 1 month in a very small area in British Columbia in the short-term to 2 months covering a larger area in British Columbia in the long-term. This would be sufficient to sustain short-term autochthonous CHIKV transmission were pathogen and vector to co-occur (

 <italic class="italic">Aedes albopictus</italic> has not been detected in British Columbia although routine surveillance in this province has been sporadic and targeted to 
 <italic class="italic">Culex</italic> spp. vectors of West Nile virus (communication, M. Morshed, May 2017, BCCDC). Our findings suggest that CHIKV and mosquito surveillance in the identified risk areas in British Columbia may be prudent, particularly as

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> becomes more adapted to a cooler environment, the area of risk would expand further north and inland than currently expected and surveillance of the pathogen and vector should also be considered in southern Ontario, Qu√©bec, and the Canadian Prairies. Worth noting is that our study only considered two greenhouse gas emission scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) representing intermediate and high emission scenarios, respectively. Implementation of the recent 2016 Paris Climate Agreement puts Canada on track for the RCP4.5 path, in which case the risk maps for CHIKV transmission under the RCP4.5 scenario would be the most likely projection. Under this scenario, we would expect reduced areas to be suitable for CHIKV transmission and a shorter duration of transmission in southern coastal British Columbia, and much lower risk for the rest of Canada compared to the RCP8.5 scenario. However, if the agreement fails, Canada will be on track for the RCP8.5 path, and the RCP8.5 projections will be the most likely.
