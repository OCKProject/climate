<p class="p">Data quality issues with the climate models used include uncertainty in climate scenarios from one single model and one bias correction approach used to drive the models, and only using data up until 2010. As the risk maps do not incorporate the five most recent years of climate data, the current risks identified is likely an underestimation of the risk given the climate in Canada over the last 5 years has been systematically warmer in the majority of the country compared to previous decades (1980s and 1990s) and climate baseline (

Although the climate data from the bias-corrected models in this study were not far outliers compared to other RCMs and did not deviate significantly from the ensemble mean (see Figure S1), we note that over the summer months the models predicted higher temperatures and drier summers than the ensemble mean. The former is likely to result in a conservative estimate in the risk maps, whereas the latter may result in the under-prediction of the suitability for
