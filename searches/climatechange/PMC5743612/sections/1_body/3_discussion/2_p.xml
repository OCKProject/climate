<p class="p">Our study suggests that Canada is currently not climatically suitable for autochthonous CHIKV transmission. Although we have the climatic suitability for limited CHIKV transmission over the summer period, the long and harsh winters impede survival of mosquito eggs and subsequently the establishment of the two known CHIKV vectors, 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>. The former has a minimum egg survival temperature threshold of

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> is more cold tolerant, it is expected that this species would be the one to realistically have a chance of becoming established in Canada, as has occurred in temperate Europe (

 <xref rid="c78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Rezza et al. 2007</xref>). It is likely that our current winter temperature is below the minimum threshold for either 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> or 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. aegypti</italic> to survive and establish in most parts of Canada, which is a hypothesis consistent with studies on these species globally (

 <xref rid="c57" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Lima et al. 2016</xref>) and reports of 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> along the southern shore of Lake Erie, which is geographically close to areas of southern Ontario (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hahn et al. 2016</xref>), surveillance to rule out their presence may be prudent.
