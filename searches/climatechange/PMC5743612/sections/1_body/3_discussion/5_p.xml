<p class="p">The work presented in this study could have implications for other mosquito-borne pathogens sharing the same vectors as CHIKV. At the time of writing, the outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and the Caribbean was causing concern due to the potential for returning Canadian travelers to spread the disease in the susceptible Canadian population (

With additional data input specific to ZIKV such as the relationship between temperature and the EIP of ZIKV in the vectors, and the duration of the human ZIKV viraemia, the research presented here could be updated rapidly to assess the climatic suitability for autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission in Canada. We do not currently have ZIKV-specific transmission parameters, but given that the epidemiology of ZIKV is similar to CHIKV and dengue, they are transmitted by the same vectors and they appear to co-circulate (

 <xref rid="c13" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Cao-Lormeau and Musso 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Musso and Gubler 2016</xref>), it is likely that Canada is currently not climatically suitable for autochthonous mosquito-borne ZIKV transmission, nor would we expect the risk for transmission to increase significantly with short-term and long-term projected climate. This conclusion is not surprising given ZIKV (and CHIKV) have historically been restricted to tropical and subtropical biomes (

 <xref rid="c93" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Weaver and Lecuit 2015</xref>). This does not preclude autochthonous ZIKV transmission in Canada via secondary transmission routes such as sexual transmission; which was first reported in April 2016 (
 <xref rid="c74" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Public Health Agency of Canada 2016</xref>). Similar to our risk assessment for CHIKV, we cannot rule out other competent ZIKV vectors that may already be established in Canada. Routine surveillance of ZIKV and potential ZIKV vectors should be considered in southern Ontario, Qu√©bec, the Canadian Prairies, and southern coastal British Columbia.
