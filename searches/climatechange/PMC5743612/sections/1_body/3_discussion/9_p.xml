<p class="p">With the data we have at present, the current risk of autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Canada appears to be very low, and risk is restricted to very small parts of Canada under short-term and long-term projected climate. While our findings are not surprising, our study is the first to quantify the risk of CHIKV transmission in Canada which is useful for forming public health policy by identifying the risk of incursion of exotic vector-borne pathogens that are currently endemic to tropical and subtropical regions, into countries at high latitudes with climate change. This study identifies that southern Canada may be the very northern limit for transmission of these pathogens with climate change. Other factors need to be explored however, which include understanding when and where Canadian travelers are likely to return, infrastructure in Canada that may support vector populations in what would be expected to be climatically unsuitable regions, and whether or not there are other competent vectors in Canada. Further research to close the gap on our current understanding of CHIKV and CHIKV vectors, improved surveillance on
