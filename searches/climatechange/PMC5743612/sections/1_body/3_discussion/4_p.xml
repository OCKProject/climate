<p class="p">While our findings are not surprising given the small number of cases of autochthonous transmission of CHIKV in North America, our study is the first to quantify the risk of CHIKV transmission in Canada in terms of when, where, and for how long transmission may occur, which is useful for forming public health policy. Furthermore, this study shows where northern/southern temperature regions will likely be under different climate projections, this is particularly useful for indicating where the borderline for exotic vector-borne pathogens transmitted by
