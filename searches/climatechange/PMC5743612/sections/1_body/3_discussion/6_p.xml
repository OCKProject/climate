<p class="p">There are a number of limitations in this quantitative risk assessment; one of the main assumptions is that climatic conditions can accurately identify suitable habitat for vectors and thus classify risk areas for mosquito-borne diseases. This does not account of the possibility that vectors evolve over time and that changes in their distribution may not be exclusively linked to climatic conditions (
 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Fischer et al. 2014</xref>). Although there are many other factors that contribute to the overall risk, ecological risk is considered a primary driver for where CHIKV transmission may occur and climate-driven species distribution models, including models for 
 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>, have been shown to predict the distribution of mosquitoes and the diseases that they can transmit with acceptable accuracy in a public health context (

 <xref rid="c69" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ogden et al. 2014</xref>). Our study focused on climatic conditions during the warmest months of the year in Canada because they present the highest risk for virus transmission; however, as travel to CHIKV-affected countries by Canadians peak in winter (
 <xref rid="c84" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Statistics Canada 2016</xref>), the risk of viraemic travelers returning to Canada during the summer is lower. The impact of this reduced risk was not explored in this study because we focused on the ecological risk factors essential for CHIKV transmission rather than behavioral factors, but risk for autochthonous CHIKV transmission in Canada is likely influenced by this factor. We also calculated mean monthly temperature (

 </inline-formula> may overestimate the risk for CHIKV transmission. Another limitation is that this study only considers how changes in climate may affect future CHIKV transmission risk in Canada, it does not consider other factors that may influence the future risk such as advances in medicine (development of a CHIKV vaccine or effective treatment for CHIKV), changes in socioeconomic, demographic, and population factors that influence human exposure and changes in human behavior relating to climate change such as spending more time outdoors or indoors. Although future changes in these factors cannot be projected, it is likely they will have an impact on the possibility of CHIKV transmission in Canada in the future.
