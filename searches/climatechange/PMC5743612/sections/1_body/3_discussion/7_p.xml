<p class="p">There are some data quality issues in this study. Data inputs for the CHIKV transmission model were based on very few CHIKV studies to date with some substitution of dengue data for CHIKV given the similarities between the epidemiology of the two viruses, their shared vectors and cocirculation (

 <xref rid="c65" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Musso and Gubler 2016</xref>). There are few field estimates of biting rates and the numbers of mosquitoes per human, and how human behaviors and interventions (mosquito avoidance, mosquito control), infrastructure and environment in Canada (where the majority of Canadians live in an urbanized setting, i.e., air-conditioned homes, lack of stagnant water) affect these is unknown. We also do not have precise information on where Canadian travelers might be returning home from CHIKV-affected countries. However, we used a stochastic model, drawing from a range of probability distributions that were informed by a recent and comprehensive scoping review (S. Garasia et al. unpublished data, 2016) to account for uncertainty in the input parameters. Sensitivity analysis indicate risk maps produced using the 75th percentile
