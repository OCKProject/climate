Under RCP4.5 2011–2040, areas suitable for transmission have expanded across southern Ontario and Québec and into British Columbia. Under RCP4.5 2041–2070, larger areas of southern Ontario, Québec, and British Columbia become suitable for transmission, in addition, parts of southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and western Ontario become suitable for transmission. Under RCP8.5 for both 2011–2040 and 2041–2070, the southern parts of provinces between British Columbia and Québec become suitable for transmission with concentration of suitability expanding significantly in southern Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Québec and western and southern Ontario under long-term projected climate. Additional areas in southern New Brunswick and Nova Scotia become suitable under long-term projected climate. No new high risk areas were identified when compared with maps produced using mean

The time period of possible transmission remains between 2 and 3 months (June to August) under RCP4.5 2011–2040, RCP4.5 2041–2070 and RCP8.5 2011–2040 scenarios but increases to up to 4 months (June to September) under RCP8.5 2041–2070 (see Figure S4).
