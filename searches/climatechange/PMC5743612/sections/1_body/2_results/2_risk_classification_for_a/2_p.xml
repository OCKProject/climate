Under long-term projected climate (2041–2070), for both emission scenarios, an increasingly larger area of southern coastal British Columbia becomes rather suitable and suitable for transmission; these areas are larger and further north along the coast compared to areas identified as suitable for transmission using mean

The duration of climate suitable for potential transmission remains limited to 1–2 months of the year (July–August) (see Figure S6) and no new high risk areas were identified.
