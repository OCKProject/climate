 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic> under recent climate (1981–2010) was very low with all of Canada classified as unsuitable or rather unsuitable for CHIKV transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Under short-term projected climate (2011–2040) for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, a small area of southern coastal British Columbia becomes partly suitable for CHIKV transmission but the rest of Canada remains unsuitable or rather unsuitable for transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). Under long-term projected climate (2041–2070), for both emission scenarios, an increasingly larger area of southern coastal British Columbia becomes rather suitable or suitable for CHIKV transmission (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). However, for these areas the duration of climate suitable for potential transmission is limited to 1–2 months in the year (August under RCP4.5 and July–August under RCP8.5) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). The rest of Canada remains unsuitable or rather unsuitable for CHIKV transmission under long-term projected climate (2041–2070) (

 <italic class="italic">Ae. albopictus</italic>, the current climatic suitability for CHIKV transmission via this vector in southern Ontario and the rest of Canada is very low (
