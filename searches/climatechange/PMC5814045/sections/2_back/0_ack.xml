 <p class="p">The National Climatic Data Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (USA), and the Servicio Meteorol√≥gico Nacional (Mexico) made available, respectively, the SST and air temperature data used in this study. We thank many colleagues and students of several institutions for their effort collecting data for the counts used. The fishermen of Guadalupe, San Benito, and Cedros islands have provided assistance for many years of field work. We heartedly thank them all. We also thank the AE, William J. Etges, for his editorial comments and improvements to the manuscript. The 2004, 2005, 2010, 2015 and 2016 counts were collected for the authors with official permission of Mexican agencies (SGPA/DGVS/10857, 11815, 04188/09, 00340/10, 00195/15, and 00050/16).</p>
