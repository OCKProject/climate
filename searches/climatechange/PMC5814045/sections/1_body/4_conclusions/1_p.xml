<p class="p">The results obtained in this study suggest that numbers of northern elephant seals in Baja California colonies are decreasing, and the climate in the region is warming. Since population sizes in the Channel Islands of southern California are increasing [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], we propose that these seals may not be migrating as far south as in previous years, probably in response to the observed temperature increases. Current climate projections predict that the SST and air temperatures will continue to warm during the 21st century, with the strongest warming projected for the tropical and subtropical regions of the Northern Hemisphere [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Under these environment scenarios, it is possible that the Baja California colonies will continue to decrease in the future, while the Channel Islands colonies will continue to grow. Further research on the dispersal of northern elephant seals is necessary to confirm this change using, for example, tagged animals. Our results also imply that the colonies of Baja California and California are not demographically isolated, as previously suggested [
