<p class="p">We hypothesize that the elephant seal population of Baja California is experiencing a decline because the animals are not migrating as far south due to warming sea and air temperatures. In this paper, we assessed the status of Baja California colonies using counts of either live pups or adult females since 1965 at the three major sites, i.e., Guadalupe, San Benito, and Cedros, and analysed the climatic trends using sea surface temperature (SST) data spanning the last 120 years for the waters that surrounding the breeding range of the northern elephant seal. The SST was used as a climate indicator because of its direct influence on the lower atmosphere, and hence on local weather and climate [
