<p class="p">The effects of the decline in sea-ice on the abundance and demographic parameters of ice-associated pinnipeds had been well documented for some species, such as the Pacific walrus (

 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], but climate change impacts on land-breeding pinnipeds is less well known. It has been suggested that a reduction in sea-ice could result in an increase in available coastal habitats of these species, allowing them to extend their distribution ranges toward the poles [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. Alternately, the expected warmer climates could limit both range expansion and population growth because elevated air temperatures produce thermal stress and increase pup mortality [
