<p class="p">Records of air temperature taken at Cedros Island during the period 1957–1995 were obtained from the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (SMN) dataset, freely available at the Comisión Nacional del Agua (CONAGUA) web page. Data were recorded at SMN station 2027 (28°5’50″N, 115°11’12″W, elevation 10m). The datasets consist of daily maximum, minimum, and mean air temperature values. These data were used to estimate monthly values that were in turn averaged to obtain seasonal and annual estimates for air temperatures. Seasons were defined using the standard meteorological definition: winter = December, January and February; spring = March, April and May; summer = June, July and August, and autumn = September, October and November.</p>
