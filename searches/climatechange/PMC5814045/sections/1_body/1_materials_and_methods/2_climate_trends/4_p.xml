<p class="p">Air temperature trends were also determined using the MK test to assess the probability that a trend exists in the data that is statistically different from zero, and to evaluate its increasing or decreasing slope [

Even though the time series has data gaps, the analysis can be performed because the MK test allows for missing data by appropriately reducing the value of the sample size. When a significant trend (P &lt; 0.05) in the air temperature was detected, the magnitude of the slope (

Finally, we examined the number of heat waves during winter and early spring (i. e., from December to April), which corresponds to the birth season and the post-weaning fast, respectively. A heat wave was defined as a single day with an average maximum temperature ≥ 25.1°C. This temperature value was used as a threshold because it was determined as the upper critical air temperature for harbour seal (
