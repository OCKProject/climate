<p class="p">We used monthly SST data for the Pacific Ocean basin, spanning the period January 1897 through December 2016, from the Extended Reconstruction Sea Surface Temperature Version 3b (ERSSTv3b). This version of the database has data available through 2016 [

 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>] with a cutoff period of 1.2 yr was applied to the data to remove the semi-annual and annual cycles. Rotated empirical orthogonal functions (REOF) were then calculated for the entire Pacific Ocean basin from the filtered and detrended data to isolate the El Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) signal. Rotation of the empirical orthogonal functions was done following the varimax method [
