<p class="p">We used the number of pups produced to estimate both population trends and size since this is the best way to reduce bias in the assessment [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>]. We compiled direct counts of live pups (suckling and weaners) conducted at the end of the birthing season in February, where we assumed the number of pups counted was equal to the number of pups produced (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0193211.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Since pups remain on land until ~2.5 months old, we assumed that all living pups were detected. However, because counts were carried out at the end of the birthing season, it is likely that some pups had died before the count, and therefore the total pup production could be slightly underestimated. For the Baja California population, the mortality rate between birth and weaning has been estimated for a single colony (San Benito), and only for two seasons in the early 2000s [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. We decided not to use that information to try to estimate pup production because this rate can vary annually and locally.
