<p class="p">In some years, no pup counts were carried out on Guadalupe and San Benito islands, but direct counts of females were conducted in January. The number of pups produced was estimated based on these counts (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0193211.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>) taking into account the temporal distribution of females on land together with the birth rate (
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>). Female elephant seals are asynchronous [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>], but their temporal distribution on land remains consistent from year to year [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Female temporal distributions were described for the San Benito colony [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] using the Rothery and McCann model (RMM) [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]. Thus, we calculated the total number of females that arrived at each colony during the whole breeding season as the number of females counted divided by the expected proportion of females on land at the count date, obtained based on the RMM. The number of pups produced was estimated by multiplying the total number of females by 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic>, estimated at 74.19 ± 3.45% for the San Benito colony during the period 2002–2016 [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. It is important to note that both the expected proportion of females on land and 
 <italic class="italic">B</italic> were calculated for the San Benito colony, but were used to estimate the pup production in Guadalupe (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0193211.t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). This could represent a source of error since these values could vary locally; however, this was the only way to estimate the pup production with the available data.
