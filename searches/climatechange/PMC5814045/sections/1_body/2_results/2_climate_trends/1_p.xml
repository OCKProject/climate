<p class="p">As expected, the dominant mode of variability of the filtered and detrended SST data in the Pacific Ocean was due to the ENSO phenomenon (REOF mode 1, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0193211.g003" class="xref">Fig 3a</xref>). The expansion coefficients, i.e. the time varying component, of the first mode of our REOF analysis were highly correlated (r = 0.94) with the Multivariate ENSO Index [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>], the mode accounted for 55% of the total variance of the SST fields. For any given ENSO event of either sign, the region experienced SST anomalies that are in phase with the equatorial Pacific Ocean and have magnitudes that were roughly half of those that occur at the epicenter of the phenomenon in the ocean near Per√∫ and Ecuador.
