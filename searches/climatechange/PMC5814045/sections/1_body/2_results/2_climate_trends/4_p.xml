<p class="p">The average annual air temperature for the study period (1957–1995) was 19.8 ± 3.0°C (range: -1.1, 40.2°C). The MK test revealed positive and significant trends in both the annual and seasonal time series of the mean and minimum air temperatures. The maximum temperatures had positive but not significant trends (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0193211.t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, over the period, minimum air temperatures increased at a higher rate than the maximum temperatures. The maximum positive trends of the mean temperature were detected during summer (0.10°C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>) and autumn (0.12°C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>), but the highest rate of increase of the minimum air temperature was found in the autumn and winter time series (both at 0.15°C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>). The annual mean temperature increased at a rate of 0.09°C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, whereas the minimum temperature increased by 0.12°C yr
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> (
