<p class="p">The signal of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) was not isolated in a single mode by our REOF analysis, as was the case with ENSO and the first mode. Rather, decadal variability in our REOF decomposition was spread out between modes 1 and 2; their expansion coefficients correlated with the widely used monthly PDO index [

Correlation of the expansion coefficients of all other modes with the PDO index is significantly smaller. Therefore, decadal variability related to the PDO phenomenon was only partially removed with the subtraction of REOF mode 1 prior to the calculation of the SST trends presented in
