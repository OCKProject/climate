<p class="p">Our SST analysis shows that the surface waters off Baja California have warmed during the last three decades. The recent strong SST warming trend of the habitat off Baja California of the northern elephant seal is in sharp contrast to the weak cooling that occurred in that region throughout most of the 20th century. The region of the Pacific Ocean that is adjacent to the Baja California peninsula is directly affected by ENSO events, and positive El Niño associated ENSO events must therefore constitute a source of significant thermal stress for northern elephant seals. The PDO was in its negative phase throughout most of the period 1987–2016 and its spatial structure is similar to the ENSO mode in that its negative phase implies a cooling effect in the region of interest [
