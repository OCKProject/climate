<p class="p">During the early 21st century, the number of northern elephant seals using Baja California islands is decreasing because the two major colonies of Guadalupe and San Benito have experienced population declines, whereas the Cedros colony seems to have stabilized. For 2009, the abundance in Baja California was estimated to be ca. 22,000 individuals. Adding that to the abundance estimated for California in 2010 [
 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], the total population size of the northern elephant seal at the end of the 2000s would be roughly about 201,000 individuals. Since the numbers in Baja California are declining, and the numbers in California are increasing, the contribution of the Baja California colonies in terms of the number of births decreased from 25% in the early 1990s [
