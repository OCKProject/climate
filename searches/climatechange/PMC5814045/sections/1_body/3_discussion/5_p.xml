 <sup class="sup">-1</sup> for the period 1957–1995, and this warming was mainly caused by the increment in minimum air temperatures. Unfortunately, the lack of recent data makes it impossible to confirm if this trend in air temperature has persisted over the past 20 years. However, it is likely due to the close relationship between SST and air temperature in the study areas. Alternately, heat waves, as defined in this study, are not unusual events in the region, and their frequency during winter and spring has increased since the late 1970s. These events could potentially produce hyperthermia, and are especially dangerous during the birthing season and the post-weaning fast because pups have diminished heat tolerance due to their high mass-specific metabolism [
