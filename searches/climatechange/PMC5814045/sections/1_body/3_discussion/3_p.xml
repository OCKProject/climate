 <xref rid="pone.0193211.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], we propose that the population declines of the Baja California colonies are related to observed climatic change. For land pinnipeds, heat is an environmental threat because of metabolic rate increases and risk of hyperthermia or heat stroke [

Northern elephant seals are physiologically well adapted to the cold-waters of the North Pacific, but heat dissipation could be a problem when they are on their temperate and subtropical breeding areas. Like other phocids, they cannot pant and do not have sweat glands, and heat is dissipated through thermal windows [
