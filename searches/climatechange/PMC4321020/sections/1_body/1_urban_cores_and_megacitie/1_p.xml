<p class="p">Many of the current large urban areas in the tropics are undergoing relatively unchecked growth, with population increases well outpacing improvements in infrastructure. Megacities, such as Dhaka or Jakarta as well as megacities-in-waiting, such as Kinshasa, are overwhelmed with a seemingly unending array of public-health threats.

 </sup> Pollution, a major driver of respiratory-related diseases, will almost surely become a larger problem with further urbanization and increasing temperature.
