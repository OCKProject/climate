<p class="p">Chronic diseases such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases are constant threats within urban cores that are strongly influenced by increases in temperature.

 </sup> Their contribution to disease-induced deaths will likely increase during the hotter months of the year. The seasonality of many infectious diseases are also strongly linked to climatic drivers, but no single climatic driver affects all infectious diseases in the same way. Shigella bacteria favor moderate temperatures, so shigella-related deaths would increase in places that are now colder.

 </sup> Conversely, warmer temperatures tend to favor both mosquitoes and the pathogens they transmit, but only up to a point. Though the burden of dengue is increasing, it remains unclear whether this is primarily the result of urbanization or climate change. Malaria, on the other hand, tends to decline with urbanization

 </sup> Co-infection and comorbidity, both of which are a major threat in urban cores, will alter the overall disease-related death rates in ways that are difficult to predict and likely not universal across all large cities within the tropics.
