<p class="p">The timing and magnitude of seasonal patterns in all-cause mortality is, of course, driven at any given location by the particular local mix of causes of death, and their individual seasonal characteristics. This further complicates predictions of the impact of changing climate and urbanization. Even if the likely effects on major causes of death could be predicted, their co-distributions, interactions and overall impact on mortality, and seasonality of mortality, would vary geographically. This is made yet more complex by the fact that both urbanization and climate change may alter ranges or occurrence rates of both infectious and chronic diseases.
