<p class="p">The HOSUT line expressing a sucrose transporter is potentially enhanced in sucrose transport and shows a superior performance for many yield-related traits compared with Certo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Our results reveal that both HOSUT and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment similarly improve a wide range of phenotypic and yield-related traits although associated with lower grain quality. Responses to elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> are more pronounced for Certo and less effective for HOSUT. This suggests that HOSUT is already optimized and may benefit only weakly from any future CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> increase. The fact that HOSUT cannot use additional C from source stimulation as efficiently as Certo points to other rate-limiting factors for grain filling, such as short-distance transport at the spike level. Obviously the improved sink strength of HOSUT diminishes a positive CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effect on grain yield. While both factors, HOSUT and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, diminish grain protein concentration, HOSUT benefits more strongly from high N fertilization with respect to grain yield, grain number per plant, and ear biomass. This might point to a basic improvement in assimilate transfer, especially to grains. Relatively high N fertilization is necessary to develop the HOSUT yield advantage. Application of a moderate heat wave at early grain filling considerably diminishes grain size, yield, and starch concentration without apparent interaction with line or CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects.
