 </xref>). Higher thousand grain weight (TGW), grain width, and length pointed to increased individual grain sink strength and improved sucrose partitioning at the whole-plant level. The observed increase in individual grain size was somewhat compensated by lower grain numbers per spike. In addition, there was a trend towards lower grain protein concentrations. Finally, it was concluded that increased seed size and ear number per plant mostly contributed to the higher grain yield (
