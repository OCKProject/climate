<p class="p">The HOSUT lines are suitable models to better understand determinants of grain size and number, its relationship to grain sink strength, and the potential limitations of wheat yield potential. This study is based on existing data on three different wheat lines ectopically expressing a sucrose transporter. While yield advantages of these lines compared with the wild type have already been reported (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saalbach 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>), the lines have never been grown under varying assimilate source strength. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment means a potential increase in assimilate source strength both via increasing non-structural carbohydrate pools in the stems to be mobilized during grain filling and by stimulating flag leaf photosynthesis. At the same time, indirect effects of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment such as extreme climatic events may counteract this CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> fertilization effect. As a third variable, N supply has to be taken into account since high N supply may possibly alleviate the trade-off between grain yield and grain protein concentration. Here, we wanted to analyse the combinatorial effects and interactions of elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, a heat wave applied during grain filling, and variation in N fertilization on growth and yield-related parameters of the HOSUT line as compared with the non-transgenic line Certo. The aim of this work was to test the hypothesis that the HOSUT line with improved sink strength can benefit more from source stimulation by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment compared with the wild-type control. Data on plant phenology, yield-related traits, grain dimensions, and composition were collected and investigated using a full four-factorial analysis.
