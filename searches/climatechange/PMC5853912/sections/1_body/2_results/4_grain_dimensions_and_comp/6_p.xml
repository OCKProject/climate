<p class="p">The analysis of the storage proteins in mature grains showed that HOSUT manifested decreased crude protein, extractable proteins, gluten, and gliadins by 5–8% compared with Certo. Albumins/globulins, total glutenins, and low molecular weight glutenin subunits γ- and ωb-gliadins were not significantly different between the lines. Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> decreased all protein classes by 10–14%, except albumins/globulins and ωb-gliadins. High N fertilization increased the concentration of all protein fractions and types by &gt;10%, except albumins/globulins. When grown under the heat wave, mature grains exhibited increased concentrations of all proteins by 11–20%, except ωb-gliadins (
