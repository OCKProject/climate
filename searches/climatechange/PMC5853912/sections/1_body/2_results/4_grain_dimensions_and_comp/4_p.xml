<p class="p">The analysis of microelements in mature grains revealed that HOSUT did not differ greatly from the wild type with respect to grain nutrient element concentrations. Significant line differences were found only for Zn, with higher, and for K, with lower values in HOSUT grains. In contrast, CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment strongly decreased all elements, except Mo. High N fertilization increased S, Mo, and Ca. The heat wave treatment during early grain development increased the concentrations of all elements, except Mo, which was probably due to combined effects of reduced grain weight and lower starch concentration (
