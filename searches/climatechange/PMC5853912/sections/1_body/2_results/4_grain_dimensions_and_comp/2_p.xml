<p class="p">Starch concentration was higher and grain N percentages were lower in grains of HOSUT compared with Certo. However, total N yield was superior for HOSUT, probably due to its higher TGW and ear number, which possibly more than compensated the lower grain N concentration. Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment increased grain starch, but decreased grain N concentration. High N fertilization increased grain starch and N concentration as well as total N yield of grains. The heat wave treatment decreased grain starch, but increased grain N concentration. Grain sucrose concentration was lower at high N fertilization. The heat wave application strongly increased grain sucrose concentration, possibly due to impaired sucrose to starch conversion (
