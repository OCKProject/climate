<p class="p">Several treatment interactions were detected for grain composition traits. Grain starch showed a strong increase at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> in HOSUT, but no significant response in Certo. The grain N concentration showed a strong positive response to additional N supply in Certo but much less so in HOSUT. For total N yield, an interactive response existed between line and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment. At ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, N yield was much higher in HOSUT than in Certo, but this advantage was lost at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. N supply and line had interactive effects on grain sucrose concentration which decreased in HOSUT grains but not in Certo grains when additional N was supplied. Grain sucrose levels were also affected differently by CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment and N fertilization. At elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, sucrose remained low at both N fertilization levels, but was significantly higher at ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and normal N fertilization (
