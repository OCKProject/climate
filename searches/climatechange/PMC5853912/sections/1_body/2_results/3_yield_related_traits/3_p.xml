<p class="p">Water supply (i.e. the cumulative amount of water provided to the pots to keep plants well watered) did not differ between lines, was lower at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, higher at high N supply, and lower for plants grown with the heat wave. With respect to WUE, HOSUT performed better than Certo. Elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> strongly increased WUE whereas WUE remained unchanged due to high N supply or the heat wave application (
