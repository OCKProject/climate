There were also a line×N fertilization interaction for these traits since there was a clear increase in grain yield and grain number per pot at high N supply for HOSUT but not for Certo. For harvest index, a line×N fertilization interaction occurred with a slight increase for HOSUT at high N supply but a strong decrease for Certo (
