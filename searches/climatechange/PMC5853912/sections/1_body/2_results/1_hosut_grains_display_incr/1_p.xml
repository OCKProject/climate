 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2B</xref>), which indicated a possible assimilate effect on endosperm cell proliferation and might have increased mature grain size of the HOSUT plants (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2C</xref>). Reduced cell number in HOSUT endosperm at 30 d after fertilization could be due to earlier maturation coupled with endosperm cell death (
