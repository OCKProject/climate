<p class="p">The flowering start date for Certo was 92.5 d after planting under ambient CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> conditions and 91 d after planting under elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>. Thus elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> led to earlier flowering of Certo by 1.5 d (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.0001). The flowering start date for HOSUT, under both ambient and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, was 90 d after planting, indicating that in contrast to Certo the high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment did not shift the start of flowering of HOSUT. Furthermore, HOSUT under ambient and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> started flowering 2.5 d and 1 d earlier than Certo, respectively (
 <italic class="italic">P</italic>&lt;0.0001).
