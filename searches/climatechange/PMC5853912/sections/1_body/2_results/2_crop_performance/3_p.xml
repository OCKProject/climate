<p class="p">HOSUT and Certo interacted significantly differently with CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment for the traits stem, ear, and aboveground biomass. Under high CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> conditions, there was a stronger stimulatory response for Certo compared with HOSUT. A line effect was also visible for N fertilization, revealing that for the trait ear biomass, high N fertilization was stimulatory for HOSUT only and not for Certo (
