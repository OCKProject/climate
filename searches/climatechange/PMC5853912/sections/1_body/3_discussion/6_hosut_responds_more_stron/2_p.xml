<p class="p">The heat wave at early grain filling decreased aboveground and ear biomass, grain yield, harvest index, grain size parameters, water use, and grain starch concentration, and at the same time increased grain sucrose concentration, but did not alter N yield for both HOSUT and Certo. Even a moderate heat wave during early grain development, which is quite common in spring or early summer in Western Europe, strongly affected grain developmental parameters, which finally decreased yield by ~15%. The heat wave strongly affected starch biosynthesis and/or conversion of sucrose to starch, which is reflected by an increased sucrose to starch ratio in the grains (
