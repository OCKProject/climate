<p class="p">Both factors, intrinsic HOSUT traits and CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, positively affected phenological and yield-related traits in a similar manner, as was shown for canopy height, biomass of stems and ears, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, ears per plant, TGW, grain starch concentration, and WUE. However, the two factors differ in their mode of action. While CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment frequently stimulates biomass accumulation by improving C assimilation and thereby increasing source strength, the HOSUT transgene potentially fuels sucrose transport and partitioning mainly in grains and young sink tissues, and thus increases sink strength.
