<p class="p">Grain nutrient element concentrations were in general lower at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, but were not lower (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>) or were even increased in HOSUT grains compared with Certo (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saalbach 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Thus, the effects of gene expression in the HOSUT line improved grain nutrient element concentration relative to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment. Possibly, amended transport and/or allocation could play a role because it has been suggested that feed-forward control of microelement loading is regulated by sucrose flux into the endosperm and therefore may respond to increased grain sink strength of the HOSUT line (
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stomph 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>). The transfer route of nutrient elements into grains resembles that of sucrose (
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Pearson 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1998
 </xref>). Higher Zn contents, as seen in the HOSUT grains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), might be due to improved sucrose uptake capacities, supporting the suggestion that grain sink strength is important for micronutrient delivery (
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Stomph 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2011
 </xref>). Another factor could be a possibly increased mass flow due to HOSUT effects. A relationship between transpiration and nutrient acquisition has been suggested (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">McGrath and Lobell, 2013</xref>), showing that higher mass flow occurs upon increased water use/transpiration, which could improve nutrient acquisition. Since mineral element depletion in grains due to increasing atmospheric CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentrations might represent a threat to human nutrition in the future (
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">HÃ¶gy and Fangmeier, 2008</xref>; 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Myers 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>), this trait of HOSUT should be considered when dealing with hidden hunger problems.
