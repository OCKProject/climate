<p class="p">While for some phenotypic changes, HOSUT effects mimicked those of CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, clear differences accounted for others. Tiller number was increased due to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, but was decreased in HOSUT compared with Certo. Nevertheless, ear number per plant was increased by both treatments. This confirms that elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> and HOSUT effects at least partially function in a different context.
