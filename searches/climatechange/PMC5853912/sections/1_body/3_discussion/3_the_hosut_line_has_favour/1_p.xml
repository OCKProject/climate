<p class="p">The 
 <italic class="italic">HvSUT1</italic> transgene is expressed in developing caryopses but, somewhat unexpectedly, also in other tissues, preferentially in young vegetative sink organs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). It was shown earlier that the 
 <italic class="italic">Hordein B1</italic> promoter controls a seed storage protein gene in the endosperm (
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Marris 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 1988
 </xref>). However, promoters across different cereals may change their tissue specificity (
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Furtado 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2009
 </xref>), indicating that the barley 
 <italic class="italic">Hordein B1</italic> promoter in wheat is not solely grain specific, and altered sucrose transport potential and partitioning can be anticipated in other organs as well. This may explain the changed performance of HOSUT with respect to lower tiller numbers, higher number of ears per pot, and higher aboveground biomass. If the transgene is already active in young organs, this might lead to more ears. Later on, the high grain sink strength could lead to an earlier senescence of existing tillers, which would reduce the number of existing tillers at maturity.
