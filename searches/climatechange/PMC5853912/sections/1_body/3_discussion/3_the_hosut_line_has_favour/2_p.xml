<p class="p">While flowering time was accelerated only in Certo by elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, HOSUT plants flowered earlier under both ambient and elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> concentration compared with Certo. Sucrose is important to stimulate flowering induction and, accordingly, changed expression of sucrose transporters alters flowering time, indicating that sucrose translocation and distribution are critical (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2" class="xref">Fig. 2A</xref>). Thus, sucrose effects within the apex can be expected such as stimulation of cell proliferation resulting in general acceleration of development. Subsequently, this promotes flowering time in HOSUT plants, but without further acceleration by CO
