<p class="p">HOSUT and Certo responded significantly differently to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> treatment with respect to biomass of stems and ears, total aboveground biomass, grain yield, N yield, and grains per plant. For both HOSUT and Certo, all these traits reacted positively to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment. However, the response was significantly more pronounced for Certo. CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment was less effective in HOSUT, indicating that it is already optimized according to assimilate translocation to grains. Thus, while Certo could be strongly promoted by elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, generating additional sinks such as stems and ears, HOSUT was more saturated and responded only weakly. The fact that HOSUT did not strongly react directs attention to other factors, which may be limiting for grain filling in wheat. While sucrose transporters could affect assimilate loading and unloading, other limiting factors can be critical such as development of the vascular system and/or short-distance transport within the spike, rachis, and spikelet.
