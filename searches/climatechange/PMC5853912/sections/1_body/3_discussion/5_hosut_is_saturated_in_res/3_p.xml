<p class="p">The line responses to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment revealed that increased starch levels at elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> occurred only for HOSUT but not for Certo (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6" class="xref">Fig. 6B</xref>). Thus, grain starch of HOSUT responded more strongly to CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> than Certo, indicating again that translocation processes/grain sink strength are more optimized in HOSUT compared with Certo. Subsequently, the additional C provided from CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment could be more efficiently used, especially in the grains.
