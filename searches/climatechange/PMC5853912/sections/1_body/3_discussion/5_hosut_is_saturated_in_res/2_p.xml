<p class="p">Higher individual grain sink strength in HOSUT is accompanied by lower grain number per spike, a trait which strongly depends on assimilates allocated to the spike (
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ghiglione 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2008
 </xref>). A negative relationship between grain size and grain number per spike has been observed earlier for HOSUT (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saalbach 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>) and could indicate limited assimilate supply/transport at the spike level. Accordingly, we conclude that higher individual grain sink strength cannot be fully balanced by assimilate transport into HOSUT ears.
