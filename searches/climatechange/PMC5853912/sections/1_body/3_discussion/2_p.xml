<p class="p">While in HOSUT plants sink activity has been increased, elevated CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> signifies increased source activity, which in many plants stimulates photosynthesis and regularly induces faster growth and biomass accumulation (

 <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment can be better used by HOSUT. In parallel, the effects of a heat wave during early grain development and influences from high N fertilization were analysed.
