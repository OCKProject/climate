<p class="p">Optimizing assimilate partitioning to the spike and increasing harvest index are of high priority for improving the yield potential of wheat (

  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>). Thus, HOSUT plants are models with improved assimilate supply to grains, leading to higher grain yield.
