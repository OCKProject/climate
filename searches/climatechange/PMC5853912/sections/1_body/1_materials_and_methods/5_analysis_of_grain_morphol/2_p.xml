<p class="p">Macro- and microelements in mature grains were measured by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES, iCAP 6000, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) combined with the CETAC ASXPRESS™ 
 <italic class="italic">PLUS</italic> rapid sample introduction system, and a CETAC autosampler (CETAC Technologies, Omaha, NE, USA). A 50 mg aliquot of dried and ground samples was digested with 2 ml of 69% nitric acid (HNO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>) (Bernd Kraft GmbH, Germany) using the high performance microwave reactor UltraClave IV from MLS GmbH (Germany). Digested samples were filled up to 15 ml final volume with deionized water from the Milli-Q
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Reference System, Merck (Germany). Element standards (Bernd Kraft multi-element standard solution, Germany) Mo, Na, Mg, P, S, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, and K were used as external standards, and Yttrium (ICP Standard Certipur
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Merck Germany) was used as an internal standard for matrix correction.
