<p class="p">Wheat plants were grown in greenhouses (
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Saalbach 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2014
 </xref>), and total RNA was extracted using material of three biological replicates (
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Staroske 
  <italic class="italic">et al.</italic>, 2016
 </xref>). First-strand cDNA was synthesized with an oligo(dT) primer and SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). qRT-PCR was performed using Power Sybr
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> Green PCR Mastermix, with 25 ng of amplified cDNA in each PCR. Using the HvSUT1-specific primers: forward, 5'-CGG GCG GTC GCA GCT CGC GTC TAT T-3'; and reverse, 5'-CAT ACA GTG ACT CTG ACC GGC ACA CA-3', qRT-PCR was performed with an ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems), with 2 min at 50 °C, 40 cycles of 10 min at 95 °C, 15 s at 95 °C, and 1 min at 60 °C following a dissociation stage of 15 s at 95 °C, 15 s at 60 °C, and 15 s at 95 °C. Amplification efficiency was assessed with the LinRegPCR program. The wheat 
 <italic class="italic">actin</italic> gene (accession no. AB181991) was used for normalization; 
 <italic class="italic">actin</italic> primers were forward, 5'-GTG GAG GTT CTA CCA TGT TTC CTG-3'; and reverse, 5'-GCT AAG AGA GGC CAA AAT AGA GCC-3'.
