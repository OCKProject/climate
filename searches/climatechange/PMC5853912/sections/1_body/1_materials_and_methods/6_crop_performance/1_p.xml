The final harvest was performed when at least 50% of all pots per treatment reached full maturity (DC89). Canopy height as well as tiller and ear number per pot were measured at maturity. Aboveground biomass of wheat plants was harvested and separated into leaves, stems, and ears. Vegetative and generative biomass fractions were oven-dried at 60 °C and 30 °C, respectively. The dry weight of all biomass fractions was determined until they reached constant weight. After careful threshing to retain all grains, the harvest index, grain number per pot, and grain number per ear were estimated. Total water supply per pot was registered until final harvest, and related to aboveground biomass in order to calculate the WUE.
