<p class="p">Two wheat plants were grown in one pot (10 cm diameter, 40 cm height; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1A</xref>) using substrate mixed from standard soil (Fruhstorfer Erde LD 80, HAWITA Group GmbH, Vechta, Germany) with washed river sand (Ø 0.3–2 mm) 1:2 (v:v), which resulted in an N supply of 200 kg ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>. Exposure in the climate chambers was performed at ambient (380 ppm) and elevated (550 ppm) CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>, in combination with normal (200 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) and increased N (300 kg N ha
 <sup class="sup">–1</sup>) by adding nutrient solution using calcium nitrate tetrahydrate, under both standard climate and application of a heat wave. The heat wave was modulated with respect to duration and daytime air temperature and humidity according to typical conditions in Western Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1" class="xref">Fig. 1B</xref>). The heat wave started 2 days after flowering (DAF) until 11 DAF, covering early grain development. Total water supply per pot was registered until final harvest, with watering performed at least every day. Potential water loss due to drainage was prevented by supplying each pot with a saucer and pouring drainage water back into the respective pot when necessary. Evaporation from the pots’ soil surface was not taken into account since we were interested in agronomic water use efficiency (WUE), which was calculated by relating water supply to aboveground biomass.
