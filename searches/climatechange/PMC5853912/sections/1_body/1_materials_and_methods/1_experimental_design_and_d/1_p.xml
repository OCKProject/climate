<p class="p">A full factorial experiment was performed under controlled conditions in phytochambers with four factors, each with two levels. The factors were: (i) winter wheat (

 </xref> (1). The design resulted in 16 treatment combinations, which were each tested with six replicates (96 samples in total); one repetition consisted of one pot with two plants each. The experiment allowed study of the effect of each factor on response variables related to plant phenology, yield-related traits, grain dimensions, and grain composition. Additionally, effects of interactions between factors on response variables were determined. The results were analysed by four-way ANOVA using OriginPro 8.1 software (
