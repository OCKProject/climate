  <p class="p">Wheat plants of Certo and HOSUT around the flowering stage as grown in the</p>
  <p class="p">climate chambers; note developmental differences between Certo and HOSUT. (B) Heat wave temperature profile modulated with respect to duration, daytime temperature, and vapour pressure deficit according to typical conditions in Southern Germany. The heat wave started 2 days after flowering (DAF) until 11 DAF, covering early grain development. The grey shaded area depicts the dark period. (This figure is available in colour at
