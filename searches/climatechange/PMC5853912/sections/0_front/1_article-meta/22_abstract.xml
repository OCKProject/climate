 <p class="p">Crop yield stability must be ensured under future climate conditions such as elevated CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> and high temperatures. We tested ‘HOSUT’, a winter wheat line expressing a grain-targeted sucrose transporter of barley in response to combinations of CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, a heat wave, and high nitrogen fertilization. Compared with wild-type Certo, HOSUT had a superior performance for grain yield, aboveground biomass, and ears per plant, obviously due to transgene activity in developing grains and young vegetative sinks. HOSUT grains were larger and contained more endosperm cells. HOSUT and high CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> effects similarly improved phenological and yield-related traits. Significant HOSUT–CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> interactions for biomass of stems, ears, grain yield, nitrogen yield, and grain number revealed that Certo was promoted by CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, whereas HOSUT responded weakly. CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment strongly reduced and HOSUT effects weakly reduced grain nitrogen, storage proteins, and free amino acids. In contrast to CO
  <sub class="sub">2</sub> enrichment, HOSUT effects did not impair grain micronutrient concentrations. Significant HOSUT–nitrogen fertilization interactions for ear biomass, grain yield, grain number per plant, and harvest index indicated that HOSUT benefited more from additional nitrogen. The heat wave decreased aboveground and ear biomass, grain yield, harvest index, grain size, and starch and water use, but increased grain sucrose concentration.
