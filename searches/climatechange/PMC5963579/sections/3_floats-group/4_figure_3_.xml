  <p class="p">Average monthly number of (
   <italic class="italic">A</italic>) salmonellosis cases, (
   <italic class="italic">B</italic>) mean temperature, and (
   <italic class="italic">C</italic>) rainfall in Central Queensland between 2004 and 2013. Salmonellosis cases were sourced from Queensland Health’s Communicable Disease database (Queensland Health, written communication, 2015), adjusted for under-reporting, nonfoodborne cases, and cases not acquired locally, and averaged for each month. Weather data were sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BOM, personal communication, 2014) for individual weather stations in Central Queensland. We calculated the mean regional temperature and rainfall by averaging the daily data from the individual stations and then calculated the mean monthly temperature and rainfall for the region over the 2004–2013 period by averaging the daily data over the months.
