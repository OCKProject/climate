  <p class="p">Microsimulation model for salmonellosis. Disability weights [0.0 to 1.0, the proportion of a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) “lost” during each state] and average time spent in the health state are in each state’s box, and the overall probability of transitioning between health states is shown along the pathway. Overall probabilities are presented as an example; however, the probabilities in the model varied by age and sex. The dashed arrow represents the difference in the probability of transitioning from “healthy” to “salmonellosis” under the climate change scenario compared with the baseline (no climate change) scenario, that is to say, the influence of the projected change in daily temperatures and rainfall on the incidence of salmonellosis during 2016–2036. The sources of utility weights (from which disability weights were derived by subtracting the utility weight from 1), durations, and transition probabilities are shown in Table 1. The probabilities of dying or emigrating varied substantially by age and sex and therefore have been denoted here as “by age and sex” rather than an overall value.</p>
