<p class="p">The proportions of estimated costs of salmonellosis accounted for by sex and age groups were similar for the baseline and climate change scenarios because climate change did not influence these characteristics, and differences between the simulated populations were therefore due to random variation only (data not shown). The estimated costs of salmonellosis and its sequelae for females were approximately twice the estimated costs for males, with females incurring 66.3% of the total costs owing to their increased rate of sequelae conditions (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t4" class="xref">Table 4</xref>). Estimated costs were highest for younger age groups (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5" class="xref">Table 5</xref>) owing to the higher incidence of acute salmonellosis in this group (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>), with children 0–9 y old accounting for 34% of the total costs. Individuals 30–39 y old and 20–29 y old had the next highest estimated costs, consistent with the relatively high rate of PI-IBS in these age groups (
