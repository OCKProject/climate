<p class="p">Averaging the weather projections data somewhat tempered projections of extremes; however, substantial variation in weather was still observed in the data. For example, mean daily temperatures ranged between 15.3°C and 28.9°C. Central Queensland was projected to experience a 1.8% increase in annual mean temperature and a 3.5% decrease in annual rainfall by 2036 under the A1FI scenario.</p>
