<p class="p">The baseline population had 199,539 individuals [based on the estimated count on 30 June 2007 from the ABS (
 <xref rid="c2" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>)] and was projected by the QGSO (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) to be 355,409 in 2036. Age- and sex-specific percentages of transitions from salmonellosis to health or to a sequelae condition in the simulated population were consistent with expectations for the literature-based transition rates used as model inputs (see Table S2). For example, 4.3% of simulated males 0â€“9 y old transitioned from salmonellosis to PI-IBS, consistent with the 4.4% transition rate used in our model. In addition, the distribution of the simulated Central Queensland population with regard to age and sex was generally consistent with QGSO projections for 2036 (see Figure S1).
