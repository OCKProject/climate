<p class="p">For the present analysis, we estimated the effects and costs of climate change on hospitalizations for severe cases of salmonellosis and on the common sequelae reactive arthritis (ReA) and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), in addition to estimating the effects on the incidence of salmonellosis. In addition, we used microsimulation models to account for dynamic changes in population size and characteristics (age, sex, and salmonellosis risk) over time due to births, migration, death, and the likelihood of moving between health states (e.g., from healthy to contracting salmonellosis, or from salmonellosis to PI-IBS). We used these models to estimate the years of quality life lost because of salmonellosis and its sequelae according to age, sex, and specific disease outcomes, after accounting for changes in incidence as a consequence of climate change, with the goal of informing strategies to reduce the incidence and costs of salmonellosis in the future.</p>
