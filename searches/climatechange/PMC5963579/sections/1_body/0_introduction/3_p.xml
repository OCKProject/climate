Therefore, we hypothesized that warmer temperatures and altered rainfall patterns projected for Queensland under climate change might influence the incidence, and the related health and economic costs, of salmonellosis. Estimates of these costs are key to highlighting to policy makers the importance of developing effective preventative strategies to reduce the incidence of salmonellosis.
