<p class="p">Queensland, the northeastern state of Australia, has a higher salmonellosis incidence than most Australian states. Annual incidence rates have increased from 47 reported cases per 100,000 people in the early 1990s to approximately 83 reported cases per 100,000 people in recent years. Along with improved detection techniques, a possible driver of this increase could be climate change. Several studies have identified associations of warmer temperatures and rainfall patterns with increased salmonellosis incidence across different climatic regions. For example, D’Souza et al. (
 <xref rid="c14" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>) evaluated monthly salmonellosis cases reported in five Australian cities over a 10-y period and found that the mean temperature in the previous month predicted both monthly salmonellosis notifications and seasonal patterns. A

 <xref rid="c17" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>) reported that weekly salmonellosis cases increased with weekly mean temperature in Alberta, Canada, although the same association was not found for the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. In New Zealand, Lal et al. (
 <xref rid="c30" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) found that salmonellosis was positively associated with temperature during the current month and with the Southern Oscillation Index (a measure of regional climate conditions related to El Niño) during the current and previous month. Finally, Zhang et al. (
