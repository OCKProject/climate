<p class="p">We have identified only one study to date that has quantified the potential future health costs of salmonellosis in Queensland. The study estimated the morbidity burden of salmonellosis in Brisbane, Queensland’s capital city, in 2030 and 2050 under projected climate changes (

The authors estimated that the warmer projected temperatures, in conjunction with population growth, would result in losses to the population of 80–106 y of health to salmonellosis in 2030 and of 99–129 y in 2050, compared with 53 healthy years lost in 2000, the baseline year (
