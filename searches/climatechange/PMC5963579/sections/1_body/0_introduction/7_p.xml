<p class="p">Microsimulation offers advantages over other projection methods such as extrapolation techniques and cohort-component models. Projection by extrapolation takes an incidence rate from a baseline period and applies it to a future population structure to estimate the future incidence of a disease or condition. Extrapolation produces data for discrete time points, typically a baseline year and one or more individual years in the future (
 <xref rid="c25" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Huang et al. 2011</xref>). In contrast, microsimulation models incorporate dynamic population fluctuations over the entire simulated period. For example, a microsimulation can account for changes in the size of the at-risk population due to transitions from one health state to another, as well as changes in higher- or lower-risk subpopulations due to demographic shifts, such as shifts in the underlying age structure of a population related to projected changes in birth and death rates.
