<p class="p">Our objectives were to estimate the future health and economic costs of salmonellosis in Central Queensland from 2016 to 2036 under baseline and climate change scenarios and to demonstrate that microsimulations are useful models for estimating these costs. We hypothesized that the climate changes projected for Central Queensland by 2036 would increase the costs of salmonellosis. Understanding the potential future costs of salmonellosis under climate change is important for informing the need for and the direction of preventative strategies.</p>
