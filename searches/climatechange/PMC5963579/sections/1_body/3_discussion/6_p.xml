<p class="p">Our microsimulation also assumed that the duration of each state was fixed and constant for all individuals. We selected values for the duration of each state from the literature, using the average or most likely value when known (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). If the values used reflect true durations, and if the range of possible durations is normally distributed and constant among population subgroups, then the durations used should produce population-level estimates that are correct on average. However, future studies should investigate methods to sample durations for each incident case from a range of possible values to more accurately estimate the time that simulated individuals were in each health state.
