<p class="p">Another limitation is the uncertainty in the cost estimates generated. We confirmed that model projections were consistent with expectations given our assumptions (model inputs) regarding changes in the population over time [by comparing our simulated population with projections by the QGSO (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>)] and the age- and sex-specific probabilities of developing a sequelae condition (by comparing incidence rates in the simulation population with the rates used as model inputs). We also took the average of 100 simulations and calculated confidence intervals to quantify the uncertainty introduced by stochastic decisions within the models. However, we were unable to control for or quantify other sources of uncertainty in the parameters, such as uncertainty in the effects of weather on salmonellosis or uncertainty in the extent of under-reporting of salmonellosis cases.
