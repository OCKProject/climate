<p class="p">The primary strength of this study is that, to our knowledge, we are the first to report estimates of the costs of salmonellosis in Queensland and to evaluate the factors that may be driving these costs. This information may be used to inform health policies. We also believe that this is the first study to estimate the health and economic costs of a disease related to climate change using microsimulation. We demonstrated that microsimulation is a useful tool for modeling complex interactions between weather, disease, and demographic variables, and it can provide a wealth of data. Some examples of how these rich data could be used include plotting the projected rates of salmonellosis over time by age group and sex, examining the projected cases in school-age children to estimate days lost from school, and examining the projected numbers of severe sequelae in the elderly to plan future hospital demand. We plan to share the data from our microsimulation models to allow other researchers and policy makers to combine or isolate data of interest to them.</p>
