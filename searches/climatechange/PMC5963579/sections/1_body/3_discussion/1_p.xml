<p class="p">Estimates from our microsimulation analysis suggest that the risks of salmonellosis and its sequelae, and the resulting health and economic costs, will increase in Central Queensland under the influence of climate change until 2036. Our model assumed higher risks of salmonellosis and its sequelae in females than in males, and in younger children than in other age groups, consistent with the literature; therefore, the higher estimated costs for these groups (for both the climate change and baseline climate scenarios) were consistent with expectations. PI-IBS accounted for the majority of the estimated costs, regardless of assumptions about climate change, because of its 5-y duration and the resulting loss of QALYs. We found that microsimulation models were a useful technique for modeling the influence of climate change on disease processes. With microsimulation, we were able to integrate several complicated associations—weather, salmonellosis incidence, time, and demographic influences—to produce clear estimates of the health and economic costs of salmonellosis (and capture projection uncertainty) and to identify the primary drivers of these costs. Higher incidence rates of salmonellosis assumed for children, of PI-IBS for young adults, and of sequelae conditions for females were key drivers of the estimated costs of salmonellosis in Central Queensland under climate change and baseline scenarios. Policy makers and local authorities may be able to use this information in developing preventative strategies targeted for these groups. For example, educating parents, child care workers and early-education teachers about food hygiene practices could reduce salmonellosis cases and costs for young children. Broader media campaigns geared toward children and their parents raising awareness about food safety information and of the prevalence and potential sequelae of salmonellosis may also serve to reduce cases and costs of salmonellosis.</p>
