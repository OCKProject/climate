<p class="p">We have likely overestimated the costs of hospitalizations and sequelae conditions. Salmonellosis cases that are reported to health departments are typically more severe than cases that are not reported. In adjusting the number of reported cases of salmonellosis to account for under-reporting, we “added” the low-severity cases that were not reported. However, the probabilities of hospitalization and of developing sequelae conditions were drawn from studies of the outcomes of reported cases of salmonellosis. In applying these figures to the adjusted number of salmonellosis cases, we transitioned too many mild cases to hospitalizations and sequelae conditions, although the extent of this overestimation cannot be quantified. In addition, we were unable to identify suitable data to enable us to estimate the medical expenditure costs, and therefore the total economic costs, for ReA.</p>
