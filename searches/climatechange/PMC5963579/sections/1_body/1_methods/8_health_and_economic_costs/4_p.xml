<p class="p">Costs incurred in the future are typically valued less than those incurred at present because present costs defer resources from being immediately invested elsewhere, thus disallowing a positive return on such investments (
 <xref rid="c16" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Drummond et al. 2015</xref>). Individuals also tend to value benefits received immediately more than those received in the future (
 <xref rid="c34" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Mathers et al. 1999</xref>). To reflect this valuation, we applied annual discounting of 3% to both the health and economic costs to reduce future costs for each year in the future they occur. A 3% discount aligns this study with key studies of disease costs such as the earlier Australian and Global Burden of Disease (BOD) studies (

 <xref rid="c11" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Begg et al. 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="c50" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">WHO 2008</xref>), although discounting has since been removed from the later BOD studies (
 <xref rid="c7" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2016</xref>). Discounting was applied by multiplying the annual health costs and the annual economic costs by the discount factor derived using the following formula:
