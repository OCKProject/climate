<p class="p">We have calculated three costs: the health costs, the morbidity costs, and the economic costs of salmonellosis and its sequelae. The health costs refer to the number of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) lost, which was calculated by multiplying the number of days that simulated individuals spent in each unwell state (salmonellosis, hospitalized, recovering from severe salmonellosis, ill with ReA, or ill with PI-IBS) by the corresponding disability weight for that state (Figure 1) and summing the resulting values for the population as a whole. We then calculated the morbidity costs as the economic value of the years of healthy life lost by multiplying the QALYs for each outcome by
