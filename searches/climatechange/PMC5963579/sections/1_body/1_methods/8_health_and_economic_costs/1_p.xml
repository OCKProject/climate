<p class="p">Based on Batz et al (
 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>), the probability of mortality among individuals with severe salmonellosis in our model was 0.004% of hospitalized cases; therefore, it was consistent with expectations that there were no deaths caused by salmonellosis in the simulated population. Consequently, our estimates of costs due to years of health lost, the economic value of these lost years, and medical expenditures are limited to costs associated with morbidity due to salmonellosis or the sequelae conditions.
