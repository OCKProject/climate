<p class="p">Microsimulation models have two components: a base population that forms the model’s starting point and structured states through which individuals can transition (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>). Several sources of data were required, including 
 <italic class="italic">a</italic>) a baseline population, which is a “snapshot” at the start of the simulation of the population to be modeled; 
 <italic class="italic">b</italic>) the probability of transitioning between states; 
 <italic class="italic">c</italic>) the effects of temperature and rainfall on salmonellosis to model the effect of climate change;
