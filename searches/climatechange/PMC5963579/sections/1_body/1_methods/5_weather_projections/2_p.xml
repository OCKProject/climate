<p class="p">GCMs are mathematical models of Earth’s physical processes, including the atmosphere, oceans, land, and vegetation, which are used to generate long-term climate projections (

The CCSP generated projections from 19 individual GCMs and composite projections for 4 representative future climate (RFC) groups that included GCMs that differ primarily with regard to rainfall projections and are characterized according to the degree of warming—either warm or hot—in the East Indian and West Pacific Oceans (

 <xref rid="c49" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Watterson 2012</xref>; see Table S1). For the present analysis, we used composite projections for the West Pacific (WP) RFC group (which included the BCCR, CSIRO-MK30, GFDL-21, IAP-FGOALS-G10, INMCM, and NCAR-CCSM GCMs), which represents a moderate change scenario resulting in a warmer and drier climate in the Queensland area.
