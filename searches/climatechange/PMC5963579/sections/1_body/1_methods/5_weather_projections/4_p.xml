<p class="p">We obtained projections from the WP RFC group for the A1FI scenario from the CCSP for 88 weather stations in Central Queensland for 2030 and 2050. (Although our simulations ended in 2036, we used projections for 2050 to linearly interpolate data for 2031–2036.) Data for each station included the maximum and minimum temperature and rainfall on each day in 2030 and 2050, which were projected from 50 measured baseline values for the same day at each weather station during 1960–2010, resulting in 50 projections for each day in 2030 and 2050. To generate regional climate projections, we calculated a single set of daily projections for 2030 and 2050 for each station by averaging the 50 projections for each day, then calculated the mean daily temperature by averaging the minimum and maximum temperatures on each day, and then averaged the daily mean temperature and precipitation across the 88 stations to produce average regional daily weather projections for the Central Queensland area. We used the same approach to derive baseline daily values for Central Queensland based on data measured at each weather station on each day during 2004–2013, which were provided by BOM (BOM, written communication, 2014).</p>
