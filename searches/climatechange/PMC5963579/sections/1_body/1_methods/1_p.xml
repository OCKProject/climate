<p class="p">We developed a microsimulation model to project the Central Queensland population to 2036. The model is graphically represented in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref>. Simulated individuals transitioned between healthy and unwell states according to probabilities that we identified from the literature, and the size and characteristics of the simulated population were determined by migration, mortality, and fertility rates based on values obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (see

We ran two versions of the model for the years 2016â€“2036: a baseline model with no change in climate and a climate change model that accounted for estimated effects of projected changes in temperature and rainfall on the risk of contracting salmonellosis in Central Queensland. We ran 100 simulations of each version, averaged the results of the simulations to account for variation in the populations introduced by the stochastic decisions made within each simulation, and calculated 95% confidence intervals (

Zinn) in R (version 3.1.2; R Development Core Team), which we adapted to include the health states involved in the salmonellosis disease process, in addition to the existing demographic states such as sex, fertility, and migration.
