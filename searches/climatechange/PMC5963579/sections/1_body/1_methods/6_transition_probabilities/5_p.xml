<p class="p">A systematic review of 18 studies in 8 countries found a pooled incidence rate for PI-IBS of 10% following gastrointestinal infections (
 <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thabane et al 2007</xref>). Other studies have made similar estimates of 8.5% (
 <xref rid="c21" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Haagsma et al. 2010</xref>) and 7% (
 <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Neal et al. 1997</xref>), although estimates vary from 4–35% (

 <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Thabane and Marshall 2009</xref>). We selected the 10% incidence rate for the current study because Thabane et al. (
 <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) examined the largest number of studies, and those studies were predominantly set in countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada, which have similar sociodemographic characteristics and health systems to Australia’s. Thabane et al. (
 <xref rid="c46" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>) and Thabane and Marshall (
 <xref rid="c47" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) reported that younger individuals were more likely to develop PI-IBS, which has been supported by Neal et al. (
 <xref rid="c37" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>), who found that six months after a bacterial infection, 34% of 19–29-y-olds experienced altered bowel habits compared with 26% of 30–44-y-olds, 31% of 45–59-y-olds, and 9% of individuals
