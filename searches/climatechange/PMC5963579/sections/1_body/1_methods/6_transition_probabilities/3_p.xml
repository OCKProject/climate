<p class="p">From the literature, we obtained the age- and sex-specific probabilities of transitioning from salmonellosis to ReA or PI-IBS or of being hospitalized for severe salmonellosis and the probability of dying or returning to health from these states (see 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Batz et al. (
 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) estimated that 1.9% of cases of salmonellosis required hospitalization, from which 0.04% of individuals died and 99.96% recovered. We could not identify reliable data for the age- or sex-specific proportions of hospitalized salmonellosis cases or cases that resulted in death, although we acknowledge that these differences likely exist, and as such, these figures from Batz et al.

 <xref rid="c10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2014</xref>) were applied for all ages and across both sexes.
