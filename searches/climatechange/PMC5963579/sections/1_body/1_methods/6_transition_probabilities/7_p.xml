<p class="p">We initially ran the models from 2008–2036, and the early results clearly showed that the base population required a period of time, or burn-in, for the model to begin transitioning individuals at the expected rates. Because all individuals started the simulation as susceptible to salmonellosis, that is to say, in the “healthy” state, elevated annual rates of salmonellosis and reduced rates of sequelae conditions were initially observed. This phase occurred in the simulated period from 2008 to 2015, and this period of time was excluded as a burn-in. Model simulations for 2016–2036 were used as results. The model allowed individuals to be in only one health state at once; as such, only individuals who were in the “healthy” state were susceptible to salmonellosis, and all individuals in other health states, such as PI-IBS or ReA, were immune to a new infection until the duration of that state had passed.</p>
