<p class="p">Authors of an exhaustive literature review to estimate the incidence of salmonellosis and its sequelae in Australia circa 2010 concluded that approximately 8.5% of individuals with salmonellosis subsequently developed ReA (
 <xref rid="c18" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ford et al. 2014</xref>). ReA appears to affect women and adults more than men and children. For example, a Dutch case–control study of 193 cases of salmonellosis found that 88% of ReA cases resulting from salmonellosis occurred in women, and all cases occurred in individuals

Although only 4% of cases were confirmed as ReA, these studies indicate that ReA can occur in children, but at a lower incidence than in adults. For the present study, we adopted the figure of 88% of cases occurring in females, and we allocated approximately 13% of cases to individuals 0–19 y of age (age groups were 10-y blocks, so this figure could not be applied to those 0–18 y of age).
