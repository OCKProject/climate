<p class="p">We calculated the baseline probability of contracting salmonellosis by 5-y age group and sex from the daily number of salmonellosis cases in Central Queensland reported to Queensland Health between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2013. Salmonellosis is a legally notifiable disease in Queensland; however, reported cases under-represent community incidence because some affected individuals do not seek medical care, and some cases are not tested for 
 <italic class="italic">Salmonella</italic> or may have a false negative test result (
 <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hall et al. 2008</xref>). To account for under-reporting, we multiplied the number of reported cases by age group and sex by 7, as recommended by Hall et al. (
 <xref rid="c22" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2008</xref>) according to their estimate of the proportion of salmonellosis cases likely to be under-reported in Australia during 2001–2005; this estimate was based on survey information regarding the probability that an individual with gastrointestinal symptoms would visit a doctor and have a stool test, the probability of a false negative or false positive stool test, and the probability that a positive case would be appropriately reported. To limit our analysis to the number of cases most likely to be influenced by climate change within Queensland, we reduced the estimated number of cases for each age group and sex to account for salmonellosis infections that were not foodborne (28%) and those not acquired in Australia (15%) using estimated proportions reported by the Australian Department of Health for 2010 based on a review of information from multiple sources (
 <xref rid="c29" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Kirk et al. 2014</xref>). The estimated case numbers were divided by the average population by age group and sex during 2004–2013 (
 <xref rid="c5" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ABS 2014</xref>) to estimate the baseline incidence rate of salmonellosis by age group and sex. The average annual incidence rates between 2004 and 2013 by age group and sex are presented in
