<p class="p">We obtained the daily number of salmonellosis cases reported in Central Queensland from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2013 from Queensland Health (J. Marquess, Queensland Health, personal communication). The date of the case was the date a patient's stool sample was collected, which is the closest available date to when infection occurred.

Stafford, epidemiologist, Queensland Health, personal communication, 30 April 2015). We adjusted for this step-change in our models described below.</p>
