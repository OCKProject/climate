<p class="p">We summed the daily relative risks in 2030 and 2050 and divided them by the summed daily relative risks for the baseline period to produce a relative risk ratio (RRR) of salmonellosis under climate change in 2030 and 2050 compared with the baseline period. From these data, we linearly interpolated the risks for the years 2008–2029 and 2031–2036, assuming that the risks changed at a constant annual rate over the time period.</p>
