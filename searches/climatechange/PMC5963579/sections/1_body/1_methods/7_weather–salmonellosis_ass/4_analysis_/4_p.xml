<p class="p">We derived age- and sex-specific rates of salmonellosis by multiplying the total RRR by the proportions of cases according to age group and sex, and we converted the resulting age- and sex-specific risk estimates to instantaneous rates for use in the microsimulation model. This approach differs from the more commonly used approach for calculating rates, in which the dynamic at-risk population is included in the Poisson regression models as an offset [for example, see Alho and Spencer (
 <xref rid="c8" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2005</xref>)]. Therefore, we compared the transition rates derived using both methods to assess the potential impact of the alternative method on our estimates.
