<p class="p">After starting the simulation, the population changed as individuals entered the population through birth and immigration and left through death and emigration. Model parameters for rates of fertility, mortality, and migration were based on estimated age- and sex-specific rates from the ABS. Fertility rates were estimated from the average fertility rate in Central Queensland between 2006 and 2011 (
 <xref rid="c4" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ABS 2013b</xref>). Mortality rates (from the healthy state) were based on the risk of death in Queensland in 2012, which was similar to those in adjacent years (
 <xref rid="c3" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ABS 2013a</xref>). Immigration rates were estimated by determining the annual number of immigrants entering Central Queensland as the average of the financial years 2006–2007, 2010–2011, and 2013–2014 (
 <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ABS 2015</xref>). We then multiplied this figure by the number of years being simulated to determine the number of immigrants likely to enter Central Queensland during the simulated period. We estimated the emigration rate as the average number of emigrants from Central Queensland in the financial years 2006–2007, 2010–2011, and 2013–2014 (
 <xref rid="c6" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">ABS 2015</xref>) divided by the population of Central Queensland in 2011 (
 <xref rid="c39" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">QGSO 2014</xref>) as a midpoint year for which population data were available. All rates were held constant, but the actual numbers of births, deaths, and migrants varied as the age and sex structure of the population changed over time.
