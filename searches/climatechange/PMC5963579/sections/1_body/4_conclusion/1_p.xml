<p class="p">Results from our microsimulation model of salmonellosis through 2036 in Central Queensland suggest that health and economic costs are likely to be higher under the climate change scenario that we evaluated than under a scenario that assumes no changes in climate. Salmonellosis already incurs substantial costs to the community, making it worthy of preventative action to reduce the cost. The key cost drivers in both the baseline and climate change scenarios are the high rates of salmonellosis incidence in children and of sequelae conditions in females, particularly PI-IBS, which accounts for two-thirds of the total cost of salmonellosis. These drivers are based on input parameters that were sourced from the literature and are largely independent of climate change, except that the increased incidence of salmonellosis under climate change spurs the higher costs from both acute infections and sequelae. These findings highlight areas where preventions could be directed, such as local initiatives to improve the food hygiene practices of children, or broader measures such as introducing industry regulations to achieve reductions in salmonellosis and subsequent sequelae conditions throughout the population.</p>
