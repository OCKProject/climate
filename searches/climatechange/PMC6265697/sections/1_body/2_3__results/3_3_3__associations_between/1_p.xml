There was a significant interaction between season and year (i.e., the association between season and hospital admissions depended on year). Specifically, admissions were higher in the dry season than the rainy season, except in 2014 (
 <xref rid="ijerph-15-02402-t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Finally, when controlling for season, year, ward, and the interaction between season and year, the rate of admissions for all diagnoses was significantly higher when the average temperature was extremely high (i.e., 95th percentile (22.3 to 29.7 Â°C)) on the day of admission. That is, admissions for all causes were higher on extremely warm days, contributing to an increase in average admissions from 37.1 patients per day to 43.0 patients per day.
