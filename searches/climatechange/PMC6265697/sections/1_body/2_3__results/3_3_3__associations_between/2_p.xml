<p class="p">The hospital admissions model fit the data well and the partial autocorrelation plot indicated that there was no residual temporal auto-correlation. The plot of BLUPs for month indicated they were non-parametric (i.e., not normal); however, the model fit was substantially better (i.e., lower BIC) with a random-effect for month than without, thus, the random-effect for month was maintained in the model.</p>
