<p class="p">A total of 41,216 hospital admission records were collected from BCH between 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2014, of which 3294 were adult in-patient admissions, 5736 were pediatric in-patient admissions, and the remaining 32,186 were out-patient admissions. Females accounted for 54.6% of pediatric in-patient records and 44.0% of adult in-patient admissions; records of sex were incomplete for out-patients. The majority of patients (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 29,261; 71.0%) presented with a single diagnosis, with an average of 1.3 (range: 1–14) diagnoses per hospital admission. The majority of all hospital admissions were adults (i.e., ages 19–55 years old; 41.1%), followed by children (i.e., ages 0–5 years old; 20.9%). Hospital admissions were rarely identified as a re-admission to the hospital for the same diagnosis (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 87; i.e., 0.2% of cases were readmissions). Approximately half of the records for the pediatric ward and adult in-patient wards were manually entered to fill gaps in the database; however, since the out-patient department accounted for the majority of admissions, less than 10% of the total data were missing in the original database.
