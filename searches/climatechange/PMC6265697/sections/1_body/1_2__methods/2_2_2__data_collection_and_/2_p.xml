<p class="p">To characterize hospital admission patterns in Kanungu District, clinical data for all visits to the out-patient, pediatric, and adult in-patient wards (i.e., both male and female areas of the ward) were collected from an existing electronic database at BCH. Nurses on the out-patient department recorded patient data directly into an electronic triage system, while nurses on the adult in-patient and pediatric wards recorded patient data first to paper and later entered the information into the electronic database. Out-patient records were available for 1 December 2011 to 31 December 2013; pediatric records were available for 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2014; and adult in-patient records were available for 1 December 2011 to 31 July 2014. Data collection was restricted to the period 2011 to 2014 as the hospital records prior to this period were not available in electronic formats. Paper records were used to manually fill in any gaps/missing data in the database. Data collected for each patient included diagnoses (i.e., co-morbidities), admission date, and treatment ward (i.e., out-patient, pediatric, or adult in-patient). Diagnoses at BCH were made according to the Uganda Clinical Guidelines National Guidelines for Management of Common Conditions [
