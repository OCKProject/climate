<p class="p">Meteorological data were collected via satellite through a partnership with researchers at McGill University from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-analysis (ERA)-Interim Climate Database [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], which combined data from multiple sources. The ERA-Interim climate databases have spatial resolution of 0.75° by 0.75° [
 <xref rid="B34-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>]. Daily values for total precipitation (i.e., rainfall (mm)), as well as maximum, minimum, and average temperature (°C) were obtained for all dates matching the extracted medical records (i.e., 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2014). Meteorological values extracted from the database were used to automatically generate dichotomous variables for extremely low and extremely high daily values (i.e., 5th and 95th percentiles, respectively) for precipitation; maximum, minimum, and average temperature; as well as temperature difference on a given day (i.e., difference between maximum and minimum temperature). Meteorological data were merged with clinical data for the date of admission (i.e., day zero), and lags of one to seven days were generated automatically for each meteorological variable [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Short lags have been recommended for this type of analysis to avoid introducing collinearity between meteorological and seasonal variables [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Season was categorized as rainy or dry based on date: rainy seasons were defined as March to June and September to November, and dry seasons were defined as December to February and July to August [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]. Hospital admission records were collapsed into daily counts by ward (i.e., each observation represented a count of admissions into out-patient, pediatric, or adult in-patient wards on a given date).
