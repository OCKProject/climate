<p class="p">To examine associations of hospital admissions for all diagnoses with seasonal and meteorological parameters (objective 2), regression analyses were conducted. Specifically, multilevel, multivariable Poisson regressions were used to examine if daily number of admissions for all diagnoses were associated with meteorological variables. Multilevel multivariable Poisson modeling was selected as the outcome was count data, a random effect was used to control for time, and the effect of weather on admissions was adjusted using multivariable analyses, which is similar to methods used by other climate-health research [

 <xref rid="B38-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>]. To build the multivariable models, a number of steps were followed sequentially. First, a causal diagram was created: the outcome variable was counts of hospital admissions per day, where the denominator was held constant as the number of people eligible to use the hospital (i.e., the hospital services a population of 100,000 people in Kanungu District [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>]); the exposure variables of interest were meteorological parameters (i.e., four meteorological parameters and 5th and 95th percentile for each for day of admission and 7 days lag); and confounders (identified 
 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic>) included season, year, and treatment ward. Confounders were forced into the models. Next, independent variables were examined using descriptive statistics. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to identify any collinearity between independent variables using a cut-point of |0.8|; if high correlations were noted between two independent variables, the variable selected for subsequent analyses was based on biological plausibility. Next, locally weighted scatter-plot smoothers were used to visually explore linearity between continuous independent variables and the outcome, and categorized if appropriate. Then, a manual forward-model building approach was used to build a multivariable Poisson regression model [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. A series of univariable Poisson regressions were conducted to examine the unconditional association between the outcome variable and each independent variable using a liberal alpha-value (α = 0.20). All variables with 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &lt; 0.20 were added manually and sequentially to the model, beginning with the variable that had the lowest statistical significance 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic>-value. Variables were removed if 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> &gt; 0.05 and put back into the final model following step-wise procedures to re-examine associations before final exclusion [
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Global significance tests were used to evaluate the statistical significance of categorical variables as a group. Interactions (i.e., cross-products) were examined based on biologically plausible combinations of independent variables. Biologically plausible interactions included interactions between meteorological parameters within one day of each other (i.e., on the same day or the day before or after) and between season and year. Autoregressive structures were investigated using graphical techniques (i.e., partial auto-correlation plots) and compared. Assessments of model fit performed on the multilevel model included examining residual plots, best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) plots, and partial autocorrelation plots. Analyses were conducted in Stata
 <sup class="sup">®</sup> (version 13.1, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA) using a standard alpha-value (α = 0.05) unless otherwise stated. In addition to multilevel Poisson models, ordinary Poisson and negative binomial models were fitted. However, based on evaluating Bayesian Information Criteria for each model, the multilevel Poisson model provided the best fit.
