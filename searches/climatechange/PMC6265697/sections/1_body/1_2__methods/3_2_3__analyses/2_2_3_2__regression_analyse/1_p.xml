<p class="p">Two multivariable linear regressions were used to examine the effect of season and year on (1) average daily temperature, and (2) total daily precipitation. Global significance tests were used to test the overall significance of categorical variables. Two-way cross-products (i.e., interactions) were assessed between season and year. Assumptions of linear regression were assessed, including linearity of continuous independent variables, normality, and homoscedasticity.</p>
