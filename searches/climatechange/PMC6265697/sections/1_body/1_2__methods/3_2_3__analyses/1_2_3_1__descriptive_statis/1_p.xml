<p class="p">To describe admissions to the hospital by diagnoses (objective 1) and to provide context for the results overall, descriptive statistics were conducted as in other studies [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]. Specifically, Descriptive statistics were used to investigate BCH admission counts by ward, age group (i.e., &lt;5 years, 6–12 years, 13–18 years, and &gt;55 years), and sex. Counts and frequencies of admissions were tabulated. The denominator for hospital admission counts was held constant, as the population eligible to use the hospital did not change. The population in this region is not migratory and there were no other reasons for substantial changes in the population denominator from 2011–2014. Counts of diagnoses recorded more than 500 times in the database were tabulated by ward. Descriptive statistics were calculated for meteorological variables, providing further context to interpret the results.
