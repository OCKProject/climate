<p class="p">Climate change projections for Africa consistently project increased temperature across 121 models, showing an increase in average annual temperature ranging from 1 to 7 °C by the year 2100 [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Our short-term meteorological findings in Southwestern Uganda reflect this warming trend, with average annual temperature increasing by 0.6 °C, over the four year study period. In Uganda, projections indicate temperatures will continue to increase [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>], which has relevance for our findings [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. High temperature (i.e., above the 95th percentile) was positively associated with same-day admissions, which is consistent with research findings from other tropical African communities at high altitudes [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. It is possible that the altitude and forest cover in this region, which have a moderating effect on temperature [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>], has resulted in locally relative cold temperature adaptation of residents in this area [

 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Furthermore, heat related climate change adaptation strategies like air conditioning and fans [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>] are not feasible or available to the majority of residents in Southwestern Uganda, which can increase admissions to hospital for a variety of causes [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. This highlights the importance of accounting for local contextual variables in climate change adaptation, which is essential for effective anticipatory adaptation [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Local information is critical for climate change adaptation planning, since variability of processes and relationships increases at small scales [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This type of research can inform localized planning, such as developing and implementing early warning systems and informing planning processes, in both high-income and low-income regions, as well as contribute to the implementation of adaptation planning [
 <xref rid="B45-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>]. Supporting and improving healthcare centres is considered to be one of the most effective measures to increase climate resilience in the short-term [
