<p class="p">Some study limitations should be considered. First, this research was conducted at a local hospital, which functioned on a fee-for-service model. Thus, sampling bias should be considered with regards to vulnerable sub-populations, particularly those in the lowest income brackets [

 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>], as they may be unintentionally excluded from analysis. This means that the results reflect relationships between seasonal and meteorological parameters and hospital admissions, but may not represent the relationships with disease patterns at the community-level. However, we sought to examine healthcare service provision demands to inform adaptation planning and not to describe community health status. Second, percentiles rather than thresholds for extreme temperatures were used in this research to identify local temperature extremes, which can make comparisons to disease incidence estimated in other studies difficult. By utilizing percentiles to identify locally relevant temperature extremes, we have addressed concerns from previous work that populations living in tropical climates have a higher threshold for heat tolerance [

 <italic class="italic">a priori</italic>, and thus would not have biased the results. Further, it is worth noting that the data used to backfill gaps in the electronic database were still recorded in the same way as the original records, at the same time and by the same staff members, and that only data entry into the electronic database was conducted by the research team. Fourth, this dataset represents a short time series (i.e., four years) and thus does not represent associations between hospital admissions and long-term climate or climate change parameters. Additionally, while the seasonal changes in hospital admissions at BCH could reflect disease epidemiology [

 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>], it could also be explained by hospital accessibility. For instance, some factors that affect hospital access in low-income regions may change by season and/or year, including household income [

 <xref rid="B57-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">57</xref>]. Fifth, while regression models, such as the mixed-effects Poisson regression used in this study, are commonly used in climate health research [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], these modeling strategies do not account for political and contextual factors that would further influence hospital admission patterns or future uptake of this information in Ugandan and international climate-health adaptation planning sectors. Therefore, socio-economic pathways and decision making also impact health outcomes and should be considered when discussing application of these results to inform future hospital planning in low-resource areas. Finally, while there is sufficient biological plausibility to explain an association of high temperature with hospital admissions, since we assessed a relatively large number of variables it is worth noting that our findings could also align with statistical chance, due to Type 1 (Î±) error, where the null hypothesis was that meteorological predictors were not associated with hospital admissions.
