<p class="p">Climate change adaptation in the health sector in low-resource settings is often difficult, contributing to a significant adaptation deficit [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. Numerous barriers to climate change adaptation have been identified in the Sub-Saharan African context: physical, financial, technical, social, informational, institutional and governmental, and historical, among others [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. In response, in Uganda, successful adaptation strategies have been built on bottom-up community-based initiatives [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">48</xref>], had available human and financial resources to support adaptation, and had the ability to access useful and relevant information when needed [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>,
 <xref rid="B50-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. In our study, we attempted to build on previous lessons learned for adaptation in Uganda by using existing datasets for hospital admissions and meteorological data, which was relatively low-cost. Furthermore, we aimed to facilitate stakeholder involvement and bidirectional communication, building on evidence that this contributes to successful adaptation [

 <xref rid="B51-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]. Finally, by recognizing the importance of scale in health sector climate change adaptation [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>], we focused on reaching local priorities to increase institutional support [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. As such, investigating patterns in local meteorological parameters and hospital admissions may be beneficial for climate relevant hospital planning at local scales in low-resource contexts [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Understanding these context-specific relationships could be useful to improve preparedness [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], and could support shifting from reactive to anticipatory climate change adaptation for the health sector [
