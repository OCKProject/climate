<p class="p">We found significant differences in average daily temperature by year and by season, suggesting there may be variability in seasonal conditions year-to-year, which is in concordance with other regional climate analyses [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Specifically, we observed significant increases in temperature on a short time scale [
 <xref rid="B47-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">47</xref>]. We did not observe an effect of year on precipitation in this study period; however, longer periods may show a change in precipitation patterns in the future. Since seasons were defined by historical precipitation patterns [
 <xref rid="B22-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>], the main effect of season on rainfall was expected.
