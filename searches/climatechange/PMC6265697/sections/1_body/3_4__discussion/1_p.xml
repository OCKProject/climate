<p class="p">This study aimed to investigate associations of seasonal and meteorological parameters with hospital planning admissions for all diagnoses in Kanungu District, Uganda, in the context of hospital planning for climate change. Calls for policy action from the East Africa Planning for Resilience in East Africa Through Policy, Adaptation, Research, and Economic Development Project have highlighted the need for research to understand climate-sensitive diseases in this region [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Similar to other studies from the African continent, communicable diseases were the leading reasons for admissions at BCH [
 <xref rid="B39-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>]. The most common diagnoses at BCH (i.e., acute respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>], acute gastrointestinal illness [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>], and malaria [
 <xref rid="B41-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>]) are highly climate-sensitive diseases, and have been identified as top climate-health concerns by community members [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] and policy makers [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>] in this region. Climate-sensitive diseases are of particular interest to inform climate adaptation for the healthcare sector [
 <xref rid="B42-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>], as they reflect the most probable, and likely most substantial, changes to the burden of illness to come. However, sufficient information on climate-sensitive diseases to inform climate change adaptation is limited, and access is often complicated in low resource regions, such as East Africa [
 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>].
