 <xref rid="B21-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]. Analyses of existing healthcare use and meteorological datasets may provide additional information for hospital planning in the context of climate change in low-resource settings. Since climate change is a key concern and recognized vulnerability in Uganda, adaptation for localized environmental change and its impacts on health are crucial for healthcare providers. Healthcare planning at hospitals and health centers may be informed by an analytical tool that provides a low-cost and feasible opportunity to apply knowledge of local relationships between meteorological parameters and health while simultaneously considering common adaptation barriers in low-resource settings.
