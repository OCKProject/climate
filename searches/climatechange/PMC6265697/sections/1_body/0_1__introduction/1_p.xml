 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. However, the direction and magnitude of the associations vary globally [

 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>], these geo-spatial variances matter, as effective climate change adaptation often requires localized and context-specific actions [

 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. For this reason, it is important to document and understand localized associations between meteorological parameters and hospital admissions as a potential way to inform planning and preparedness measures that can support climate change adaptation in the healthcare sector [
