<p class="p">Research investigating associations of seasonal and meteorological parameters with hospital admissions has predominantly focused on high-income regions, including North America and Europe [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>]. Some research is available for low-income regions [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>], including Africa [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. Of the little research on seasonal and meteorological associations with hospital admissions that has been conducted in Africa, much has focused on specific health outcomes, which vary by host, environment, and agent. For example, in East Africa, warm temperatures were associated with increases in cholera epidemics [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] and hospital admissions for malaria [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. In contrast, cold temperatures were associated with increases in hospital admissions for heart failure [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] and hypertension in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and for preeclampsia in South Africa [
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>]. African rainy seasons have been linked to increases in hospital admissions for hypertension in Nigeria [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>], and to pneumonia, malnutrition, and snake bites in Zambia [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Furthermore, the incidence of other diagnoses, such as diarrhea and malnutrition [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>], and hospital admissions for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>], have been associated with increased precipitation. Dry seasons have been linked to hospital admissions for some respiratory illnesses and coughing [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>]. Moreover, the association of meteorological parameters with hospital admissions for a particular disease may vary by climate region [
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. For example, in Gambia, the direction of the association between temperature and RSV admissions depended on whether the region is a temperate or tropical climate, while the association between precipitation and RSV was consistent regardless of climate region [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-15-02402" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. Therefore, associations between disease and meteorological parameters identified in a number of African studies tend to be locally specific and vary by health outcomes, and little is known about the collective impact (i.e., overall influence) of meteorological or seasonal parameters on hospital admissions for all diagnoses.
