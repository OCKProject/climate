<p class="p">While other studies examine associations of a single diagnosis with season and meteorological parameters, we intentionally focus on hospital admission counts for all diagnoses, using a case study in Uganda to explore overall primary healthcare service provision demands, and discuss our findings in the context of climate change adaptation for the healthcare sector. The goal of this study was to investigate associations of seasonal and meteorological parameters (i.e., weather data) with hospital admission counts for all diagnoses in Kanungu District, Uganda. Specifically, the objectives of this study were to: (i) Describe admissions to the hospital by diagnoses; and (ii) examine associations of hospital admissions for all diagnoses with seasonal and meteorological parameters.</p>
