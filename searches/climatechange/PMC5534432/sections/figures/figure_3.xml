  <p class="p">Variation in annual total phosphorus load under combined climate change and agricultural change scenarios for three UK catchments.Predicted changes to annual total phosphorus (TP) load from the mean of all behavioural runs from Hydrological Predictions for the Environment model (HYPE). Climate change scenario is 2050s high emissions (2050H) from UK Climate Projections 2009 Weather Generator. Agricultural change scenarios are represented by modifying P inputs by up to ±80%. Present day and 2050s high emissions scenario with up to ±80% change in P inputs for Newby Beck, Eden 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>, Blackwater, Wensum 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> and Wylye, Avon 
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>. The 
   <italic class="italic">horizontal line</italic> represents the present day annual load (mean of all behavioural runs) and the required level of reduction in the future. Large reductions in P (20–100%) are required to offset the projections of increased annual load due to climate change in the 2050s (high emissions)
