 </sup> which samples the multi-dimensional parameter space to find sets of parameters which produce acceptable models which satisfy the evaluation criteria (termed behavioural models). While we recognise the sampling size is not extensive, given other experimental uncertainties we consider the chosen trajectories are indicative of the potential for change and in balance with all other computational and experimental design constraints. Models were evaluated using the Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficient

 </sup> for discharge (Q) and for P. The thresholds for behavioural parameter sets were chosen to give the best 10–15 behavioural parameter sets. For Eden these were: NSE ≥ 0.6 for Q and NSE ≥ 0.5 for P; for Wensum these were NSE ≥ 0.55 for Q and NSE ≥ 0.53 for P; for Avon these were NSE ≥ 0.6 for Q and NSE ≥ 0.6 for P. The ranges for parameter sets used in the projections are given in Supplementary Data
