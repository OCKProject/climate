<p id="Par35" class="p">RCM-1.5 km is much more computationally demanding and, therefore, we use results from two 12-year simulations: one for the period 1996−2009 and a 12-year simulation representative of the year 2100, under the RCP 8.5 scenario. The high resolution, convective permitting model allows more realistic representation of rainfall at a local scale, particularly for extreme events
