<p id="Par38" class="p">We made future projections of P load under combined climate change and agricultural change scenarios using HYPE. The agricultural scenarios, indicating a change in intensification of agriculture, were represented by increasing or decreasing the fertilizer and manure inputs (−80, −50, −20%, no change, +20, +50, +80%). No changes were made to point source inputs. Annual and seasonal loads were calculated as above.</p>
