<p id="Par10" class="p">We combine the modelling presented above with a simple representation of future land management scenarios, which were determined following structured stakeholder elicitation workshops in each of the catchments. Stakeholders discussed and selected likely land management options from a range of possibilities. Most participants favoured the use of cover crops; this was strongest in the arable catchment, where this management measure is already in use and has undergone both field testing and modelling of impact

 </sup>. Soil conservation is of high importance in this catchment, where erosion of arable topsoil has been identified as a key concern (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). In the more livestock-dominated catchments, an increase in winter housing for livestock and increase in slurry spreading were considered most likely. Both of these measures would affect the P loading on the soil, either in timing or quantity, and are likely to exacerbate the already identified concern of spreading livestock waste (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). The percentage of stakeholders in agreement with these scenarios is given in Supplementary Fig.
