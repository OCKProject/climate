<p id="Par6" class="p">Using the parameters and models identified using the observed field data (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref> (HYPE) and Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> (DBM)), models are driven with the baseline climate data from UKCP09-WG to generate a range of P loads valid for current conditions (Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). The dominant effect of rainfall in driving diffuse P loads from agricultural land is clearly shown by the relationship between annual rainfall and annual P load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), where annual rainfall explains between 61% (Wensum) and 82% (Eden) of the annual P load, including the variability over 26 years of each model run. In spite of the non-linearity introduced by including a representation of the hydrological and soil processes in the process-based model HYPE (shown by deviation from the straight line in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>), this non-linearity is still relatively small compared to the dominant rainfall driver.
