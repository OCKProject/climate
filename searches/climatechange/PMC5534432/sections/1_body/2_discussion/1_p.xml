<p id="Par14" class="p">The effects of mitigation measures are hard to identify in observed data, because they are heavily masked by the inter-annual variability in rainfall, which translates to the large range in P loads under both simulated present day and future climate conditions (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The effects are further obscured in catchments where non-agricultural sources of P are a dominant contributor to poor water quality. However, overall trends in the flow regime between the present day and future are clear in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> (with full uncertainty ranges in Supplementary Data 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>), which shows large percentage increases in winter rainfall and discharge. Increases in rainfall volume and intensity both have the potential to increase phosphorus transfers, through increased surface runoff and associated soil erosion. Also, increased recharge of deeper water reserves may result in more transfer of dissolved phosphorus forms. The dominance of high rainfall, as a driver of phosphorus load (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) has been noted in other studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>
 </sup>, particularly during high erodibility periods. The relationship could be used on its own as a simple estimator of future phosphorus load, (e.g., as in Ockenden et al.
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup>), but the models used here improve on this simple estimation by including the non-stationarity of the relationship which results from the change in rainfall distribution in the future and the resulting change in effective rainfall.
