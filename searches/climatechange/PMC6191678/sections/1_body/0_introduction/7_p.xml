<p class="p">Based on the foregoing argument, applying a complementarity of both traditional and locally oriented solutions with the aid of by external support would suffice a lot. Marango et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2016a</xref>) postulated that failure of co-existence of scientific and indigenous knowledge (IK) led to the current level of the negative effects of climate change. This is so because fighting climate change from an external and broader global perspective alone remains a daunting task at a local level. Instead, valuing local adaptive beliefs and practices complemented by external perspectives provides a working solution to tackle the deadly climate change phenomenon. It is important to note that traditional climate change adaptation strategies are more compatible with local realities. This is so because livelihoods differ from one setting to another (Mavhura 
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2017</xref>). Important to note is the fact that the impacts of climate change are equally felt at different levels within country settings (Dube &amp; Phiri 
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Against this background, the aim of this paper is to explore the role of traditional authorities, in particular their potential as climate change adaptation strategists. Traditional leaders are recognised as ‘strategic agents of change at the community level’ (Baldwin &amp; Muyengwa
