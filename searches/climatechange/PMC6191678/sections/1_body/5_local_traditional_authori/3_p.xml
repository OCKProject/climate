<p class="p">To date, conflicts over sharing resources within communities have widely been documented particularly with regard to water, which is directly affected by changing the climate (Manyeruke et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). Traditional leadership forms an immediate institution to resolve conflicts within communities because they are custodians of customary lands (Senganimalunje, Chirwa &amp; Babalola 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>). According to the traditional conflict transformation concept (Boege 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>), the aim is to restore community order and harmony as opposed to punishment of perpetrators for deeds done in the past. The main emphasis is restitution as a basis for reconciliation within conflicting communities (Boege 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>). Thus, the ultimate goal is not to inflict punishment on perpetrators of conflict but to reintegrate them and restore good relations (ibid). External intervention alone to deal with issues of land and water shortage may be inadequate. Bamidele (
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2011</xref>) argues that when governments intervene and establish agricultural projects and commercial farm enterprises, for instance, the result is often further destabilisation of land relations. The traditional ‘restorative justice’ approach to justice as opposed to ‘western-style punitive justice’ (Boege 
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2006</xref>:07) is highly needed when dealing with environmental issues such as climate change. This is simply because social cohesion is a prerequisite to reducing the number of environmental deviants within communities.
