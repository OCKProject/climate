<p class="p">Together, climate change and land‐use change have the potential to significantly alter ecosystems, communities, and populations. Moreover, these two global changes can interact, resulting in greater alterations and positive feedback (Riordan and Rundel

 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Despite these large‐scale trends, climate change and land‐use change may influence populations and species differently, such that some populations may be primarily threatened by climate change, while others are more susceptible to land‐use change. For managers, understanding which threat is preeminent for a given population, in addition to understanding the potential interaction among stressors, is vital to creating successful conservation plans. Here, we explore how both climate change and land‐use change may influence an endemic, endangered US species.
