<p class="p">The Red‐cockaded Woodpecker (RCW, 
 <italic class="italic">Picoides borealis</italic>) was listed as an endangered species in 1970, largely due to widespread habitat loss (US Fish and Wildlife Service 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). RCWs are dependent on mature, open, pine woodlands maintained by frequent fire. These pine ecosystems have suffered widespread declines due to logging for timber and agriculture, coupled with fire suppression (US Fish and Wildlife Service 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The majority of remaining RCW populations are found on federal lands, and consequently, the Red‐cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan identifies national forests and military installations as critical for recovery (US Fish and Wildlife Service 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Although US military installations provide sanctuary for many threatened and endangered species, training of military troops frequently requires intensive alteration of the landscape, often in ways that are not compatible with habitat and foraging needs of the various species living on the installation. Furthermore, these installations will be as susceptible to the impacts of climate change as other parts of the landscape. Climate‐driven changes in the pine forests of the southeastern USA have the potential to eliminate what remains of suitable RCW habitat (Hansen et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0021" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Furthermore, changes in precipitation could alter insect availability or foraging behavior. Thus, this RCW population is likely threatened by both climate change and land‐use change despite their protected status as a listed species.
