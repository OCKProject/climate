<p class="p">Here, we use a spatially explicit, individual‐based population model to explore the relative effects of climate change and land‐use change on the RCW population on Fort Benning, located near Columbus, Georgia, USA. Fort Benning has fewer than 300 RCW clusters – RCWs breed in small cooperative groups that use a cluster of cavity trees – and is designated as a primary core recovery population (US Fish and Wildlife Service 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). The installation's recovery goal is 351 potential breeding pairs across the approximately 74,000‐ha installation. The installation is dominated by loblolly pine (

 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>); however, current forest management includes prescribed burns on an approximate 3‐year cycle and planting longleaf pine seedlings. We compare the impacts of multiple spatial arrangements of land‐use change, climate‐driven changes in vegetation, and the potential for climate‐driven changes in reproduction on population dynamics over a 100‐year period.
