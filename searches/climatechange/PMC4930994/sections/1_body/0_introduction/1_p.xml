<p class="p">Climate change and land‐use change are likely to be two of the most important drivers of environmental change over the coming century (Sala et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0038" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>). The best‐documented changes in biota in response to climate change are shifts in species distributions and changes in phenology. However, for many animal species, changes in climate are likely to lead to changes in habitat, food availability, and altered predator–prey and competitive relationships (Schneider et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>). Species with specialized habitat requirements, narrow environmental tolerances, specific environmental triggers for phenological events, dependencies on species interactions, and poor dispersal abilities may be more susceptible to climatic changes (Foden et al.
