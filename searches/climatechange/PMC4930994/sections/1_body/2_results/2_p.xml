<p class="p">No changes in the dominant vegetation were projected for Fort Benning under any climate model or emissions scenario. The LPJ‐GUESS model outputs suggested that the study area would remain suitable for needle‐leaved evergreen trees, the primary habitat type of RCW. Thus, as we modeled it, climate change had no impact on RCW habitat at Fort Benning. Similarly, our simulations showed little impact of changes in April precipitation on the final number of potential RCW breeding pairs at Fort Benning. Population trends resulting from the simulations using the projected future climates were not different from those resulting from simulations run with a constant (current) climate (
