<p class="p">Yearly spatial RCW population data do not exist for this population, so we were unable to compare modeled and actual population distribution as a method of model evaluation (i.e., hindcasting). We ran the model 20 times for each replicate development scenario (nine different series of landscapes) and climate change scenarios (nine different climate scenarios). The spatial data layers (described above) were incorporated into the simulations at 10‐year (land‐use) or 1‐year (climate) intervals to explore the effects of two factors on the RCW population.</p>
