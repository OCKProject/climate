<p class="p">The population model followed the yearly cycle of events typical for RCWs (Fig.

Although HexSim makes constructing extremely complex models possible, we attempted to build the simplest defensible model that captures the essential aspects of RCW biology. As reproductive output for a population of RCW is limited by the number of females of reproductive age (Conner et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), we modeled females only. Females are rarely helpers in cooperatively breeding RCW clusters; thus, the helper class was not modeled (Conner et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Females without established clusters were modeled as a separate floater class. This floater class moved through the landscape and settled available territories vacated after the death of the previous female, or areas that were not part of another female's territory. Floaters did not reproduce.
