<p class="p">We used the HexSim modeling platform (version 1.4; Schumaker 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) to build a population model for simulating the impacts of land‐use change and climate change on the RCW population at Fort Benning. HexSim is a spatially explicit individual‐based modeling framework that simulates population dynamics over time given spatial data layers and population parameters. HexSim is a framework in which simulation models are constructed. HexSim itself contains no embedded parameters, equations, or specific processes that must be incorporated into its models. HexSim models are normally designed around available data, with poorly understood processes being left out, represented probabilistically, or explored via sensitivity analysis.
