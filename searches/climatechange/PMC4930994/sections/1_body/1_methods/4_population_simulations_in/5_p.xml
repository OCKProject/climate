<p class="p">We parameterized the model so that quality of a cluster was based on total habitat quality (sum of all hexagons in the cluster). Target quality for establishing a cluster was set such that the spatial occupancy of the modeled population reflected current spacing and density of RCWs at Fort Benning. Any hexagon with a habitat quality of at least 1% of maximum was eligible for inclusion in RCW home ranges. Thus, RCW home ranges could include areas of low‐quality habitat, including fragmented areas, provided enough high‐quality habitat was present to meet the minimum range value. In addition, home ranges in our model can vary in size widely based on quality of available habitat, allowing for higher density in areas of high‐quality habitat. Any RCW that did not find a home range that met the minimum range quality became a floater without a home range. These floaters would move again in the next yearly cycle to try to establish a home range, following the movement routine (Table

 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), all juvenile birds (fledglings) became floaters in their first year and moved to establish a new home range.
