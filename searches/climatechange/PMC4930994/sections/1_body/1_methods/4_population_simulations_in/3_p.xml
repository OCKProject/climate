<p class="p">We parameterized HexSim to start with 800 RCWs (ages 0–14 years) placed randomly in the landscape. This number was selected to be far above the potential carrying capacity of the population to ensure that the simulated woodpeckers had an opportunity to become established throughout the landscape. After a 50‐year initialization period, the model stabilized at approximately 290 RCW breeding pairs on the landscape in the baseline scenario, which is similar to the current number of RCW pairs present at Fort Benning (~280 breeding pairs).</p>
