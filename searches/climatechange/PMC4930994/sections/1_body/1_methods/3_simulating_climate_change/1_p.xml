<p class="p">The potential effects of climate change on the RCW population at Fort Benning were assessed in two ways. First, we assessed the effect of future climate change on vegetation using the outputs of an ecosystem model, LPJ‐GUESS (ver. 030124; Smith et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0046" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Vegetation projections were run for nine different future projected climates from three general circulation models (GCMs): CCSM3 (Collins et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>), CGCM3.1(T47) (Scinocca et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0044" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>), and UKMO‐HadCM3 (Pope et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0034" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) run for three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B, and A2 (Nakicenovic et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2000</xref>) (Shafer et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>)). LPJ‐GUESS simulates vegetation in the form of plant functional types, such as broad‐leaved evergreens or grasses. These plant functional types can be combined to represent major biomes and habitat types (e.g., forest, grassland). LPJ‐GUESS also simulates changes in the fire regime and response of the vegetation to that change and to increased atmospheric CO
