<p class="p">Second, future climate projections were used to model the potential effects of precipitation on RCW reproduction. Previous work suggested that spring precipitation may influence reproductive output in this species, primarily through reduced foraging activity by adults in heavy rain (Neal et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1993</xref>). In the current population, a significant negative relationship between RCW reproductive success (mean fledglings produced per nest attempt) and April precipitation was detected (

 <italic class="italic">y</italic> = 1.819 − 0.0024 × mean April precipitation). This relationship was used to project the effects of future climate on RCW reproduction. We extracted April precipitation from the nine future climate projections (Shafer et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>) and mapped those projections for each year. The precipitation projections in these layers were then used to influence reproduction in the population model using the empirical relationship described above.
