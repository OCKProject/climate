<p class="p">We used random forests (Breiman 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0002" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>), an ensemble classification technique, to build predictive models of habitat probability using data on forest composition and structure at Fort Benning, GA (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32204-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). We divided known presence and absence data into training and test data sets by randomly withholding one‐third of presences and one‐third of absences (90 points each) to serve as test data. The remaining data were used to train the models. We used the R statistical package RandomForest to build model predictors. For each model, we built 500 trees using two randomly selected variables of the three total predictor variables as candidates for each split in the tree. This habitat map correctly identified active clusters in the test data 81% of the time and correctly identified absences in the test data 88% of the time. Although including more parameters may have increased the overall accuracy of the habitat map, all parameters in the model could be projected under future conditions. This baseline habitat map was the foundation for all further habitat maps generated under the scenarios described below. This map and all other spatial layers were developed on a grid of 50‐m × 50‐m cells.
