<p class="p">At military installations such as Fort Benning, land‐use change occurs primarily through the development of training areas. To simulate land‐use change, a map of proposed training areas was used as a baseline of future development (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A). These areas do not necessarily represent actual development on the installation, but are useful to estimate the land area that might change due to additional training needs. The training areas range in size from 0.02 ha to 1107.98 ha (median: 9.00). The training areas shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A were added to the baseline landscape by reducing the habitat quality within each area according to the estimated impact of each development on RCW habitat (M. Barron, pers. comm.). For example, areas designated as buffer zones around firing ranges had less impact (habitat quality reduced by 50%) on habitat than did the large area that was to be clear‐cut and used for tank training (habitat quality reduced by 90%). Each pixel within each development was multiplied by the value shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A, such that a development with a rating of 0.1 would reduce the existing habitat to 10% of the original habitat probability. This new habitat map with the developed areas in place, hereafter “baseline development map” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>B), reflects a current plan for base development, and thus, land‐use change to which the base is already largely committed. We developed three development scenarios that built off of this baseline development map. In these three development scenarios, three or four new areas were developed every 10 years during the 100‐year simulations. The area of additional development in the scenarios is equal to the area shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A, and thus, by the end of the 100 years, the area of new development will be twice that shown in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A (total new development equal to 8.6% of the land area).
