<p class="p">We generated three development scenarios (Conservation, Convenience, and Worst‐case) with three replicate landscapes for each (Table 
 <xref rid="ece32204-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). In the Conservation scenario, new developments were placed in poor‐quality habitat (below 0.57, Table 
 <xref rid="ece32204-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>). In the Convenience scenario, developments were placed within 400 m of a road. In the Worst‐case scenarios, developments were all placed within RCW habitat. For each scenario, developments (drawn at random without replacement from the set of development areas depicted in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>A) were placed randomly within constraints listed above (which varied by scenario, Table 
 <xref rid="ece32204-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>) and habitat quality was reduced accordingly. Three replicate landscapes were generated for each of the three scenarios with a different random placement of the development areas. Maps were generated for each 10‐year increment, reflecting that decade's new developments, plus any previous decade's developments so that by year 2090, all new areas were in place on the final map for each scenario. All mapping and scenario building was completed in ArcGIS 9.3.1 (ESRI
