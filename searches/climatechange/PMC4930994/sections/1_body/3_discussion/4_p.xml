<p class="p">Climate change had little effect on RCW habitat in our ecosystem models. Although other broad‐scale studies have projected potential changes for the vegetation of much of the southwestern USA, the vegetation projections that we used showed little change in the general type of forest at Fort Benning over the coming century (Shafer et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). While these models give some idea of the basic vegetation types that will dominate an area, they do not provide projections of which plant species will dominate or whether the structure of the forest will change in more subtle ways. Although our models did not indicate a change in forest cover, if climate change results in an increase in the hardwood midstory, RCW may be negatively affected. Presence of hardwood midstory vegetation is associated with cluster abandonment in RCW and low habitat suitability (Conner et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Thus, increases in hardwood midstory would either reduce the habitat suitability for RCW, or require expensive manual removal of hardwoods from RCW habitat.
