<p class="p">Our finding of a strong effect of a reduction of habitat quality for RCW in high‐quality areas is not particularly surprising, given this species' very specific habitat requirements. RCWs are dependent on mature pine savanna habitat, particularly longleaf pine systems (Walters

 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Thus, areas with higher quality habitat could support more RCW clusters. These studies combined with the results of the current study suggest that providing more high‐quality habitat will help increase the number of RCW on the landscape in areas that are not developed.
