<p class="p">Our findings suggest that habitat loss (modeled here through land‐use change) may be a more important threat to some species than climate change. Similar patterns have been found for birds at a global scale (Jetz et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>) and several other organisms. For example, a recent study found that high‐elevation Andean plant species were highly susceptible to human land‐use change, while climate change in the absence of land‐use change had a smaller negative effect on these plants (Feeley and Silman 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). Similarly, extinction risk for three Mexican cloud forest species was low despite projected climate change when the remaining cloud forest was protected from land‐use change, largely because dispersal was sufficient to prevent extinction when the landscape was relatively intact (Ponce‐Reyes et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). Thus, RCW, like many other species, may be more susceptible to land‐use change than climate change.
