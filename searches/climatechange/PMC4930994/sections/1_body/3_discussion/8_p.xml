<p class="p">Our results stress the importance of land‐use change even in the face of large projected shifts in environmental conditions, such as those associated with climate change. Perhaps more importantly, although tempered by the caveats above, this is a positive message. Despite the fact that land‐use change is a formidable threat that has already caused the extinction of many species, it is a threat for which there are clear solutions. Climate change is a far less manageable challenge, many of the true solutions to which will require coordinated action on a global scale.</p>
