<p class="p">Our findings suggest that prioritizing habitat conservation may enhance the resilience of many systems to climate change. A recent analysis found that for temperate deciduous forest and warm mixed forest biomes, land conversion due to agriculture and timber expansion is expected to have a much larger effect on biodiversity loss than climate change, while the tundra, savannas, boreal forest, and cool conifer biomes are expected to be more impacted by climate change (Sala et al.

Targeting conservation actions by identifying which systems are primarily threatened by each stressor could increase the return on investment for conservation dollars, as land‐use change could be restricted in those areas highly susceptible to development and those systems where dispersal through intact habitat may counteract the negative effects of climate change, while climate adaptation and management activities could focus on those ecosystems with higher susceptibility to climate perturbations.
