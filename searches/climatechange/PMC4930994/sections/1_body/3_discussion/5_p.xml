<p class="p">Changes in precipitation due to climate change did not result in reduced numbers of potential RCW breeding pairs. This result was surprising given the projected increase in spring precipitation (range: +1% to +27%) for the Fort Benning study area (Shafer et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). However, precipitation as high as 300 mm for the month of April did not result in mortality of all fledglings within a cluster, suggesting that although high levels of precipitation may reduce the overall number of fledglings that successfully fledge, each cluster is still able to produce at least one fledgling. Because each cluster is still reproducing, it is possible that the population as a whole is still buffered from years of low reproduction due to the floater class of older but unreproductive females. The results suggest that RCW may be less vulnerable to climate change than other species because of the floater class, which also buffers RCW populations against demographic stochasticity (Walters et al.

 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>), suggesting that RCW may be phenotypically plastic in response to some aspects of climate change.
