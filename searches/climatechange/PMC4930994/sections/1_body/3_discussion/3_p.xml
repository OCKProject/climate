<p class="p">Even in the baseline development scenario, which included only planned developments that have either already occurred or are slated to occur in the near future, the installation did not meet its recovery goal of 351 breeding pairs, suggesting that without additional management, the installation will not meet the recovery goal. Most of this observed population growth on Fort Benning in the past several years was likely driven by successful cavity creation (Doresky et al. 
 <xref rid="ece32204-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, it remains to be seen whether artificial cavity creation can sustain population growth in the face of landscape changes that include new development for training. Indeed, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service issued a Biological Opinion stating that the planned land‐use changes used as our baseline development scenario would jeopardize RCW recovery (US Fish and Wildlife Service
