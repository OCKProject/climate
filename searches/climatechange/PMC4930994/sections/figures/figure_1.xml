  <p class="p">(A) Map of training ranges added to the landscape at Fort Benning. This map formed the baseline range development scenario from which all other range development scenarios were generated. Values indicate the effect of each range on Red‐cockaded Woodpeckers (RCW). The habitat ratings in the initial habitat probability map were multiplied by the values shown to downgrade habitat quality where new ranges were placed. Lower values indicate a larger negative effect of the range on 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">RCW</styled-content> habitat. (B) Baseline development habitat map for 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">RCW</styled-content> using proposed training ranges shown in A. Each range shown in A was placed on the landscape in the location shown in A and habitat within the range was reduced based on estimated impact of the range on Red‐cockaded Woodpecker habitat quality. Values in the legend represent likelihood of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">RCW</styled-content> presence, where higher values indicate higher likelihood of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" class="styled-content">RCW</styled-content> presence.
