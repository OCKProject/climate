<p class="p">The pathogen-host interaction (termed ‘common ash with 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus’</italic>) was modelled by constraining the distribution of common ash by the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic>, i.e. by calculating the differences in probability of occurrence between common ash and 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic> in each geographical cell. This method is comparable to the one implemented by Schweiger and colleagues
