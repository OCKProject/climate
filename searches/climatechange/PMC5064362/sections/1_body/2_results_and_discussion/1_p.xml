<p class="p">Common ash is widely distributed in Europe, ranging from the Atlantic coast to the Volga River in Russia (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a</xref>); its northern limit occurs at ~64°N in Norway and its southern boundary is located at ~37°N and the environmental requirements of the species are well-known

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>. To estimate the spatial distribution of common ash (

 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic> (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1b</xref>), we selected presence-only methods and applied a Species Distribution Model (SDM), the Maximum Entropy algorithm (MaxEnt
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>), and an Ecological Niche Model (ENM), the Non-Parametric-Probabilistic-Ecological-Niche model (NPPEN
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" class="xref">18</xref>). The bioclimatic parameters were derived from the Climate Research Unit dataset (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The consistency between simulated contemporary occurrences and species observations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>) was assessed by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) and the true skill statistic (TSS). Our results revealed that both models showed high ability to reproduce the overall species distributions; AUC values were as high as 0.96 and TSS values ranged from 0.83 and 0.92 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Although MaxEnt reproduces the contemporary spatial distribution of the host and its pathogen slightly better, the two models showed comparable estimates of contemporary geographical extent (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Our projections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1c,e</xref>) confirmed that the spatial distribution of common ash is constrained by aversion to cold winters and hot dry summers

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. The European distribution of the pathogen was reproduced well by the two models and no occurrence of
