<p class="p">Over the next decades, both climate change and disease are expected to affect forest ecosystems considerably

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39" class="xref">39</xref>. Some diseases may be controlled by climate because both temperature and water availability govern pathogen development

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref> and thereby disease-spreading
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Here, our study also reveals that climate change, by affecting the host and the pathogen separately, may uncouple their spatial distributions, involving a mismatch in the speciesâ€™ interaction
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref> with putative consequences for density-dependent transmission
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>. Consequently, although the direct effect of climate change upon common ash is expected to be negative in southern and occidental regions where warming might favour the extension of the Mediterranean ash

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>, it may at the same time alleviate the ash dieback crisis as climate change expands the ranges of both species polewards
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25" class="xref">25</xref>. Our study therefore reveals the complexity of biological pathways through which climate change may affect species and biotic interactions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40" class="xref">40</xref>. Distribution models could provide useful information to help design reintroduction programmes to better manage forest ecosystems
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41" class="xref">41</xref>. While foresters are unwilling to invest in common ash planting, our results show that it is too early to abandon its exploitation. However, it remains challenging to better document host-pathogen interactions

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>: landscape pathology would provide insights about dispersal ability of the fungus

Initiatives are already ongoing to ensure the sustainability of common ash in Europe (e.g. the FRAXBACK COST action, Nornex) and will allow foresters to base conservation decisions not on instinctive reactions but instead on ecological scenarios
