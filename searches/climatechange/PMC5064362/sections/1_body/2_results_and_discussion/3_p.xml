<p class="p">Change in the spatial distribution of common ash and its pathogen under future climates was investigated using ‘Representative Concentration Pathways’ (RCPs) scenarios
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The pathogen-host interaction was modelled by constraining the distribution of common ash by the presence of 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic>, a common approach to incorporate biotic interactions at large spatial extents
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27" class="xref">27</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. Both models revealed a positive effect of climate upon the geographical extent of common ash and this was also frequently combined with a reduction in pathogen prevalence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3</xref>) in relation to the different levels of warming (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>). The percentage of increase in the geographical extent of common ash also depended on the magnitude of warming. For Scenario RCP2.6, the spatial area covered by common ash (excluding the fungus) was predicted to increase from 1 to 10% over the 21
 <sup class="sup">st</sup> century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). The coverage of the pathogen rose after an initial decrease although remaining frequently negative (from −16% to +6%). When the interactive effect between the tree and its pathogen was taken into account, the combined effect translated into an increase in the geographical extent of the tree ranging from 15 to 30% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a,b</xref>). For Scenario RCP4.5, the climatic effect on common ash was higher in magnitude (from 2–17%) whilst changes in 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic> were similar to those expected with RCP2.6 (from −14% to +6%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3c,d</xref>). Consequently, both models projected an increase in common ash when the influence of the fungus was considered (&gt;50% with MaxEnt and &gt;35% with NPPEN for 2080–2099). For Scenario RCP6.0, the influence on the tree was similar to that observed for a lower level of warming but strongly negative for the pathogen (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). From 2050, a reduction between 20–37% of 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic> was observed. When the interactive effect of the pathogen was included, both models projected an increase greater than 40% in the geographical extent of common ash at the end of the century (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3e,f</xref>). For Scenario RCP8.5, the climatic effect on the tree remained highly positive (from 17–26% from 2050) although a plateau was observed with NPPEN from 2060 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3g,h</xref>). Although occurring later with MaxEnt, the two ecological models projected a pronounced reduction in the pathogen (~50% for the last decade) and revealed the major impact of high temperature on the viability and growth of 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23" class="xref">23</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24" class="xref">24</xref>. When the pathogenic influence was considered, changes in common ash varied in both direction and magnitude, and plateaued from 2060 with NPPEN. Consequently, the maximum gain was obtained with MaxEnt for the last decades (&gt;70% compared to &gt;45% with NPPEN).
