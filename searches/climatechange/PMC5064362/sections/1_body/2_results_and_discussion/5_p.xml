<p class="p">We realise that phenomenological models have a number of limitations. First, to model the ecological niche of both species, we had to assume that the contemporary distribution of common ash and its pathogen is in equilibrium with climate
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30" class="xref">30</xref>. Although that assumption is likely to be correct for the pathogen, especially in southern Europe (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), the longevity of adult trees inevitably means they will persist for a while after unsuitable climatic conditions have appeared
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31" class="xref">31</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32" class="xref">32</xref>. Second, we also assumed unlimited dispersal, which is unlikely to be the case for common ash even though dispersal distances up to 3 kilometres have been recorded
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>; here, the main consequence would be to anticipate too quickly the arrival of the tree to newly suitable areas. Third, our model does not consider either additional projected infestations (e.g. the Emerald Ash Borer
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>) or the effect of extreme climatic events that may affect existing populations strongly
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4" class="xref">4</xref>. For example, the extreme heat wave and drought during summer 2003 triggered the collapse of Scot pine (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. We also do not consider possible variation in the susceptibility of different ash genotypes to 
 <italic class="italic">H. fraxineus</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" class="xref">35</xref> and we assume ecological niche conservatism
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36" class="xref">36</xref>, i.e. the niche shape remains unchanged over the study period. Unfortunately, phenomenological models cannot consider processes of host-pathogen coevolution that may influence our results
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38" class="xref">38</xref>. Despite those limitations, our study investigates a large range of scenarios using two presence-only models (a SDM and an ENM), up to seven GCMs and four levels of warming and considers both direct and indirect (i.e. interactive effect of the pathogen) effects of climate change on common ash showing how climate change factors should at least be considered when planning ecosystem management.
