<p class="p">We investigated changes in the spatial distribution of the host and its pathogen associated with global climate change by averaging species projections resulting from the 7 GCMs for each RCP scenario for the period 2080â€“2099 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Figs 4c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">5c</xref>). When global warming was pronounced (RCP6.0 and RCP8.5) both MaxEnt and NPPEN indicated there would be a major poleward movement of the pathogen, with populations only persisting in Scandinavia and the Baltics. The occidental common ash populations were only slightly affected when warming became too intense (Scenarios RCP6.0 and RCP8.5), especially for projections based on NPPEN (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5" class="xref">Fig. 5a</xref>). Although the direct effect of climate on common ash was negative in occidental and southern European countries (e.g. England, France or the Balkans), the virulence of the fungus is also expected to decrease in these areas. When host populations decline and fragment, pathogens with density-dependent transmission face a lowered chance of infection
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29" class="xref">29</xref>, and while the strength of this positive feedback is difficult to evaluate in our study, it could reduce infection rates at the southern edge of common ash distribution but exacerbate infection at the centre of the spatial distribution of the tree
