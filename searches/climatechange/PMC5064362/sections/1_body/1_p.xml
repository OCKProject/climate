<p class="p">In Europe, the common ash is currently threatened across most of its distributional range by a new lethal disease known as ‘Chalara dieback of ash’ that is caused by the ascomycete

Here, we examine the potential influence of global climate change upon both the spatial distribution of common ash and its pathogen, and upon how these two species may interact in future.
