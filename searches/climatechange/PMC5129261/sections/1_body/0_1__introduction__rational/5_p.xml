<p class="p">There is currently neither a framework nor detailed analytical work that has been implemented showing the specific state of water resources management, agriculture, water quality, and public health with reference to climate change in Pakistan. Therefore, this paper aims to critically review scientific studies to assess the need for water conservation, risk management, and the development of mitigation measures to cope with the water-related impacts of climate change on agriculture and subsequently on public health, particularly from the Pakistani perspective. Novel solutions and strategies benefiting a wide range of generalists and stakeholders will be presented to control environmental pollution and to promote public awareness, and deliver the basis for a conceptual framework for the assessment of current and future scenarios.</p>
