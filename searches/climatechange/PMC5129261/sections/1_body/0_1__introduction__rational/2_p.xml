<p class="p">With changing climate conditions such as rainfall, temperature, and humidity, water has great impacts both on agriculture and health. Water availability and quality are deteriorating and waterborne diseases are subsequently increasing, which impacts both sectors. Water quality in relation to climate change is not properly studied, especially the impact of climate change on water-related (both water- and vector-related) diseases. In Pakistan, waterborne diseases like cholera and vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever are prevailing with the changing rainfall pattern, temperature, humidity, etc. Water availability for agriculture is important as about 90% of water is used for irrigation purposes in many countries. With changing climatic conditions, water availability will affect agriculture and livestock production. There is a strong need to study these impacts with changing climatic scenarios.</p>
