<p class="p">Biosensors have specific interactions between enzymes and substrate, and are highly specific in their detection capabilities. Bio-sorption is another emerging and novel technique for the removal of toxic metals from wastewater. Zouboulis et al. [

 <italic class="italic">Bacillus licheniformis</italic> for cadmium and chromium removal. They reported that bacteria have a high surface area-to-volume ratio like metallic nanoparticles, and that they therefore provide a large contact interface, which interacts with metals from the surrounding environment. Pyridine is one of the most widespread heterocyclic industrial contaminants. A new strain of
