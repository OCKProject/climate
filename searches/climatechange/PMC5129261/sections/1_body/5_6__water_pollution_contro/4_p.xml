<p class="p">Some solutions for the removal of environmental pollutants are conventional such as synthetic and natural coagulation, adsorption, and anaerobic digestion of contaminants. In comparison, others are advanced such as emerging nanotechnology-based techniques (e.g., the use of silver nanoparticles, titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, iron nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes) for the removal of contaminants [

 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]. Both conventional and advanced solutions aim to provide and maintain better solutions to environmental pollution. Reducing contaminants can help in improving both environmental and human health. Improved housing design and better pipe material used in water supply can assist in reducing environmental pollution and improving public health in developing countries [
