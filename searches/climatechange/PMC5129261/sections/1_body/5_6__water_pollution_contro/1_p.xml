<p class="p">This section follows the logic of the three previous sections: 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3-ijerph-13-01051" class="xref">Section 3</xref> links climate change to flooding, which impacts the environment, usually increasing water pollution. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec4-ijerph-13-01051" class="xref">Section 4</xref> indicates how water quality is linked to public health. Finally, 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec5-ijerph-13-01051" class="xref">Section 5</xref> links more specifically agricultural water pollution to human health. Raw and agricultural water pollution and its impacts on human health are discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6-ijerph-13-01051" class="xref">Section 6</xref>. Commonly used detection techniques and strategies developed by scientists to control the current problems and the need to develop new techniques under changing climatic conditions are assessed.
