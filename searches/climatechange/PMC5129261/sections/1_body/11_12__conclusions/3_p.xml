<p class="p">There is also a requisite to encourage regional and national authorities such as the Ministry of Climate Change and authorities working under the Ministry of Science and Technology and the Ministry of Food Security to intervene and to make changes in policies and laws with respect to climate change that affect the water, health, and agriculture sectors. Contradictory policy measures like electricity subsidies to farmers for tube wells in different provinces of Pakistan (especially in Baluchistan, where it is difficult to get water from aquifers due to low water tables) and loans for providing additional sugar mills, rather than improving existing ones, should be reconsidered. Introduction of heat resistant and flood (or drought) tolerant varieties as well as more yield- and water-efficient crop varieties, drought resistant grasses, and plants in urban areas (especially along the roadsides) should be introduced to conserve water. Development of better strategies like water channels to conserve water and dam constructions to enhance water storage are important to save Pakistan during both drought and flood events. The adaptation of more crops to the ‘less drops strategy’ to minimize the effects of water-related impacts due climate change on agriculture, water quality, and their subsequent health concerns should be encouraged.</p>
