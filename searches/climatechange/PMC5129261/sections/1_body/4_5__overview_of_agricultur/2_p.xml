 <xref rid="B29-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>]. Crops are often irrigated with wastewater polluted by domestic and industrial effluents containing heavy metals, which are potentially absorbed by vegetables and other cash crops, ultimately becoming part of the food chain. Literature [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>] reported on potential toxicological risks of heavy metals on the public health using contaminated food. Urban agriculture has prominent effects on human health in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and spreading of water-related diseases such as malaria. Antonio-Nkondjio [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] pointed out that urban agriculture has a major role in spreading resistance to insecticides and malarial diseases.
