 <xref rid="B59-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">59</xref>]. Climate change has dynamic impacts on surface watercourses such as rivers, streams, and lakes, which provide clean water. In order to protect water resources, policy makers should consider climate change impacts on the reduction of pollution for improving water quality [
