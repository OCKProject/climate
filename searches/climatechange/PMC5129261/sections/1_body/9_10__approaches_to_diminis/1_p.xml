<p class="p">This section focuses on current health challenges. Specific approaches proposed by the authors to mitigate water-related impacts partly due to climate change for countries comparable to Pakistan include the following: 
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p class="p">Reducing water scarcity and pollution by changing lifestyles of individuals through education and by applying water conservation strategies, rain water harvesting, integrated sustainable water management, as the global water requirement is expected to increase by 55% in 2050. (In Pakistan, the annual water availability was 5260 m
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>/capita in 1951. Due to increasing urbanization and anthropogenic activities, it is expected to be &lt;800 m
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>/capita in 2030. In comparison, the estimated figure is 1066 m
    <sup class="sup">3</sup>/capita in 2015.).

   <p class="p">Improving laws linked to the introduction of missing water valuation, surface water quality impacts due to climate change, groundwater challenges, and pollution control through awareness raising, and implementation of policies regarding water storage, water conservation, integrated water resources management, capacity building, and awareness raising that should be encouraged at various levels by introducing fines to reduce water scarcity and pollution problems should be encouraged [

   <p class="p">Developing new and improved irrigation techniques and strategies (e.g., drip irrigation, site specific irrigation, micro-irrigation and sprinkling), crop rotation, introduction of new crop varieties, alternate crop selection [
    <xref rid="B96-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">96</xref>], as well as applying innovative ideas for risk management, biodiversity enhancement, land and grazing management, water conservation, adaptation, and rehabilitation along with pollution control. Adaptation of strategies like crop management practices along soil fertility and water management are practiced due to a reduced availability of water and associated socio-economic effects [
    <xref rid="B97-ijerph-13-01051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">97</xref>]. Other strategies related to water management in agriculture include tunnel farming, alternate or renewable energy sources, especially pasteurized irrigation systems, gated piped irrigation, and laser land leveling [

   <p class="p">Provision of more funds for research in biotechnology supporting the introduction of specific heat resistant, flood (or drought) tolerant, water efficient, and high yield crop varieties; adaptation of better strategies like water channels to conserve water by minimizing water evaporation and transpiration, water reuse strategies after consuming or using water, dam construction to enable water storage; minimizing the effects of water-related impacts of climate change on agriculture and health; and ensuring both water and food security [

   <p class="p">Involvement of national bodies and key local stakeholders, and securing their active engagement and contributions in adaptation and rehabilitation during and after disasters such as severe floods, earthquakes, heat waves, and storms. Educating farmers may be a considerable challenge when developing strategies to improve crop varieties and better breeds, which are tolerant to adverse climatic conditions like change in temperature, floods, and shift in rainfall patterns—as social barriers may limit the use of feasible measures by farmers [
