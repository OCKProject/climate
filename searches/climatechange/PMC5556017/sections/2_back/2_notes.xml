 <p class="p">J.H. produced the alkyl lipid and supplementary compound-specific isotope data and drafted the main manuscript and the supplementary text (incl. Figures 2 and S1), with substantial support from G.A.W. H.V. carried out the GDGT analyses (TEX
  <sub class="sub">86</sub>), being supervised by S.S., and provided crucial ideas towards the overall interpretation of the multiproxy dataset. V.V. produced the palynological data, K.L. computed Figure 1, while B.W. coordinated coring on Lake Ohrid and provided the samples and vital input on stratigraphy. All authors reviewed the manuscript and contributed intellectually.
