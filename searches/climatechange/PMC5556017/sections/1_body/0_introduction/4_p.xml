<p id="Par5" class="p">Lake level fluctuated substantially over the course of MIS 6 and 5, with evidence for phases of regression and transgression exposing or flooding subaquatic terraces at 12, 30 and 60 m below present-day water depth (Fig.

 </sup> such as the remains of Neolithic pile dwellings behind the modern shoreline in the modern town of Ohrid certainly suggest that lake level was higher than present earlier in the Holocene, shaping the floodplains above modern lake level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B,C</xref>) and this may well have been the case during MIS 5. While Co1202 remained at substantial water depth (currently 145 m) over the course of MIS 6 and 5, parts of the shoreline would have moved closer to the study site, exposing relatively flat surfaces between the lake and the mountain slopes. We demonstrate how it is possible to disentangle the interplay between global climate change, vegetation and soil stock dynamics and how these were influenced by local factors, particularly lake level and morphology.
