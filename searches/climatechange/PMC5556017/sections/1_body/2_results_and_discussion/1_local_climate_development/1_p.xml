 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) indicate a cold MIS 6 in the Ohrid Basin, with warming commencing at ~133 ka. Subsequently, there was a relatively stable and warm climate during the full interglacial conditions of MIS 5e, with a temperature maximum around 124 ka. A return to colder conditions occurred during MIS 5d, with cooling starting between 116 and 115 ka, followed by a somewhat muted warm phase during MIS 5c.
