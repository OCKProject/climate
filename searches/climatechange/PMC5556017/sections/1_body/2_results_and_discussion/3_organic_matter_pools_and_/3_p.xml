<p id="Par15" class="p">Over the following 10,000 years, the supply of degraded soil OM (FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>) and subsurface biomass (ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub>) steadily increased as soils accumulated under forest vegetation. This is illustrated by the decreasing trends in FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub> and ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). There was a gradual decline in oak and increase in pine pollen supply between 128 and 116 ka suggesting vegetation change in response to steady Eemian cooling, as observed in several southern and central European Eemain pollen records

 </sup>. With more severe climate deterioration setting in at 116 ka BP, a significant vegetation change is first indicated by a pulse in pine pollen supply followed by a shift towards substantially higher fir and an equivalent drop in pine pollen supply. From 114.9 ka, soil erosion appeared to increase and substantial amounts of soil OM reached site Co1202 by 113 ka (minimum in ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub>). This is consistent with a significant drop in lake level (inset D in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) bringing the shoreline closer to the site

 </sup> as indicated by the supply of sandy material and eroded former lake sediments from the terrace surfaces that apparently also contributed GDGTs carrying an elevated LST signal from the preceding lake-level highstand (increased TEX
