 </sup>. They show a seesaw-type pattern and bear little resemblance to the LST records, but rather imply abrupt changes in lipid supply from strongly to less degraded soil OM and plant litter followed by gradual increases in the contribution of degraded OM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This pattern suggests a threshold-controlled depositional system that nevertheless responds to continuous climate development, since the abrupt changes in OM supply are, in nearly all cases, associated with either major (MIS 6–5 transition) or minor (C23–25) climate events. Considering the terraced morphology within the catchment of Co1202, lake-level rise would have provided a mechanism for such a pattern of change in OM sources, equivalent to some of the abrupt changes in pollen supply. For example, one of the most pronounced changes in OM quality at phase 2 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, as observed in the ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub> and FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub> profiles, is associated with the beginning and end of the episode of decreased CaCO

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>). The end of phase 2 (~129 ka) is characterised by a switch towards the supply of more litter-type OM, with low amounts of root-derived material (higher ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub>) and less degraded fatty acids (high FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>).
