<p id="Par14" class="p">Given these observations of changing OM quality as indicators of soil erosion, it is possible to synthesise the palynological and geochemical proxy records across the MIS 6–5 transition and to interpret the sediment record. From 140–135.2 ky B.P., pine dominated the catchment of Co1202, perhaps with grassy undergrowth or open grasslands, while steppic vegetation remained in the background (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, inset A). At 135.2 ka, oak habitats began to expand, accompanied by an initial activation of the drainage system as indicated by the pulse of highly degraded soil OM (minimum in FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>) and a stand-alone peak in fir pollen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This is consistent with the continual hydrological change during this period

 </sup> and precedes the rapid rise in temperature starting at 133 ka, at the earliest (increase in CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>). At 133 ka, the pine-dominated habitat on the lowest exposed terrace was drowned (drop in pine pollen), accompanied by transgressive erosion of soils (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>: phase “1”, minimum in ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub>) and resulting in a relative increase in oak, grass and steppic pollen supply. The supply of soil OM and steppic pollen then reduced for about 1,000 years around 129 ka due to a slow-down in transgressive soil erosion (increased CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, ACL
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub> FA, FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>) while lake-level rose across the slope of the next higher terrace and pine successively replaced steppic vegetation (increase in pine pollen, substantial decrease in steppic pollen, small relative decrease in oak pollen). Between 131 and 129 ka, transgressive erosion of more degraded soils from the upper terrace is evident (phase “2”, minima in biomarker proxies and CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>; see inset B in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) that apparently also supplied significant amounts of soil-stored pollen from the former steppic vegetation. By 127.8 ka, the lake level had maximised with all terraces drowned, so plant litter from the slopes became the main source of OM (inset C in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). At this stage, a substantial soil pool on the slopes had not yet developed.
