<p id="Par16" class="p">Following this highly dynamic change, the ecosystem briefly stabilised, with reduced soil erosion (switch to higher ACL FA
 <sub class="sub">22–26</sub> and FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>) and vegetation establishing on the lowest terrace exposed at the time. There were only minor fluctuations in pollen supply between 115 ka and the onset of the C24 cold event after 111 ka even though soil OM supply had changed dramatically during C25, suggesting that soil OM and pollen derived from the same habitats and that the relative proportions of these did not change significantly. The proportions did change over the course of the C24 event and coincided with the supply of slightly more degraded OM, suggesting that a pine-dominated habitat is destabilised. Between C24 and C23, the carbonate record suggests warming towards MIS 5c, while the pollen records and FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub> show a similar pattern as in phase 2 in the MIS 6–5 transition, with a small peak in steppic pollen supply coinciding with a drop in pine pollen supply and an increase in OM degradation. Assuming that lake level was rising, following the lowstand at 113 ka, these fluctuations probably resulted from lake-level controlled habitat modifications. At the end of C23, another rapid change in OM quality and LST is recorded, in a similar way to the development of the MIS 6–5 transition, albeit with lower amplitude and without disruption, which suggests that from 113 to 105 ka lake-level rise may have drowned only one terrace level.
