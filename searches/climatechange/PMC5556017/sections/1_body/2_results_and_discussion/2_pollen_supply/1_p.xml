 </sup>. At the latter, pollen from steppic species and grasses was substantially more abundant (20–40% vs. &lt;10% at Co1202). Thus, the local vegetation cover across the basin seems to have differed; in the southern basin, close to low-lying hills to the southeast (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B</xref>) and south, there may have been areas suitable for steppic vegetation, while the catchment of Co1202 in the northeast featured steep mountain slopes as well as low-lying plains (terrace surfaces/flood plains, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1B,C</xref>) that apparently supported a larger stock of pine.
