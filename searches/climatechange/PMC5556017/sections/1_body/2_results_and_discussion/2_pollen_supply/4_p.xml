<p id="Par12" class="p">The onset of accelerated cooling at the end of the Eemian (116 ka) is marked by abrupt changes in pine and fir pollen supply (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) initially favouring pine, followed by a 30% increase in fir pollen supply which maximised at this time. Whether or not temporarily enhanced PAR at 118–117 ka, which coincides with a drop in fir pollen and enhanced pine pollen supply, are related to an earlier deterioration of the montane habitat is unclear. The onset of a similar change to the one observed at 116 ka, with accelerating cooling and a pulse in pine peak pollen, appears at the end of the record at 99 ka.
