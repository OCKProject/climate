<p id="Par11" class="p">At 133 and 131 ka, two distinct peaks in steppic pollen supply (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>) appear out of phase with the general climatic and basin-wide vegetation development, as they occur during the transition towards warmer and more humid climatic conditions. The first peak appears driven mainly by the reduction in pine pollen supply, as is the concomitant shift towards higher amounts of oak pollen, and coincides with the onset of temperature increase and supply of soil OM (phase 1 in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). The second peak occurs mid-way through the MIS 6–5 transition, where there is clear evidence for substantial soil erosion as indicated by biomarker proxies and the input of siliciclastic material diluting the carbonate (see following chapter). The steppic pollen is therefore likely to be part of the soil fraction re-suspended from an upper terrace surface during lacustrine transgression, while oak and pine pollen derived from the contemporary vegetation cover. The high-amplitude shift in the biomarker and CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> records at 129 ka that indicates a sharp reduction in the supply of degraded soil-derived material coincided with a further drop in pine pollen supply, implying that another source area for the latter had disappeared. It seems, therefore, that 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus</italic> spp. habitats were successively removed from low-lying terrace surfaces close to Co1202 through the rise in lake level during the late MIS 6 and into MIS 5

 </sup>. This led to relatively increased contributions first from steppic vegetation and oaks as the lowermost terrace drowned, with steppic vegetation remaining on the upper terraces and slopes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; phase 1), and then from expanding arboreal vegetation, including pine, and steppic pollen stored in eroding soils as a higher terrace drowned (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; phase 2). Similar sharp changes in pollen composition are associated with phases of lower-amplitude climatic change in the younger record, for example, at the termination of the C23 cold event. This may also be explained by lake-level controlled modifications of the terrestrial habitat that altered the proportion of terrace and floodplain surface area relative to the mountain slopes and, hence, the distribution and relative proportions of associated vegetation. Lake-level change does not appear a factor in the modification of the terrestrial habitat in the Co1202 catchment during the mid and late Eemian, i.e. from 123 to 117 ka, where a gradual decline in oak and increase in pine pollen is apparent, or after ~103 ka (MIS 5c) during the gradual expansion of fir. In both cases, the gradual trends in the pollen records reflect the response of the vegetation towards gradual cooling as indicated by the LST proxies.
