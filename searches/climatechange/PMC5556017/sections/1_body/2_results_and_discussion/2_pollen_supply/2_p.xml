<p id="Par10" class="p">At Co1202, the amount of deciduous and evergreen oak pollen started to rise from about 135 ka (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), with the evergreen species averaging at 5% of the total oak pollen. The onset of this vegetation change was marked by a short-term increase in fir pollen of almost 20%, which caused an equivalent drop in the relative amount of pine pollen, while grass and steppic pollen were absent (sample “x” in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This “event” is characterised by the supply of highly degraded OM (very low FA/OH
 <sub class="sub">25–30</sub>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>; see following chapter) and a distinct peak in the pollen accumulation rate (PAR) and likely results from the re-activation of parts of the drainage system due to higher rainfall, including influx of soil-stored fir pollen. This first significant change in pollen composition led the temperature change as indicated by the LST proxy records (CaCO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, TEX
 <sub class="sub">86</sub>) by almost 2,000 years, but is consistent with recent sedimentological evidence for changes in hydrology and associated lake-level rise occurring throughout the later stages of MIS 6
