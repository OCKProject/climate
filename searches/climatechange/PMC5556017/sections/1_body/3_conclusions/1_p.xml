<p id="Par17" class="p">Records of carbonate precipitation and biomarker-based lake surface water temperature (TEX
 <sub class="sub">86</sub>) reflect the climatic development during the last glacial-interglacial transition and marine isotope stages (MIS) 5c-e (140–99 ka B.P.) at Lake Ohrid and reveal a strong relation to NE Atlantic climate (see Supplementary Material for NE Atlantic isotope record). By contrast, due to the location of sediment core Co1202 and its vicinity to a sequence of extended terrace systems, the records of biomarker composition and pollen supply are to a significant extent shaped by local terrestrial habitat dynamics in the catchment, specifically, the exposure and drowning of terrace surfaces. The distributions of different types of soil cover appear crucial in the supply of OM as reflected in the biomarker records. It appears that the terrace surfaces of the Ohrid Basin allowed forest vegetation to persist through periods of falling lake level in areas with low groundwater depth and stable soil cover, in contrast to the basin as a whole where steppic vegetation expanded to much larger extent during arid climatic conditions. Our approach demonstrates that combining proxies sensitive to vegetation as well as soil pool changes enables detailed reconstruction of terrestrial habitat dynamics and underlines the importance of soils as OM sources to environmental archives.
