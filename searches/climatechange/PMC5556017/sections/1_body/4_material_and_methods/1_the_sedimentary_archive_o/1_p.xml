<p id="Par18" class="p">The sediment sequence of site Co1202 is a 15 m composite record of piston cores taken in 2007 from 145 m water depth in the north-eastern part of Lake Ohrid (41° 5′36.91″N; 20°46′2.93″E) about 2.5 km from the shoreline. The sediments are formed of clayey to sandy silts. The stratigraphy of Co1202 is based on tephrochronology and radiocarbon dates that have been described in detail elsewhere
