<p id="Par20" class="p">Lipid biomarkers were extracted from freeze-dried and homogenised sediment samples by accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) and analysed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS, for GDGTs) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS, for alkyl lipids). For pollen analyses, samples (1â€‰cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup>) with added tablets of 
 <italic class="italic">Lycopodium</italic> spores were treated with HCl (30% v/v) for the removal of carbonates, KOH (10% w/v) for the removal of organic debris, HF (40% v/v) for the removal of silicates followed by acetolysis. Detailed methodologies are given in the Supplementary Material.
