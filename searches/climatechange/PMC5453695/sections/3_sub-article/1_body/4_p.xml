<p class="p">This paper provides results from two substantial meta-analyses about effects of global change on soil nutrients. In the first, response ratios of C, N and P to experimentally simulated precipitation, drought or warming from 182 studies are analyzed (E1). In the second, regression slopes of C, N and P in response to 141 naturally occurring gradients in precipitation, drought or temperature are analyzed (O1). Different responses between experimental (E1) and observational studies (O1) are related to short- vs. long-term effects, but other explanations must also be discussed. In further analyses response ratios from experimental studies are plotted as a function of precipitation or temperature at the different studies sites (E2) and the overall response across all observational studies is analyzed as a function of temperature, precipitation, aridity, soil and ecosystem type (O2). If included in the paper, these further analyses must be fully discussed.</p>
