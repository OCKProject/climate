<p class="p">1) A major point is the comparison between experimental and observational studies. These differ for principal reasons that should be outlined in the introduction, for example referring to similar comparisons in the area of biodiversity-productivity relationships or invasion-biodiversity relationships. Comparisons in these two areas have also sometimes found contrasting responses that could be related to different cause-effects relationships. For the present manuscript, time scale is one among several potential reasons for the differences between observational and experimental studies. For example, we do not know whether experimental studies of much longer duration would lead to response patterns that are more similar to those from observational studies. A caveat of the observational studies used in the meta-analysis is that often they may not have been designed as climate change studies, allowing potential confounding effects to influence results. Perhaps the most striking one would be the change of the vegetation composition along gradients (e.g. if legumes come in this could affect soil N irrespective of precipitation, drought or temperature). This caveat should be mentioned along with the potential confounding effects which might be as important as the difference in time-scale between experimental and observational studies. In this context, it is clear that experimental studies give more consistent results than observational studies.</p>
