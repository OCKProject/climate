<p class="p">There is one major point that we are still struggling with, and, apparently, some of your co-authors do as well. It is what we referred to previously as the across-study analyses E2 and O2. It is not clear how you compare them in the paragraphs that are marked yellow in the main text and in the many supplements (not marked). E2 analyzes effects of variation between experimental studies in site temperature and precipitation on response ratios of nutrient concentrations found between treatment and control within the different individual studies. In contrast, O2 analyzes effects of between â€“ plus within-study variation in site temperature and precipitation on values of nutrient concentrations. It would be possible to use the sites of the experimental studies as an observational gradient and analyze values of nutrient concentrations found at these sites, without reference to the experiments. I am not sure if this was done, but it would probably not make much sense. Another, more sensible possibility, which was not done, would be to analyze the variation between observational studies in site temperature and precipitation on slopes of nutrient concentrations against climatic variables within the different individual studies. This would then be comparable with E2.</p>
