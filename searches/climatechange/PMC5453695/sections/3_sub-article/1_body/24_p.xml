<p class="p">Please make sure you check if the aridity index in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> is the same as the aridity gradient used in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. We think this is not the case and very confusing. If necessary, you should "reverse" the x-axis in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figures 6</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">7</xref> by using the same measure as in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3" class="xref">Figure 3</xref>. Like this the soil nutrients will be negatively correlated with decreased water supply as they should (you write in the Results "Soil N and P concentrations decreased with increasing aridity…").
