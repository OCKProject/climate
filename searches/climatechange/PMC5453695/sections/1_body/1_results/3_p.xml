<p class="p">Cross-study analyses found that response ratios varied between experimental studies along climatic gradients. The response ratio of soil C concentration increased quadratically with mean annual precipitation in water-addition experiments, but decreased non-significantly with precipitation in drought experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). The response ratios of N and P concentrations in manipulative precipitation experiments were not significantly correlated with mean annual precipitation. The response ratio of P concentration in drought experiments decreased with precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" class="xref">Figure 5</xref>). This relationship, however, was mainly dependent on two data points (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.01, p=0.84). The response ratio of C concentration in warming experiments was linearly correlated with mean annual temperature. Unimodal curves best described the relationships between the response ratio of N and P concentrations in warming experiments and mean annual temperature. At low to moderate levels, mean annual temperature increased the response ratio of P concentrations.
