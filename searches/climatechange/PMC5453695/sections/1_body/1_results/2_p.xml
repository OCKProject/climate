<p class="p">Responses to changes in temperature also differed between experimental and observational studies. Experimental warming generally increased the concentrations of C, N, and P, especially that of N (

Similar results were found for temperature-related changes in C, N, and P concentrations across different types of ecosystems or soils: patterns were inconsistent between manipulative experiments and environmental gradient observations for the same climate-change factor of precipitation or temperature (
