<p class="p">In the cross-study analyses of all observational studies, climatic data (temperature and precipitation) collectively explained ~30% of the variation in soil total C, N, and P concentrations. Soil and ecosystem types were also strong drivers of total C, N, and P concentrations. When all data were included, the variables of climate, aridity, and type of ecosystem and soil accounted for ~63–77% of the variation observed in the C, N, and P concentrations (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Soil C, N and P concentrations, based on all observations from the observational studies, changed quadratically with mean annual precipitation and temperature (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>). Both C and N concentration were significantly and positively correlated with mean annual precipitation but negatively correlated to aridity. Soil P was negatively correlated with precipitation but was not significantly correlated with the aridity. Soil C, N and P were quadratically correlated to with temperature. Similar but clearer patterns were found between soil nutrients and climate variables when only considering the controls from all experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref>). Soil P concentrations increased at low level of precipitation but decreased at high level of precipitation. Neither C nor N were significantly correlated with precipitation. In contrast, soil C, especially N and P, significantly decreased with aridity. Soil C and N were negatively correlated with temperature but soil P was positively correlated with temperature.
