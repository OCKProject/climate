<p class="p">Contrasting responses of soil total C, N, and P concentrations were found between experimental and observational studies. The responses of soil total C, N, and P concentrations generally differed between paired manipulative experiments and environmental gradients (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1" class="xref">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, adding water in experiments decreased soil N, P, and C concentrations by 5.4, 9.3, and 2.7%, respectively (non-significantly for C). In contrast, N concentration increased with precipitation across environmental gradients. The enhanced effects of increasing precipitation on C and P concentrations were not significant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figure 2</xref>). Experimental drought treatments significantly increased the concentrations of C, N, and P by 6.1, 17.9, and 6.8%, respectively. Soil N and P concentrations decreased with increasing aridity and C concentration did not change significantly when precipitation was replaced by aridity. The aridity-related patterns were opposite to those observed in manipulative drought experiments (
