<p class="p">For the observational studies, we calculated the response of the soil C, N, and P concentrations across precipitation or temperature gradients by estimating the changes in C, N, and P concentrations for each study based on the slopes of the regression lines for the C, N, and P concentrations and precipitation or temperature from a simple linear model. The slopes were then analyzed using a mixed-effects model, with region as a random effect to account for geographic clustering of the study sites. The CI of the resulting grand-mean slope was calculated by parametric bootstrapping using the

We could predict the direction and magnitude of an effect with 95% CI error bars based on the parametric bootstrap. The effects of increased/decreased precipitation and temperature on soil minerals could be considered significant if the 95% CI did not overlap zero.
