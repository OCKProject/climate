<p class="p">The data set included 182 experimental precipitation/warming studies and 141 studies (including the two own studies mentioned above) of natural precipitation/temperature gradients from around the world (Supplementary References). We used WorldClim (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Hijmans et al., 2005</xref>) to get temperature/precipitation data for 1950–2000 using the R package ‘
 <italic class="italic">raster</italic>’ based on the latitude and longitude of the sites. We used MAT and MAP in our analyses because they could be both derived from WorldClim, whereas climate data for individual growing seasons of various regions were not available. We also used aridity for our modeling, because aridity across large temperature gradients incorporates both potential evapotranspiration and precipitation and is thus more meaningful than precipitation alone. The aridity index (AI) is the ratio of MAP to mean annual potential evapotranspiration (MAE). MAP values were obtained from WorldClim. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) layers were estimated based on monthly averages from Global-PET (

The AI decreases as aridity increases and is generally correlated with climatic characters such as rainfall and temperature. To facilitate the interpretation of our results, we substituted the AI by aridity, estimated as [maximum AI in the data set – AI], which increases with decreasing MAP (

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> = 0.68, p&lt;0.001). Aridity, as a negative substitute for AI, had an opposite relationship, i.e. AI was positively correlated with MAP, with the same

 <sup class="sup">2</sup> and 
 <italic class="italic">P</italic> value. Aridity might be more appropriate than precipitation for the observational gradients in which temperature also varies. This index, however, is not suitable for manipulative experiments in which it does not vary accordingly. Given that the purpose of our analyses was to identify the similarities and differences of responses to precipitation and temperature between observational gradients and manipulative experiments, we chose precipitation over aridity for the comparison of experimental studies. Soil types, classified using the FAO-UNESCO classification system, were derived from the Harmonized World Soil Database version 1.21 released in 2012 by the FAO (
