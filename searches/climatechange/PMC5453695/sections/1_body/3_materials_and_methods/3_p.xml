<p class="p">All meta-data were extracted from the text, tables, figures, and appendices of the original publications. When data were presented graphically, numerical data were extracted with Image-Pro Plus 7.0 (Media Cybernetics, Inc., Rockville, MD, USA). Measurements from different ecosystem types and treatment levels within a study were considered as independent observations. Different sites within the same study have the same climate, so the results from different sites within each study are not independent. We deal with the lack of independence following the approach of 
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Vilà et al. (2011)</xref> who compared the results of the analysis of the complete database with those from the analyses of a reduced database formed by one randomly selected data point per experimental study, or geographic location in the case of multisite studies. All data can be confidently included in the analysis if mean effect sizes are similar and the bias-corrected 95% bootstrap confidence interval (CI) overlaps between the complete and reduced databases. This approach has been successfully applied in many ecological meta-analyses (e.g.
