<p class="p">The studies included in our meta-analysis were identified by searching the databases of the Institute for Scientific Information’s Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar, and JSTOR for 1945–2015 using combinations of the following keywords: ‘manipulative experiment’, ‘soil carbon/nitrogen/phosphorus’, ‘climate change’, and ‘gradient’ (a list of the selected studies is presented in the Supplementary References). Criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis for manipulative experiments included (1) a report of at least one variable of soil C/N/P concentration in both manipulated and control groups, (2) the ability to calculate, the mean, standard deviation and sample size of reported C/N/P concentrations, and (3) the study was conducted in natural or semi-natural ecosystems (i.e. only non-agricultural ecosystems). The criteria for the gradient studies included (1) a report of differences in C/N/P concentration, and (2) data derived from field investigations, excluding data from studies in which environmental factors were manipulated or controlled. Only studies that reported total C, N, or P concentration using similar techniques of chemical analyses were included in our meta-analysis. We chose the data for which C concentration was determined by dichromate-acid digestion, N concentration was measured by the Kjeldahl method, and P concentration was determined colorimetrically (
