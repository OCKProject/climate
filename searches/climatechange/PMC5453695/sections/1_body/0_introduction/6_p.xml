<p class="p">No study, to the best of our knowledge, has directly tested the congruence of soil nutrient responses to changing regimes of precipitation or temperature obtained from experimental

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> and Supplementary References). We evaluated the similarity of the predictions from experimental and observational approaches by assessing the direction of the responses of soil nutrients to changing precipitation/temperature. Further analyses were conducted to compare the response ratios from experimental studies to changes in precipitation or temperature at the various study sites with the overall response across all observational studies as a function of precipitation, aridity and temperature. We used total nutrient concentrations because they represent long-term nutrient reservoirs in terrestrial ecosystems and are more stable than extractable nutrients in soils. Total C, N, and P concentrations generally indicate overall nutrient availability and are positively correlated with each other (
