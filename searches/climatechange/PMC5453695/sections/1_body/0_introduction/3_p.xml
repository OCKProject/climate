<p class="p">Soils are intricately linked to the atmospheric climate system through biogeochemical and hydrological cycles (

 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Williams, 1987</xref>), hence any change in climate is expected to influence soil characteristics and vice versa. Research in the last two decades has suggested various ways in which climate change will impact soil processes and properties, with critical consequences for the biogeochemical cycles of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) (

 <xref rid="bib79" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">van Groenigen et al., 2006</xref>). The direction and magnitude of these impacts largely depend on changes in precipitation and temperature, which are key drivers of biogeochemical cycles. The results from these studies, however, may vary greatly depending on whether the data are from observational or experimental studies (

Determining the nature of the responses of nutrient cycling to drivers of climate change identified by the two approaches is essential to accurately forecast the impacts of climate change on the availability of soil C, N, and P from local to global scales, and thusÂ their potential impacts on ecosystem structure and functioning.
