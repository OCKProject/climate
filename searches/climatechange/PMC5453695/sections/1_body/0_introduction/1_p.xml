<p class="p">Shifts in patterns of precipitation and increases in temperature are two major components of ongoing climate change (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">IPCC, 2014</xref>). Manipulative experiments (e.g. field/mesocosm) and observational studies constitute the main empirical approaches typically used to forecast ecological responses to climate change (

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Snecdecor and Cochran, 1989</xref>). The major difference between these approaches is likely the issue of association versus causation; observational studies randomly select a sample of subjects and may find correlations between variables (

 <xref rid="bib92" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>). In comparison, experimental studies can identify and confirm the potential mechanisms underlying observed responses by controlling any variable (

 <xref rid="bib78" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Tilman, 1989</xref>). If an experimental study is well-controlled, the factor that causes the difference can be reliably identified. In contrast, all confounding factors cannot be ruled out in observational studies.
