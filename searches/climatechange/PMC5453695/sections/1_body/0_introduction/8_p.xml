<p class="p">As stated above, the contrasting findings between manipulative experiments and observational studies may be due to the timescale, because the former have typically been performed at short temporal scales in relatively homogeneous environments to maximize experimental control, whereas the latter have usually been established over largely spatial gradients that reflect long-term adjustments of ecosystems to local climate (
