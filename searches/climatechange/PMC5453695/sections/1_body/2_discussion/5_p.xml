<p class="p">Differences between observational and experimental studies evaluating biodiversity–productivity relationships could be understandable because the artificial selection of component species in short-term manipulative experiments can lead to a ‘sampling’ or ‘positive selection’ effect, whereby randomly selecting a more productive species is more likely in more diverse treatments (

Similarly, the contrasting patterns we found between observational and experimental studies might be because climate change tends to have a direct and simple effect on soil nutrients in the relatively homogenous environments that characterize small-scale manipulative experiments conducted at a single field site, but the direct and simple effect tends to be overwhelmed by the environmental heterogeneity (e.g. spatial variation in soil nutrient concentration) that characterizes large-scale observational studies. The hypothesis of environmental heterogeneity proposed in conceptual models for biodiversity–productivity relationships (
