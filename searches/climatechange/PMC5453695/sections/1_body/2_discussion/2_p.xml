<p class="p">It is increasingly clear that precipitation provoked by climate change will alter nutrient cycles, although these responses induced by rainfall may vary among ecosystems and soils (

The increased water availability with higher rainfall boosts microbial activity and plant-nutrient uptake, and hence nutrient cycling. In contrast, a drier climate reduces microbial nutrient uptake but increases the availability of soil nutrient, leading to an accumulation of nutrients. This higher nutrient pool in soil, however, may increase the risk of nutrient loss by leaching or erosion, leading to a short- to middle-term nutrient impoverishment (

 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Ramos and Mart√≠nez-Casasnovas, 2004</xref>). The decrease in soil N and P concentrations we found in manipulative precipitation experiments can thus be attributed to changes in the balance between nutrient inputs (e.g. litter decomposition) and outputs (e.g. leaching and emission of gases to the atmosphere) (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">Brown et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, adding water can stimulate plant growth, particularly in drylands, and can thereby lead to increased sequestration of nutrients in plant biomass, which could be another mechanism for the decrease in soil N and P concentrations observed in water-addition experiments.
