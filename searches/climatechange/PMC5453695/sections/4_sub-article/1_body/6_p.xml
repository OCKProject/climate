However, these cross-study analyses have to be better introduced and justified. Again, you should suggest specific hypotheses and then interpret the results along those hypotheses. In the manuscript, you should make it clear when which analyses are being presented: E1 (response ratios), E2 (variation in response ratios across studies), O1 (regression slopes for single gradients), O2 (regressions across studies) all in the Materials and methods section and Results section.</p>
