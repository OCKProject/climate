<p class="p">As you mentioned for the two approaches, neither is a perfect surrogate for climate change. We cannot say which is right or wrong. Different approaches just tell us different things and we need to do a better job of laying those out, e.g. when and where each approach may be informative. Experiments may tell us short-term responses (years to decades) prior to coincident shifts in plant or microbial composition which may counteract the short-term responses; so these may be better for predicting responses given our current plants and soils; observational gradients may better tell us what happens over a longer time frame when multiple aspects of the system have had a chance to adjust. According to your suggestion, we have changed the title and added more discussion (Discussion paragraphs five and seven) in this revised version.</p>
