 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" class="xref">Figure 1</xref> should be simplified or omitted. As it stands there are many potential problems with this figure and several arrows could be added or reversed. For example, where an arrow goes from photosynthesis to plant growth, this implies that it is the process of photosynthesis that is affected by temperature and water availability, and that this then affects plant growth. Physiologists have known for a long time that growth is far more sensitive to water availability and temperature than photosynthesis is. Photosynthesis responds, because it is affected by growth (feedback). The way the link is presented between the two processes is fundamentally wrong, but it is also not relevant for your paper to include photosynthesis and stomatal activity in the figure because you do not talk about it. Additionally, many other compartments without further use in the paper could be combined. What do you mean by "Other climates"?
