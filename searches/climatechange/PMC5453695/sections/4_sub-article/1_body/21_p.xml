<p class="p">This point is unclear for us. We are not sure if you want us to study slopes in observations of each site, i.e., calculate the slope of nutrient concentration relative to temperature and precipitation range within each site, and then plot these slopes versus the corresponding temperature and precipitation of each site. However, for spatially observational studies, there is only one observation at each site, i.e., only one 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> value for each 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> value at each site. Therefore, it is impossible to calculate slope at each site. Similarly, we can't get a slope at each site for experimental studies. We have instead calculated the slopes for different individual observational studies (not for each site) along the corresponding environmental gradients. That is to say, there is one slope for one gradient observation along several climate data for one study. We got various slopes from different individual studies and used 
 <italic class="italic">bootMer</italic> in 
 <italic class="italic">lme4</italic> package to get a grand-mean slope, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" class="xref">Figures 2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4" class="xref">4</xref>. The overall slope, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6" class="xref">Figure 6</xref>, can be drawn by using all data from all studies for all sites. We are not sure if you mean that the slope of the relationship between climate and nutrients does not work for quadratic relationships. In that case, we have calculated the Spearman correlation between climate and nutrients in order to reduce your concern. We will be happy to test any other relationship you had in mind for us not fully test.
