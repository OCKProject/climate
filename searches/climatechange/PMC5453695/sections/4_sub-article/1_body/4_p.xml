<p class="p">To better justify that the contrasting results between E1 and O1 may indeed be due to different time-scales and not to the problem of reversed causalities or third variables in observational studies, you should provide focused hypotheses for E1 and O1. Rather than hypothesizing "that different mechanisms are involved", you should suggest those mechanisms and back these suggestions up with references. You should then come back to these mechanisms and discuss them in more detail in the Discussion, using/reviewing for example what the authors of those studies that entered the meta-analysis had suggested.</p>
