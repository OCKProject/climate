<p class="p">The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined in the track changes and comments in the attached version. We agree that it is not necessary anymore to analyze the slopes as a function of mean climatic variables of the observational studies. Instead it is fine to simply present the overall multiple regressions. It is also not necessary to show Spearman rank correlation results and we have deleted those parts. However, we think it makes sense to add 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" class="xref">Figure 7</xref> because it actually strengthens your case, in particular because it shows the declines of C and N with MAT better than does the overall analysis of the observational studies.
