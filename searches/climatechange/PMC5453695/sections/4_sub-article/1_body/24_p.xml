<p class="p">Relating to the previous two paragraphs, we suggest that you remove most of your supplementary material because it does not add to your main message and only confuses those who might actually look at this material. What is much more important is that you provide the data in an easily accessible way so that interested readers can recreate themselves such material as you wanted to present in the supplementary material.</p>
