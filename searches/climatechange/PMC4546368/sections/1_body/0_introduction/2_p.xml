<p class="p">According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment report, humans are “very likely” (90-100% probability) to be responsible for the increased warming of our planet [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>], and this anthropogenic global warming is responsible for certain weather extremes [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]. In April 2013, 63% of Americans reported that they believe climate change is happening. This number, however, drops to 49% when asked if climate change is being caused by humans. The percentage drops again to 38% when asked if people around the world are currently being harmed by the consequences of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]. These beliefs and risk perceptions can vary by state or by county [
 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. By contrast, 97% of active, publishing, climate change scientists agree that “human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures” [

 <xref rid="pone.0136092.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Coordination among journalists, policy actors, and scientists will help to improve reporting on climate change, by engaging the general public and creating a more informed decision-making process [
