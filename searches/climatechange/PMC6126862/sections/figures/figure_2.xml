  <p class="p">(a) Simplified schematic of the life cycle of an organism described by Model 1. The environmental fluctuations in fecundity may be described by Eq (A7), a constant plus or minus 
   <italic class="italic">an environmental perturbation</italic>. However, for survival the environment intrudes through the probability of a given individual dying within a given time-frameâ€”the environment intrudes in a multiplicative way. (b) Dynamics of the total population of the organism. In general, the depth of oscillation will be greater for Type III organisms.
