  <title class="title">High mortality of early life stages and increased environmental autocorrelation have a combined effect that increases relative population variance.</title>
  <p class="p">In order to study the effect of autocorrelation we find the variance of the log-population as a function of first year survival (
   <italic class="italic">s</italic>
   <sub class="sub">0</sub>) and autocorrelation coefficient 
   <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> of environmental variability. Here the variance of 
   <italic class="italic">δ</italic>
   <sub class="sub">
    <italic class="italic">t</italic>
   </sub> is chosen such that the variance of 
   <italic class="italic">ε</italic>
   <sub class="sub">
    <italic class="italic">t</italic>
   </sub> is exactly 0.1 for the duration of model time. For each set of parameters, in 500 replicate simulations we ran a Leslie matrix model for 250 years of model time. For each replicate we found the variance of log-population and plot the average of this over 500 replicate simulations. We run these simulations across 10 values of 
   <italic class="italic">s</italic>
   <sub class="sub">0</sub> (0.0001 to 0.5, exponential scale) and 9 values of 
   <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> (0 to 0.8, linear scale). Onto the contour map of the simulation results, we place silhouettes of populations from 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> based on their 
   <italic class="italic">s</italic>
   <sub class="sub">0</sub> value and the calculated 
   <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> of their environment. The latter is determined from the dominant oceanographic index native to their population region (see Appendix F in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203124.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The greater sensitivity to environmental forcing seen for Type III populations is thus exacerbated by the environment itself, such that regions with more pronounced environmental memory will force even greater variability to these populations.
