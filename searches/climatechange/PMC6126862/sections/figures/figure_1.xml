  <title class="title">Three life history types expressed in terms of abundance and survival over time.</title>
  <p class="p">Type I populations (top panel) that are characterized by low fecundity, high survival, longer life span, with reproductive senescence. Type III (bottom panel) populations are characterized by high fecundity, low juvenile survival, with increasing survival of later age classes. Type II populations (middle panel) are an intermediary form with relatively constant survival throughout all age classes. Dotted lines represent juvenile stages; solid lines begin at the earliest onset of breeding. Lines from bordering panels are retained as faint grey lines for reference. Both abundance and lifespan proportion are normalized and used to find the metric 
   <italic class="italic">A</italic> of life-history type (see Appendix B in 
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203124.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). The average inverse survival to maturity is for the three types are 1.5, 6.3 and 84,000 respectively).
