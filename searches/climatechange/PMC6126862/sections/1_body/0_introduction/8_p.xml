<p class="p">This paper thus focuses on individual fecundity and the patterns of mortality prior to reproduction and how these determine the response of populations to environmental variability. We use the classical scheme introduced by Pearl [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref046" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">46</xref>] that distinguishes species according to their survival curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). These range from “Type I” where parents invest most of their reproductive energy in safeguarding offspring, so that mortality is low in the early stages of life through to “Type III” populations which invest most of the energy in maximizing fecundity but where immature individuals experience extreme mortality. “Type II” strategies lie intermediate, involving relatively constant mortality throughout life. By using a modelling approach, we show that as we move away from a Type I and towards Type III survival strategy, population variability increasingly reflects environmental variation, especially that in earlier life stages.
