<p class="p">In conservation terms, what is the difference between organisms like seals on the one hand and organisms like fungi on the other, and in which group do sea turtles belong? In both cases, the underlying issue is whether climate change can be expected to be the main influence and at which stage of the life-cycle is this influence greatest. Is it the extreme fecundity of fungi (a single fruiting body may release billions or even trillions of spores) that makes them apparently insensitive to removal of individuals, but sensitive to habitat changes? It is our contention that the crucial difference lies in each organismsâ€™ strategy as embodied in their survival curve, where there is a symmetry between mortality and fecundity (high fecundity implies high mortality and vice versa). It is this symmetry in birth rates and death rates that determines the kind of analysis required and the kind of management strategy for conservation that should be pursued. We will argue that organisms with high fecundity have a fundamentally different response from organisms such as seals and elephants and hence different conservation requirements.</p>
