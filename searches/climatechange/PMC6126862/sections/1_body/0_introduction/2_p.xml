<p class="p">Much of the current effort to forecast the ecological effects of climate change is habitat or niche based. A popular approach is to consider climate envelopes and how their changes will affect species distributions. Within these envelopes, populations of organisms operate in their ecological niche, yet outside of these envelopes they fail to thrive [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. As a result, there are many studies on shifts in geographic distributions, poleward or upslope migrations, phenological mismatches, and the collective effects of these shifts to trophic dynamics [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. In the above approaches, population dynamics and organism life history traits tend to be ignored, although recently there has been a drive to include more demography into species distribution models [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref018" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">18</xref>]. By contrast, in conservation biology population dynamics usually plays a major role. Classic textbooks and various packages are available to explore the dynamics of specific populations with and without age structure [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]. These approaches tend to emphasize counts of breeding adults (often of birds and mammals) while diminishing that of environmental variability. In fisheries science, explicit links between demographics and environmental factors are more commonly employed and environmental variability is understood to play a significant role in population dynamics, primarily through the well-documented mechanisms of somatic growth and recruitment of juveniles into the population [
