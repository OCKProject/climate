<p class="p">Much has been said about life history and how it determines organisms’ response to environmental variation. There is a vast corpus of ecological theory dedicated to this issue. The organisms’ response depends on many things: longevity [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>], generation time [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>], demographic dispersion [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>], demographic versus environmental noise amplitude [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], noise correlation [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>], non-stationary noise [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref038" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">38</xref>] and many other things, including combinations of the above. Attempts to model the effect of climatic changes often focus on specific types, such mammals or birds [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref039" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref041" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">41</xref>] or plant populations regulated by density dependence [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref016" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">16</xref>] but insights gained can be extended to more general situations. Nevertheless, in this great wealth of literature, we found relatively little on the specific role of fecundity. In fisheries science, the issue has been recognized as important in the “recruitment problem” (i.e. why is recruitment so variable?) leading to possible problems in the context of conservation [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref042" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">42</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref044" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. However, the large-scale studies such as those by Mertz &amp; Myer [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref043" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>] or Rickman et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref045" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">45</xref>] tend to consider commercially important stock species which fall disproportionately on the high fecundity end in the range 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> to 10
 <sup class="sup">6</sup> (offspring per female over the individual’s lifetime?) Despite this wide range, the absence of low fecundities in the range 1 to 10
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> is a major limitation since much of the crucial differences in strategy fall within this range. The treatment of this parameter in the terrestrial literature is even more cursory. This shows that a greater focus on fecundity is needed.
