<p class="p">The second concerns the relative influence of harvesting and environmental disturbance on the sustainability of fungi. Wild-mushroom collecting is an important activity in many countries and sustainability is obviously an important consideration. For this reason, often there are calls to limit the collection or harvesting of wild mushrooms. However, recent work investigating the effects of sustained harvesting unexpectedly found that the intensity of harvesting itself had little effect but that harvest-related damage to the immediate environment could have serious effects on subsequent yields [

This suggests that removing individuals causes a smaller impact on fungi production/availability than does damage to the surrounding environment. Such a result goes strongly against the intuition of most conservation biologists. Nevertheless, these results have been reproduced [
