 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> illustrates these different strategies for a number of real organisms. In it we normalized both abundance and lifespan survival rates in order to compare different strategies employed in the lifetime survival profiles for a variety of organisms. On the vertical axis, data range from the initial maximum at 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> (cohort production) down to the last individual, scaled by 
 <italic class="italic">n</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = ln(
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>). The horizontal axis is normalized relative to the maximum lifespan. For Type I species we observe a low mortality rate for early life stages followed by a stable mortality rate plateau until senescence when survival drops rapidly (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1A</xref>). For type II, there is a more or less exponential decline in numbers. Type III species suffer rapid loss in early life followed by slower loss as adults. In this evolutionary wager, high mortality rates in the early life-stages are offset by the sheer numbers of offspring. An additional evolutionary payoff is that natural selection acts quickly. (Note that the evolutionary progression runs from Type III to Type I with the development of traits such as endothermy, live birth, parental care and social behaviour.) Type-III has sometimes been referred to an 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>-strategy (referring to how the intrinsic per-capita rate of increase, 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>, is maximized) in contrast to the 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>-strategy of Type I. However, these terms have fallen under scrutiny (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref049" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">49</xref>]) and are no longer popular. All data are from published studies [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref064" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">64</xref>]. One of the aims of this figure is to compare a large sample of such strategies, so as to span the evolutionary tree. However, it is obvious that there exist more extreme Type III species. Fungi have fecundity that may be measured in billions or even trillions [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref065" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref066" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">66</xref>].
