<p class="p">The survival strategy can be quantified through various metrics. Often these may involve three or more parameters that often target specific taxonomic groups such as plants [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref067" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">67</xref>] or fish [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref068" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">68</xref>]. One-parameter metrics are much cruder but may capture common patterns across taxonomic groups. Such metrics include, for example, the inverse proportion of individuals that reach the reproductive phase

 <sub class="sub">m</sub>
 <sup class="sup">-1</sup>, or the mortality rate in the first year, or 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub>, or adult fecundity, or steepness. A measure using the relative area subtended by the survival curve above or below the diagonal in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref> is described in Appendix B in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203124.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>. In this paper we will be concentrating mainly on the mortality rate 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> and on adult fecundity, which, as we shall argue, are closely related to one another. Fecundity ranges a million-fold in nature across the organisms we consider. We show that survival curves affect the gains of different conservation actions and so we argue that it should be a more central feature of practical and urgent conservation decisions for commercially-exploited and protected species.
