<p class="p">Two specific examples have motivated our interest in this question. The first is a recent debate about protected species management, on the influences of climate variability to marine turtle populations. Underscoring the role of climate to juvenile recruitment, Van Houtan &amp; Halley [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>] predicted 25 time series of loggerhead sea turtle (
 <italic class="italic">Caretta caretta</italic>) nesting populations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans using hatch year and breeding year climate indices. In response, Arendt et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>] argued that loggerhead nesting numbers in the Atlantic could be modelled using only contemporary climate indices, thus giving negligible environmental influence to juvenile recruitment. Then, Ascani et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref029" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">29</xref>] demonstrated ocean circulation dynamics vary decadally and have dramatic influences on ecosystem productivity, neonate survival, and likely explain observed loggerhead nesting trends. These issues are particularly relevant for protected sea turtle populations, where quantifying the relative influence of bottom-up (ecosystem) and top-down (e.g., fisheries bycatch) forces informs decisions about the effectiveness of various conservation and management strategies [
