<p class="p">The survival curve plays a major role in an organismâ€™s sensitivity to climatic variability, especially the distinction between Type I, II and III strategies. It is often supposed that Type I organisms will be most vulnerable to climate change. However, the regime predicted by climate models features not just directional global warming but also increasing climate variance. Our simplified analysis suggests that Type III organisms are likely to be most sensitive to this kind of variability and hence more vulnerable and also that the effectiveness of a specific conservation action depends upon the life-history type. In particular the massive mortalities at early stages intrinsic to Type III species create special sensitivity to environmental variability that is reflected at the population level. Thus, in prioritizing conservation actions, we should treat Type III organisms differently from Type I organisms. While the most effective conservation actions for Type I populations is to avoid killing them, for Type III populations (with high fecundity and low parental investment), conservation goals should focus on protecting early life stages from hostile environments.</p>
