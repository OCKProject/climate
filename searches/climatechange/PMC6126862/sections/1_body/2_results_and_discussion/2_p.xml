 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>]), where variability of mortality is high in the early stages, although nonlinear phenomena need to be included to understand fully what’s going on. This model also shows (via Eq (A16)) that stages having larger mortality contribute more variability to population fluctuations. Similarly, Eq (A17) shows that shorter-duration classes with similar mortality contribute more variability. This is consistent with the findings of others [
