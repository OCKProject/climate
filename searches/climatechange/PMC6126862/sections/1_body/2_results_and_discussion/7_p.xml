<p class="p">It can be argued that as far as population viability analysis (PVA) is concerned, we do understand the population recovery of Type I organisms. These organisms are sensitive to direct exploitation but resilient to many types of environmental changes. In fact environmental factors are often entirely omitted from PVAs published in conservation journals, considering mainly population dynamics, demographic stochasticity and exploitation mortality. However, the road to recovery for Type III organisms remains mysterious and occluded. It is obvious that Type III organisms pay for any large resilience to harvesting and rapid evolution between generations through a greater vulnerability to environmental variability. Yet, we cannot ignore the dangers of overharvesting even for very high values of fecundity. Numerous conservation failures for Type III organisms show the dangers of betting on high fecundity [

The sustained depression at low populations suffered by such high-fecundity Type III organisms continues to be an unresolved population-dynamics problem as well as a conservation problem [
