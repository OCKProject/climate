 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> can also be turned around. Although all the interventions of 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> are in the form of a boost, we can show exactly analogous behaviour if there are negative impacts, such as pollution or hunting. Type III organisms with high fecundity must also have high mortality rates which by Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0203124.e004" class="xref">4</xref>) implies greater sensitivity to environmental variations. However, the message of 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> is that while Type I organisms (that take a long time to replace themselves) will be sensitive to removal of adults (or nest equivalents), Type III organisms enjoy greater resilience to overharvesting compared to environmental variability. For example, for fungi, which have extreme Type III life cycles, our model predicts that mortality in the adult population (e.g. through harvesting) will have much less effect on future populations than environmental damage that impacts fecundity (or survival to early life stages) (e.g. habitat damage associated with harvesting). Greater sensitivities have been highlighted in bold. It is worth noting that the leatherback sea-turtle has the same pattern as the bass and the conch but is very different from the orca. This shows that in conservation terms, sea turtles may be more suitably identified with type III organisms than with sea-mammals or other type I organisms.
