<p class="p">Studies show such negative and chronic population pressures—whether environmental or anthropogenic—may make populations more variable and more susceptible to environmental variability. Under persistent suboptimal environmental conditions, for example, compensation may weaken and we see Type I populations exhibit survival curves more resembling Type II or even Type III populations. This has been separately documented in geographically distinct populations of Steller sea lion (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1B</xref>), a century earlier perhaps may have more of a Type I population form. Elevated juvenile mortality in this seabird population has been linked in recent years to commercial fisheries [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. An analysis of ichthyoplankton data from the California Current System showed that fishing increases temporal variability of populations [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref085" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">85</xref>], and subsequent analysis found that this was caused by increased instability in population dynamics [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. In this setting, the challenge to managers would then be to restore natural life history forms (in this case, factors contributing to increasing juvenile survival at-sea) but not to fundamentally alter the native life history patterns themselves. Populations at equilibrium, for example, might also exhibit different patterns than those increasing or decreasing in abundance.
