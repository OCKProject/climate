<p class="p">Are species inherently fixed in their life history types? Canonical examples of Type I populations (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>) are associated with the traits of low fecundity, strong parental investment, highly evolved social structure, and considerable behavioural complexity. These traits together mitigate the direct impacts of environmental variability to survival. Type III populations, by contrast, without such traits are more easily influenced by environmental variability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>). However, systemic and persistent pressures could increase mortality at certain life stages, for all life history strategy types, depressing the survival curve from its typical form.
