<p class="p">Life history strategy determines the effectiveness of conservation actions. 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> shows the “conservation gain” resulting from nine different conservation actions for five different species, according to Model-2. We have chosen the magnitudes of the different actions to yield the same gain for the only type-II species in the set, the wandering albatross. We see that for the type-I species (the orca), the most effective action is to increase juvenile survival whereas for the three type-III organisms the most effective action is to reduce mortality in the earliest stage. This shows that the most beneficial conservation actions for type-I populations are not the best for type-III populations. Also, Type I species respond relatively uniformly to different conservation actions. (We have not included in our calculations that Type I organisms having behavioural plasticity might be further buffered against environmental variability.) Differences in conservation outcomes are more pronounced for Type III organisms. Secondly, for the Type III organisms in the table, it is changes in survival early on that can lead to major changes in gain. Simulations also revealed that variance in conservation gain is greater for Type III organisms, so it is more difficult to forecast the degree of success for such populations. Sea turtle populations have been modelled using a variety of techniques [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref056" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">56</xref>], the juvenile survival coefficient is 0.039. Thus, hatch-year leatherbacks have greater mortality and variability in hatch-year survival will contribute significantly to overall population variance more so than variability in survival at later life stages.
