<p class="p">Temporal autocorrelation (i.e. persistence) is a feature of many forms of environmental variability and can have major impacts for extinction predictions [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref037" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">37</xref>]. The effect of autocorrelation upon variability is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref>. Here, we have used Model 2, subject to environmental stochasticity with a fixed variance and a variable level of temporal autocorrelation (AR-1 process). The color codes in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> are based on the standard deviation of the logarithm of population. Consistent with the foregoing discussion and with Eq (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pone.0203124.e004" class="xref">4</xref>), population variability increases with increasing autocorrelation (

 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> = 0.5 in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g004" class="xref">Fig 4</xref> corresponds to 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> broadly similar to other values of 
 <italic class="italic">s</italic>
 <sub class="sub">
  <italic class="italic">k</italic>

 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic> = 0 (uncorrelated white-noise forcing), the population dynamics are essentially a random walk, so if 
 <italic class="italic">ρ</italic>&gt;0, especially close to unity, we find the dynamics have more of a black-noise pattern [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref082" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">82</xref>]. Temporal autocorrelation in environmental variability can have various other impacts on population variability, for example through demographic dispersion [
