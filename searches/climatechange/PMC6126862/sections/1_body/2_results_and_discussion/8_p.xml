<p class="p">Various metrics have been used to describe the extent to which organisms exhibit Type III life-history, as described in Appendix B (OSM). At present there is no consensus on which of these is likely to be most useful because the issue arises in different areas of applied ecology but only in fisheries science has the issue received much attention. While Type III organisms are in theory just as much the purview of conservation biology, the paradigm of charismatic organisms (mostly Type I) has been hard to shift. However, the universality and dynamic nature of the threat of climate change will require a rethinking of paradigms.</p>
