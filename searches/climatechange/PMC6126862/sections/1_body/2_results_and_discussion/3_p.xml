 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0203124.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> demonstrate that Type III species have a greater sensitivity to environmental variability than Type I species, greater overall variance and are affected to a greater extent by survival variability. Type III species, with large reproduction and low parental input, are more responsive to environmental fluctuations affecting pre-reproductive stages. When we observe the trajectories of the adult populations in time, we expect the adult population size to show the greatest correlation with survival (and hence the environmental conditions prevailing) in the earliest phase of life. Type I and II species show a more even distribution across life stages.
