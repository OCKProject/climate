This figure illustrates how the population variance arising from environmental variability in the mortality rate is boosted by higher correlation in environmental variability. In general higher variability leads to greater extinction rates. Thus increasing fecundity and increasing redness both lead to an increase in extinction rates. However, once the level of autocorrelation or “redness” becomes high (i.e. when the noise behaves in a more non-stationary fashion, typically for values of
