 <italic class="italic">f</italic> is the fecundity and the subscripts signify the time dependence. Equations of this type are extremely general and can describe a wide variety of systems. They do not require the diffusion approximation [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref036" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">36</xref>], which is needed when using stochastic differential equations [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref071" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">71</xref>], and so can be applied to Type III as well as Type I organisms. When 
 <italic class="italic">R</italic> is stochastic and density dependent, they require technical approaches such as integral equations [

 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref072" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">72</xref>]. Such models have been applied to various taxonomic groups including plants, insects [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref073" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">73</xref>] and amphibians [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref074" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">74</xref>]. We use the simpler density-independent form above because it is commonly used in simulating the probability of low population sizes and requires the fewest number of assumptions about parameters [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref075" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">75</xref>] as well as being much easier to analyze.
