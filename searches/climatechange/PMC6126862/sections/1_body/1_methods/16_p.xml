<p class="p">Simulations of Model 2 used survival rates estimated from natural populations. The precise value of fecundity is chosen so that the overall average growth rate is zero, the same approach as adopted elsewhere [
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.ref077" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">77</xref>]. When environmental stochasticity is present, each parameter is affected equally. Noise, in general autocorrelated, enters the population dynamics through the mortality rate and fecundity, so that each survival term

 </sub> is multiplied by a random factor (See Appendix A in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0203124.s001" class="xref">S1 File</xref>). We used 50 age classes in total. In the case of organisms with an annual clock each class corresponds to a year. In model 2 organisms in their first year are referred to as “recruits” while all other pre-reproductive individuals are “juveniles”.
