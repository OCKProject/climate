<p class="p">We also investigate the responses of different kinds of populations to different conservation actions using Model 2. We define “conservation gain” based on average increases in annual growth rate (
 <italic class="italic">r</italic>) achieved by an action carried out annually. Examples of specific conservation actions might include saving 100 nests (for turtles), decreasing juvenile annual mortality by 0.01 or decreasing 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic>
 <sub class="sub">0</sub> by 1% (see 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Ideally, these would be standardized according to their cost of implementation but economic investigations are beyond the intended scope of this article. We standardize the levels of intervention so as to be equivalent to saving 100 nests for the Wandering Albatross (Type II). Saving 100 nests for the Wandering Albatross has a conservation gain of unity 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic> = 1 when population is 1000. We adjusted the levels of all other interventions so as to yield this same value of 
 <italic class="italic">G</italic> = 1 (with a population of 1000). In other words, the values of 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> in 
 <xref rid="pone.0203124.t001" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 1</xref> were chosen so that, when each of the various actions is carried out for Wandering Albatross, the effect on 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> (in the absence of environmental stochasticity) is the same as the decrease in nest mortality achieved by saving 100 Wandering Albatross nests when the total population size is 1000. The model is set up so that the age-structure is stable and the growth rate zero before applying the conservation action. With intervention levels thus fixed, we ran 1000 simulations for each species at each intervention type for the same set of environmental stochasticity. Environmental stochasticity was fixed with 
 <italic class="italic">σ</italic> = 0.1 with no autocorrelation. We then looked at what happened when the same actions were applied to other organisms with different strategies. We ran each model for 250 years and found the average 
 <italic class="italic">r</italic> using linear regression for the last 150 years of each run. For the same conditions of environmental stochasticity, conservation gain was the difference in yearly growth rate (as a percentage) between the populations boosted by a conservation mechanism and those without a boost.
