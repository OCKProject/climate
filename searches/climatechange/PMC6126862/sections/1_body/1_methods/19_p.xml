<p class="p">This model analysis is highly simplified. For example, our models do not consider evolutionary changes, spatial structure or density dependence. We also do not study a number of life-history traits such as semelparity, demographic dispersion, generation time or longevity. While all these and others may influence population dynamics, exploring these factors is beyond the intended scope of our analysis.</p>
