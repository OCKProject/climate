<p class="p">Model 1 could be thought of as a model for organisms that have either a single age-class with reproduction at the end of the cycle or one with many age classes all with the same survival. Model 2 is more realistic than Model 1, as it can accommodate overlapping generations and contains age-structured survival, but it still involves some simplifying assumptions. As well as ignoring density dependence we assume all age classes experience the same proportional perturbation in a given year, as implied by Eq (
