<p class="p">Reaction-diffusion equations (RDE) were used with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the expected changes in the properties of patch patterns that evolve along a rainfall transition between semi-arid and arid rainfall regions following a predicted decline in water resources in the Mediterranean Basin. The characteristic equilibrium patterns that emerge as a result of the three rainfall regimes are: spotty vegetation patterns at rainfall levels lower than 0.8 mm/day, transition between spotty vegetation and spotty soil patterns through striped and labyrinth-like patterns for rainfall levels between 0.8 and 1 mm/day, and high vegetation cover together with spotty and striped soil patterns at rainfall levels higher than 1 mm/day. Pattern characteristics of eccentricity and solidity responded inversely to the decline in rainfall, and the ratio between the two parameters is suggested to be an efficient morphometric indicator. The eccentricity ratio versus rainfall line (ER:R line), together with a line that distinguishes between soil dominance and vegetation dominance at the 1 mm/day rainfall level allows to differentiate between four typologies of developed and degraded patterns. For the range between 1.2 and 0.8 mm/day rainfall, the continuous rainfall decline yielded patterns with higher vegetation connectivity than patterns that evolved at corresponding discrete rainfall levels, as inferred by ERs above the ER:R line. We hypothesize that this result represents "pattern inheritance" of plant-soil relationships that evolved prior to the decline in rainfall levels. Thus, for this range, space-for-time substitution represents an overestimation of the consequences of the expected rainfall decline (e.g., [

For rainfall levels lower than 0.8 mm/day, the eccentricity ratios from the discrete and continuous experiments converge practically to the same trend of pattern change along the ER:R line. Thus, the rainfall gradient hypothesis may be valid for regions within this important rainfall range, which typically includes desert fringe ecosystems.
