<p class="p">This research follows the line of assessing primarily equilibrium patterns based on simulations that represent changes in water availability. Human disturbances significantly increase the complexity of relationships between patterns and habitat conditions. As Tietjen and Jeltsch ([
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]) suggest, these effects require looking into as well. Several recent studies that included simulations of recovery following disturbance (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref040" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>]) found that there is an inheritance aspect also to patterns that are recovering from disturbance. Yet it is well understood that human disturbances add almost infinitesimal forms of pattern variation and real difficulties in distinguishing climate-induced changes from human-induced changes. With the growing availability of remote sensing data at high spatiotemporal resolutions, it is possible to broaden these assessments into real pattern sequences in which environmental information may help minimize uncertainty regarding the causes of pattern change. These avenues of research will be addressed in future phases of our research in this field.
