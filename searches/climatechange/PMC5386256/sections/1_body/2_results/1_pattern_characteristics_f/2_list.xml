   <underline class="underline">Rainfall under 0.8 mm/day:</underline> Patterns in this rainfall range are primarily spotted, with small and medium size vegetation patches scattered over the bare ground. Solidity is maintained high, while eccentricity decreases with the decreasing rainfall.

   <underline class="underline">Rainfall over 1 mm/day</underline>: This range is characterized by dominant vegetation cover and pattern properties that are best represented by the characteristics of the soil patch distribution. Higher levels of rainfall are incorporated by a lower proportion of bare soil with a highly connected vegetation network at 1 mm/day rainfall and a spotty pattern at 1.2 mm/day rainfall. Differences in eccentricity and solidity represent well the differences between these patterns, whereby the stripped pattern is characterized by high eccentricity and low solidity, and the spotty pattern by high solidity and slightly lower eccentricity.

   <underline class="underline">Intermediate rainfall levels between 1 and 0.8 mm/day:</underline> This rainfall range is characterized by highly connected soil and vegetation networks. At the 0.8 mm/day rainfall level, vegetation stripes are more often truncated, with higher solidity and lower eccentricity levels, while at the 1 mm/day level, the pattern of vegetation stripes has lower solidity and higher eccentricity.
