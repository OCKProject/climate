<p class="p">In general, eccentricity and solidity vary inversely in response to changing rainfall levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174942.g003" class="xref">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Thus, the combined eccentricity ratio (ER) index decreases linearly with the decrease in rainfall, for rainfall levels equal or lower than 1 mm/day (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0174942.g003" class="xref">Fig 3C</xref>). The high slope of the ER vs R line indicates the high sensitivity of the new metric to rainfall change.
