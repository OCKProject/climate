<p class="p">The fragmented soil pattern obtained at 1 mm/day in the moderate continuous rainfall decrease scenario was transformed into a labyrinth-like pattern at a rainfall level of 0.9 and was maintained also at 0.8 mm/day. Further decrease in rainfall resulted in the progressive dissection of the long vegetation patches into short stripes at 0.7 mm/day and into a spotty pattern at 0.6 mm/day. The ERs of patterns that emerged in this experiment lie within Region II at levels significantly higher than the ER:R line, expressing the highly connected network of vegetation patches maintained almost throughout the entire range of rainfall decrease. ER levels in this experiment were the highest (~1.8), reaching well above the maximum level obtained in Experiments 1 and 2 for vegetation (1.2). The rate of decrease in ER is also very high at decreasing rainfall levels below 0.8 mm/day.</p>
