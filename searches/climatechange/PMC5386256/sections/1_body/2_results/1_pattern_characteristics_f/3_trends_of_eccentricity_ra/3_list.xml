  <p class="p">Region I is the region below the ER line and to the left of the 1 mm/day rainfall line. This region represents recovering patterns prior to equilibrium or degraded patterns due to human disturbance or a decrease in habitat resources.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Region II lies above the ER line and to the left of the 1 mm/day rainfall line. This region represents "developed" vegetation patterns of larger patches and/or higher connectivity than patterns characteristic of corresponding rainfall levels along the ER:R line.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Region III is the region below the ER line and to the right of the 1 mm/day rainfall line, and it represents favorable vegetation conditions due to vegetation dominance and high fragmentation of soil patches.</p>
 </list-item>
 <list-item class="list-item">
  <p class="p">Region IV lies above the ER line and to the right of the 1 mm/day rainfall line. This region is characterized by higher connectivity of soil patches than in patterns that characterize Region III at corresponding rainfall levels.</p>
