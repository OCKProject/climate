<p class="p">Patterns at 0.8 mm/day rainfall differed significantly between the experiments: the pattern obtained in the discrete experiment was patchy, while those obtained in the two continuous experiments were labyrinth-like. With a 0.1 mm/day decrease in rainfall, however, the pattern becomes spotty in all three experiments and the trends of change converge. The information from the discrete patterns for the range between 0.8 and 0.6 mm/day may serve as close approximation for pattern properties characteristic of continuous rainfall decrease. The space-for-time approximations along rainfall gradients seem, therefore, to be valid for this range, which represents rainfall levels at the desert fringe.</p>
