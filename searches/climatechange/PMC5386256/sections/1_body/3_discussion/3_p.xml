<p class="p">These results suggest that vegetation patches facing a decrease in rainfall sustain the change in water availability due to their improved plant-soil conditions (e.g., organic matter content and deep root systems), which evolved prior to the decrease in water levels. In other words, there is a kind of "inheritance" of previous growth conditions that moderates the response of vegetation to changes in rainfall: this is the “ecosystem resistance against catastrophic shifts” suggested by Rietkerk et al.
