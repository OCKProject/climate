<p class="p">Experiment 1 represented the discrete rainfall gradient scenario (DGS) in which RDE simulations were carried out separately for seven discrete rainfall levels (between 1.2 and 0.6 mm/day). Initial spatial plant distribution for each run consisted of random plant distribution in 1% of grid elements, which were set in the plantless equilibrium of soil and surface water. Simulations were stopped when the change in all observed parameters was smaller than the prescribed threshold, i.e. the pattern evolution had reached equilibrium. The continuous mode of rainfall change was assessed by applying rainfall decrease on the equilibrium patterns reached at the discrete rainfall levels. The decrease in rainfall simulated here follows the rainfall change trends reported by Philandras et al. ([
