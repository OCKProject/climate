<p class="p">The second and third experiments simulated two types of continuous rainfall change. In 
 <underline class="underline">Experiment 2</underline>, a moderate continuous rainfall reduction scenario was applied on equilibrium patterns that represent Mediterranean semi-arid (1.2 mm/day), hot semi-arid (1 mm/day), and desert fringe (0.8 mm/day) ecoregions. Plant distribution and soil and surface water of patterns that reached equilibrium at these rainfall levels in Experiment 1 were subjected to iterative changes in rainfall. In each iteration, the annual rainfall level was decreased by 36.5 mm (0.1 mm/day). Simulations at this level continued until the pattern reached equilibrium and only then did we progress to the next iteration with a lower rainfall level. Earlier assessments of such simulations indicated that equilibrium is reached after 5 to 8 simulated years. Dividing the reduction of 36.5 mm by the number of simulated years, yields an annual change of 4.5 to 7.3 mm. These rates are comparable to the 2â€“6 mm per year rates reported by Philandras et al.
