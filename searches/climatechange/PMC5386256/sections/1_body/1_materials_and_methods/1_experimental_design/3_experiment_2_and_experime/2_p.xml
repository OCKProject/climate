 <underline class="underline">Experiment 3</underline> simulated the desertification of Mediterranean ecoregions by gradually decreasing rainfall from Mediterranean semi-arid levels (1.2 mm/day) to desert levels (0.6 mm/day). Initial conditions (plant distribution, soil and surface water) for this scenario were represented by the pattern that reached equilibrium at the 1.2 mm/day rainfall level in Experiment 1. Similar to Experiment 2, rainfall was decreased in each iteration by 0.1 mm/day and the RDE simulation continued until the process reached equilibrium for this rainfall level, before progressing to the next rainfall reduction level (next iteration). The iterations were stopped when rainfall reached 0.6 mm/day.
