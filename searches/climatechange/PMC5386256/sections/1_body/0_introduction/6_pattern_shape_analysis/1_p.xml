<p class="p">Substantial work has been done in the study of landscape ecology concerning the use of landscape metrics for studying affinities between forms of spatial processes, their ecological mechanisms, and their driving forces [

 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref051" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">51</xref>]; however, research on the use of such metrics in the study of climate change is limited. We suggest characterizing the spatial forms of the vegetation or bare soil patches with solidity and eccentricity parameters, where solidity (S) is the ratio between the area of an object and its convex area, and eccentricity (E) is the ratio between the major and minor axes of the best fitting ellipse (detailed information is given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0174942.s002" class="xref">S2 Appendix</xref>). During the transformation of spotty patterns into banded patterns and then into convoluted labyrinths, patches lose their solidity and become more elongated and connected. Our hypothesis is that the use of eccentricity and solidity metrics may improve morphometric sensitivity to pattern changes associated with changes in water availability. Following the assessment of these metrics and their inverse mode of change, we suggest a new metric that represents the ratio between these two original metrics which facilitates improved sensitivity to pattern changes.
