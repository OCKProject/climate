<p class="p">Studying the potential consequences of such a decrease poses a fundamental challenge due to the high ecological, hydrological, and geomorphological diversity of Mediterranean regions [

 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>]. Despite the limitations of these approaches (e.g., [

 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]), all three were used to improve our understanding of future impacts of climate change in a distinctive number of studies (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]). Miranda et al. ([
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref004" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">4</xref>]), who based their research on earlier studies, suggested that for decreasing rainfall levels of between 30%, and 80% in semi-arid shrub steppe, aboveground productivity is linearly correlated to annual precipitation. Such findings support the extensive use of precipitation gradients for predicting responses of ecosystems to climate changes (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref010" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>]). On the other hand, a more recent study [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref005" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">5</xref>] claimed that “inferences based on space-for-time substitution overestimate the magnitude of responses to contemporary climate warming, because spatial gradients reflect long-term processes”. Further assessment of rainfall gradients as space-for-time transformations that facilitate the prediction of ecosystem responses to climate change is therefore undoubtedly required. Within such an assessment, changes in patch pattern properties along these processes should be examined; as such changes may serve as early indicators of climate change [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref011" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">12</xref>]. Historical information sources such as aerial photographs and manipulation experiments are of limited spatial extent and temporal range, and their value for such assessments is, therefore, limited as well.
