 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]), and reaction-diffusion simulations in particular, may facilitate the analysis of patch pattern responses to changes in water availability (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]). This approach was implemented by researchers studying the formation and change of patterns along rainfall gradients under desertification (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">15</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>]); however, relatively few studies have examined the change in pattern characteristics due to decreasing or increasing water availability. Indicators mentioned within this context include, for example, truncation of power-law relationships (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>]), changes in the spatial frequencies of stripes (e.g. [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref025" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">25</xref>]), and migration of stripes [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref019" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref027" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">27</xref>]. Variations in water availability (rainfall) involve shifts between spotty and striped patterns through myriad forms of different spatial complexity (e.g., [
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref017" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">28</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref033" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">33</xref>]). While spotty patterns are characterized by high solidity (similarity of a patch to its convex hull) and low elongation, striped patterns are typically of low solidity and high elongation. We thus hypothesize that metrics of eccentricity and solidity are sensitive to pattern changes associated with decreasing rainfall. The sensitivity of these pattern properties to rainfall changes are expected to be instrumental in identifying areas affected by decrease in water resources, and in assessing the extent to which current rainfall pattern relationships represent future pattern responses to rainfall decline.
