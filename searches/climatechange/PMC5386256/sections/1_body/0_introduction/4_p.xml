<p class="p">With the exception of studies that examined the spatial properties of gaps between vegetation patches, most of the existing work that used landscape metrics represents the form of vegetation patches while disregarding the bare soil pattern configuration. Shoshany ([

 <xref rid="pone.0174942.ref035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">35</xref>]) stressed the importance of mutually analyzing the pattern properties of both vegetation and soil patch configurations so as to gain a better understanding of habitat transformations. Here, by implementing reaction-diffusion equations (RDEs), we will examine the eccentricity and solidity of shrub and soil patch patterns, in response to decreasing rainfall levels, as potential indicators of rainfall decline. These simulations will also serve in the assessment of the rainfall gradient hypothesis of space-for-time transformations, by comparing discrete and continuous modes of pattern responses to rainfall change. The discrete mode will be realized by simulating pattern evolution at discrete rainfall levels; responses to climate change will be informed only implicitly, through differences in the pattern properties. The continuous mode of change will be realized by the change in the patterns that emerged in the discrete mode following a simulated decrease in rainfall, thus representing rainfall change in an explicit manner. To the best of our knowledge, RDEs had not been utilized yet in assessing the space-for-time hypothesis.
