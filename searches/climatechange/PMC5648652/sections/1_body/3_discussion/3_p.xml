<p class="p">The effect of the level of genetic diversity in threshold values was dependent on the actual 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐values. When the threshold value in combination with the local survival conditions gave the most fit phenotype across most of the landscape (
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.5), this would increase the expansion speed compared to higher levels of genetic diversity (0 ≤ 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>≤
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>1, Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). This was not the case when the threshold value was fitted to either migratory (
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.9) or residential populations (
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.1), in which scenarios the colonization depended on a de novo mutation of 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> and therefore took longer. Generally, the colonization of either empty habitat patches or patches inhabited by individuals of the wrong phenotype would be limited by the species’ dispersal capacity. Importantly, while populations were maladapted after the abrupt and extreme environmental changes, there was only one scenario 
 <italic class="italic">(“compl‐zero”)</italic> in which this actually led to a temporary local population extinction (Fig.
