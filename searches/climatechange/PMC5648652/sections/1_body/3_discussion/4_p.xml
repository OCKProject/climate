<p class="p">Rapid changes of migratory behavior in response to changing conditions are well documented. Many examples exist of changes in arrival and migration time, changes in migration routes and wintering areas, and also population shifts either toward more migratory or more sedentary and even residential behavior (Able &amp; Belthoff,

 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). This flexibility is often attributed to plasticity as opposed to evolutionary change in migratory behavior (Knudsen et al., 
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). However, the finding that the inheritance of migratory activity is best described by the threshold model of quantitative genetics (Pulido, 
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>) reconciles these viewpoints regarding the issue of migratory versus residential behavior for species where migration is controlled endogenously. In this study, we investigate the evolutionary change in local threshold values that determine migratory behavior in combination with local survival conditions, which is thus a plastic trait. In migratory fish, this was studied by Sahashi and Morita (
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>), who show that selection on the threshold value (in their case a threshold in size at maturity), resulted in a decreasing threshold value with increasing distance from the sea, leading to an increased number of residential individuals as migration costs increase. Also here, migratory behavior is plastic, as a fish of a certain size at maturity is migratory under downstream conditions, and residential in upstream populations, which is comparable to our trait, where a specific
