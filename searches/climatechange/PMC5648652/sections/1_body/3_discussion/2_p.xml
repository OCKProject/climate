Here, we extend their study by relaxing their initialization conditions and investigating a range of climate change‐related scenarios to study the robustness of their findings. Our results show that assuming the genetic threshold model for migratory behavior allows rapid across generation changes in migration decisions at the landscape level and a spatially and temporally stable zone of partially migratory populations under all investigated scenarios. This suggests that if climate change‐induced shifts in species’ ranges as well as changes in survival probabilities and reproductive success are observed to be met with flexibility in migratory behavior at the species level, this indicates support for a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior and lowers the impact of these changes on population sizes. The mentioned flexibility should be interpreted as changes across generations in the decision whether or not to migrate in populations at specific locations in the landscape.
