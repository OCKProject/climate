<p class="p">Our model is artificial in a number of ways: We assume discrete generations and haploid inheritance. The results thus mainly provide a view of the selection landscape, in interaction with the limited mutation and dispersal rates. The result that shifts in the selection pressure lead to quick responses while maintaining stable mixed populations were obtained under a wide range of scenarios and parameter values. Another simplification of reality was made when assuming that individuals can perfectly predict what their local survival probability is, that is, they “know perfectly” where they are. This aspect has been thoroughly tested by Cobben and Van Noordwijk (
