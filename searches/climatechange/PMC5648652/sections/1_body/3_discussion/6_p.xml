<p class="p">We have used the trait of being migratory in a set of life history traits inspired by passerine ecology. We believe that the results are equally valid for other threshold characters in other life histories. The classical examples of threshold characters are insect traits, such as multivoltinism, diapause, and wing dimorphism (Matsumura,

 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1996</xref>; Söderlind &amp; Nylin, 
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). Some of these traits, for example, diapause, also fulfill the condition that local densities for one phenotype are lower due to the existence and inherent absence of the other phenotype. Although density dependence is not essential for the maintenance of populations consisting of both phenotypes, it does substantially increase the area where mixed populations are observed (Cobben &amp; Van Noordwijk, 
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). A major difference with the life history studied here is that in insects the reproduction is much higher. From this, one can expect an increase in the number of mutations which will likely cause an even wider zone of mixed populations. The modest maximum dispersal distance employed in this study is fairly agreeable to insect life history, in all implying that our model is also applicable to insect life histories and well‐known threshold traits in these.
