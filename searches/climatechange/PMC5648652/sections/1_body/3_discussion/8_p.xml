<p class="p">In this study, we investigated the flexibility of migratory behavior at the landscape and species level, and stability of partially migratory populations under a set of different initialization conditions and climate change‚Äêrelated scenarios. The results indicate that assuming a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior always leads to a spatial zone consisting of partially migratory populations and supports rapid changes of local observed migratory phenotypes, which is in agreement with empirical data.</p>
