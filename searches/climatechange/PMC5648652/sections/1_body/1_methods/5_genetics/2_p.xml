<p class="p">The individuals have one genetic trait, the migration threshold, which is located at a single gene. The threshold value 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic> is a continuous number in the range [0,1]. The individuals are haploid and reproduce asexually, thus the offspring inherit the threshold values from their mothers. To allow for some variation, we apply a probability of mutation 
 <italic class="italic">m</italic>. When such a mutation occurs, the threshold value is changed into a new randomly chosen value [0,1].
