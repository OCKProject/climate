<p class="p">The simulated landscape consists of 100 columns (
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐dimension) of 25 breeding patches each (
 <italic class="italic">y</italic>‐dimension), all with carrying capacity 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. We assume bouncing borders in both 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">y</italic> directions. Hence, an individual cannot leave the landscape by dispersal, but migratory individuals are assumed to not spend their winters in the landscape that signifies only the species’ breeding area. There are two gradients in the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐dimension, of increasing winter survival and decreasing reproduction, simulating average conditions on a trajectory from the pole to the equator. The experienced nominal average winter survival for residents is 0.01 times the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐location, so changes linearly from 0.01 at 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>1 to 1 at 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>100 (Equation 
 <xref rid="ece33357-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(1)</xref>). Reproduction is corrected for position along the 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐dimension through a reproduction factor that decreases linearly from 1 at 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>1 to 0.8 at 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>100 (Equation 
 <xref rid="ece33357-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula" class="xref">(2)</xref>), incorporating the process that these species prefer more polar breeding areas where a high‐quality food peak can sustain larger broods. Both winter survival and reproduction are reduced by density‐dependent factors (see below for further details).
