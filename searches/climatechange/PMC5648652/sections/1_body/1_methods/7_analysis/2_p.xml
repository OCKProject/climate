<p class="p">The individual phenotypes, that is, migrancy versus residency, were documented in time and space throughout the simulations and summed per 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐location. The migration threshold values were averaged per 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐location. We defined the polar border of the partial migration zone as the smallest 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐location where the total number of residents was at least 1% of the total number of individuals. The equatorial border is equivalently defined as the largest 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐location where at least 1% of the total number of individuals was a migrant. The difference between both borders is the width of the partial migration zone, while the location of the zone was defined by its middle 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐ location.
