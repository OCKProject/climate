 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>), a parsimonious model was used to investigate whether the inclusion of such a genetic threshold model for migratory behavior can explain the existence of partially migratory populations. They conclude that assuming a threshold model leads to a spatially and temporally stable zone of partially migratory populations under a wide range of demographic parameter values. While the specific location and width of this zone of partial migration vary with dispersal distances and the strength of density dependence, structural differences between phenotypes and density dependence are no prerequisites for obtaining such a zone. Cobben and Van Noordwijk (
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) investigate the equilibrium selection pressures on the threshold value across the species’ range under model initializations with the number of individuals and the level of genetic diversity at carrying capacity.
