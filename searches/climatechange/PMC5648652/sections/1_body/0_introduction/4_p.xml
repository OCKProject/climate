<p class="p">Global warming has profound effects on geographical species distributions, showing range shifts for many taxa as a result of changing environmental conditions (Chen, Hill, Ohlemueller, Roy, &amp; Thomas,

 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). Particularly, for migratory species, it is expected that arrival at the breeding grounds might be increasingly mistimed under global warming as a result of the uncoupling of long‐used cues and actual environmental conditions, with decreasing reproduction as a consequence (Both &amp; Visser,

In this study, we investigate the consequences for migratory behavior and the stability of the zone of partial migration under the assumption of a threshold model for migratory behavior, under a wide range of climate change‐related scenarios. For this, we use the model of Cobben and Van Noordwijk (
 <xref rid="ece33357-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>) with the purpose to provide testable hypotheses for empirically investigating the support for this threshold model in the field. In addition, we relax their initialization assumptions regarding the level of genetic diversity to investigate the consequences of a reduced availability of genetic variation for the model outcomes. Specifically, we look into these five scenarios: (i) initialization with zero genetic diversity, both with a universally beneficial threshold value and a locally beneficial threshold value; (ii) initialization of the species at only the extreme ends of the landscape, so with migrant populations or resident populations only, to investigate the speed of range expansion after initialization; (iii) improving winter survival probability from the viewpoint that an increased winter temperature will relax stressful environmental conditions; (iv) deteriorating winter survival probability from the viewpoint that species interactions can mismatch and predictability of the conditions is lowered; (v) deteriorating reproductive success for migratory individuals from the viewpoint that these will suffer most from unpredictability of the environment, resulting in mistimed arrival at the breeding grounds. We are interested in the relationship between the level of genetic diversity and flexibility of migratory behavior at the species level, and specifically explore the speed of changes in the frequency of migratory phenotypes across generations following changes in environmental conditions, and the speed of colonization across the partial migration zone under initializations with different levels of genetic variation.
