<p class="p">In the range expansion scenarios, the genetic diversity and location at initialization determine the species’ colonization speed across the zone of partial migration and therefore across the entire landscape (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). Expansion from an initialization with 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.5 is fastest, followed by expansion after initialization with maximum genetic diversity, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic> =  [0,1]. Average expansion speed is lowest after initialization with fitted 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>, which is 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.1 for initialization with residents, and 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.9 for migrants. 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.5 results in a phenotype switch (the result of which can be seen in Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) at 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>50, which allows fast colonization of the zone of partial migration. After colonization, selection on the threshold value increases the number of migrants and thus moves the zone of partially migratory populations toward a larger 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐value, as increasing population densities benefit the migratory phenotype due to reduced average resident survival (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33357-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). Initialization with full genetic diversity of 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic> =  [0,1] results in an on average slower range expansion because colonization of the partial migration zone is limited by dispersal of individuals with a proper 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐value (i.e., coding for the beneficial phenotype at that location). When the populations are initialized with a fitted 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐value (
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.1 for residents and 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.9 for migrants), the colonization of the partial migration zone depends on the de novo mutation of a proper 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐value, which causes an on average lower colonization rate of the landscape. At 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>&gt;
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>50, the survival probability is higher for residents than for migrants that always have a survival probability of 0.5. This results in a greater expansion speed across the landscape up to the partial migration zone in the scenarios initialized with resident populations, in contrast to initialization with migrants only, independent of the level and value of genetic variation.
