<p class="p">Abruptly changing environmental conditions after model initialization cause a change in the location of the zone of partially migratory populations (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>) and in the total numbers of individuals, but never a qualitative change in phenotype distributions (i.e., the specific, or quantitative outcome could be different, but the general pattern is always the same) or the complete extinction of the passerine. The applied increase in resident winter survival of 20% causes a shift of the zone of partially migratory populations toward lower 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐locations as the residential phenotype has an increased benefit. As the resident winter survival is decreased by 20%, we observe the opposite effect with a shift of the PM zone toward higher 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐locations by an increase in the number of migrants as the migratory phenotype has increased benefit. A decrease in migrant reproductive success of 20% again causes a shift of the partial migration zone toward lower 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐locations with a larger number of fully residential populations due to increased fitness of this phenotype. Changing winter survival conditions in the scenario with individuals initialized in all populations with zero genetic diversity of 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.5 (“
 <italic class="italic">compl‐zero”</italic>) was applied immediately after initialization to prevent genetic diversity from increasing during the model run and investigate the extreme circumstance of abrupt change without genetic diversity. Under winter survival increase (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>a), the new equilibrium location of the zone of partial migration more or less equals the location after initialization, resulting in a stable location after environmental change. When winter survival decreases (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece33357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>b), the location of the PM zone in the “
 <italic class="italic">compl‐zero”</italic> scenario needs to move furthest of all scenarios. This happens during a longer time period and with a larger standard deviation but eventually leads to the same result, without the occurrence of species’ extinction in any of the replicate runs. In this extreme scenario, we do see local population extinction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33357-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>) as the combination of reproduction level and changed resident winter survival prevents the existence of stable resident populations near the zone of partial migration. These habitats of locally extinct populations of residents then need to become colonized by migratory individuals first. As the occurring 
 <italic class="italic">T </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>0.5 codes for the migratory phenotype up to 
 <italic class="italic">x </italic>=
 <italic class="italic"> </italic>70 under the changed survival curve of the resident winter survival, the shift of the zone of partial migration is initially not limited by the de novo mutation of beneficial 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐values. However, as the population sizes increase again, the positive feedback loop between threshold values and number of individuals also occurs here, after which the individuals with higher 
 <italic class="italic">T</italic>‐values (and thus migratory phenotype) can later replace residents at 
 <italic class="italic">x</italic>‐values larger than 70 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ece33357-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>).
