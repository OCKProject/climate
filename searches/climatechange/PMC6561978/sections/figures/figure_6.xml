  <p class="p">Relationship of the mean percentage overlap (MPO, percentage of spatial overlap between snake species distribution and protected areas network in Atlantic Forest Hotspot) and the number of cells occupied by the species at present and future (2080). Species are numbered and represented by black dots. The dashed lines show mean percentage overlap from 1,000 randomisations, grey surface represents the random range, which indicates the range of the 95th percentiles of the randomised data; (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) indicate MPO relationship for viviparous snake species at present and future times respectively; (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>,
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) indicate MPO values of oviparous snake species for present and future respectively.
