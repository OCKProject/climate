 </sup> which have been currently evaluated as endangered and vulnerable, respectively, on the national threatened species list, were projected to both be endangered at the end of this century as a result of the climate change. It should be noted that viviparous species confer an evolutionary advantage by allowing females to keep embryo temperature constant, which it would be a benefit mainly in climatically unstable regions
