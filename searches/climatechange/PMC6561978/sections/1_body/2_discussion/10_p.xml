<p id="Par24" class="p">Different ENM methods yield different predictions which are consistent with results from different comparative studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">89</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90" class="xref">90</xref>
 </sup>, our consensus model showed more consistent results for both reproductive groups, reflecting the main direction of variation among species richness maps. However, when multiple species are considered, the choice of how the individual species will be treated generally should have more impact on outcomes than decisions regarding the choice of the analytical algorithms
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>
 </sup>. In our study, the range of each individual species was previously modelled and then overlapped to obtain richness maps. This approach enables each species to respond in an individualistic manner to the environmental gradient
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>
 </sup>, instead of other methods that assume the unrealistic condition that the functional form of these responses is the same across all species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">91</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, the approach used in this study generates more detailed richness and turnover maps discretely bound by the limits of each individual species. However, it is important to mention that ENM predictions are subject to uncertainties inherent to the modelling process per se

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92" class="xref">92</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93" class="xref">93</xref>
 </sup>. For instance, uncertainties from spatial coverage of samplings, characteristics of training data, decision thresholds, variables selection, reliability of absence data and presence-only models challenge the production of accurate species distribution outputs

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">94</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96" class="xref">96</xref>
 </sup>. In our study, we used presence-only models to predict the impacts of the climate change on the snakes of the Atlantic Forest Hotspot. Although presence-only models can embed some variability in the predictions, they have been the only alternative when absence data are unavailable or impossible to obtain

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97" class="xref">97</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99" class="xref">99</xref>
