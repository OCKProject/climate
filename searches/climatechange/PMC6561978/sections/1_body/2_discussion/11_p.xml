<p id="Par25" class="p">Though the difference in responses of species belonging to two reproductive groups is expected to be tenuous due to phylogenetic similarity, we concluded that the greater temporal dissimilarity of species composition and the more drastic range contractions of oviparous species are indicative of a greater frailty of these species in the face of climate change in terms of habitat requirements. Considering the physiological and behavioural particularities of both reproductive modes reported by the literature, it is possible that, in addition to the milder losses in the distribution area found here, viviparous snakes may also adapt more successfully to the projected climate shifts due to their ability to regulate their body temperature, and also their offspring by moving

 </sup>, even over short distances, which could alleviate the distribution losses. Finally, it is worrying from a conservation perspective that the existing PAs of the Atlantic Forest Hotspot are poorly conserving snake species at current time and that they should also fail in protecting the snake diversity in the future. The situation is aggravated by the fact that the PAs are not currently connected to each other to allow the dispersal of the species. Thus, an important step towards a more effective strategy for conservation of biodiversity in Atlantic Forest would be the expansion of the PAs network preferably in connected configurations and that taking into account the effects of future climate change on the species. We call for the need for studies focused on the planning of new PAs, identifying areas that maximize the species occupancy under future warming scenarios, accounting not only for snake richness, but also additional groups of species with greatest conservation need.
