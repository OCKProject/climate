 </sup>, we used the ecological niche models (ENMs) to predict the distribution area of snake species in the Atlantic Forest Hotspot. For this analysis, we used the species occurrence matrix and the layers of climatic-environmental variables for building ecological niche models and obtaining a suitability matrix, from which the potential distribution of each species was mapped.
