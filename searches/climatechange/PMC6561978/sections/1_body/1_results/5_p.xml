<p id="Par12" class="p">Our results indicated that under the high loss of habitat suitability, 73.6% and 67.6% of oviparous and viviparous species, respectively, should lose at least 50% of its original range by 2080 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Only 7.3% of oviparous species and 14.7% of viviparous species should lose less than 30% from the original distribution area of the species, given the restrictions imposed by future climate conditions. According to IUCN criterion B1, 15.45% of oviparous species and 11.76% of viviparous species are projected to be threatened by 2080 (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Our results also indicated that the oviparous species 
 <italic class="italic">Phalotris lemniscatus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Clelia hussami</italic> are expected to be extinct from the biome by 2080. Conversely, two oviparous species were projected to benefit with climate change; 
 <italic class="italic">Xenodon merremii</italic> should increase 37% of its range and 
 <italic class="italic">Drymarchon corais</italic> should increase 14% of its range. The oviparous species 
 <italic class="italic">Chironius carinatus</italic> was the only species practically unaffected (habitat losses of only 0.2%). The summary of the impacts of future climatic changes on each individual species is given in Supplementary Table
