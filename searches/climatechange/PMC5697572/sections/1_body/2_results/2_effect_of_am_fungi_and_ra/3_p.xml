<p class="p">For both rainfall scenarios, the effect of AM fungi on nutrient losses was tracked after every simulated rainfall across the experimental period (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). The presence of AM fungi consistently decreased mineral P losses for both rain treatments (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). However, the impact of AM fungi on N loss varied throughout the experiment: in the first growth period mycorrhizal fungi decreased N loss, whereas the effect was inversed during the second growth period, where the presence of AM fungi stimulates total mineral N loss (Fig.

 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>). The later was probably due to N‐release from N‐fixing legumes, which were much more abundant in the treatment with AM fungi (see the next section).
