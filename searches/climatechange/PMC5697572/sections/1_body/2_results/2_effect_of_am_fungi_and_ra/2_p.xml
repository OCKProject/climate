<p class="p">Rainfall intensity had a strong positive effect on the amount of nutrients lost from soil through leaching (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Mycorrhizal fungi also influenced the total amount of nutrients lost by decreasing both total mineral P and N loss through leaching (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>; F Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a,b). The reduction of P loss from plant communities with AM fungi was approximately the same for both rainfall intensities, around 50%, which corresponds to 0.0133 kg P/ha (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>a). In contrast, the effect of AM fungi on N loss from the plant community through leaching depended on rainfall treatment, (i.e., the interaction between AM and rain treatments was significant [Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>]). Under high‐intensity rain, AM fungi reduced mineral N loss by almost 40% (corresponding to 1.44 kg N/ha) compared to microcosms without AM fungi, whereas at moderate‐intensity rainfall, there was no significant difference in mineral N loss between treatments with and without AM fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>b). The total volume of leachate differed between AM treatments (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0001" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">1</xref>), the volume leached being around 16% lower in presence of AM fungi (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>c).
