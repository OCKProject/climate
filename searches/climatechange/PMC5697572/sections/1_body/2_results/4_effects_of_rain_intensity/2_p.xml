<p class="p">Non‐AM treatments remained free of AM fungal colonization, while colonization of roots in microcosms with AM fungi was successful. Percentage of root length colonized by AM hyphae, vesicles, and arbuscules at the end of the first growing period was not affected by the rain regime (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0002" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">2</xref>), while in the second harvest vesicles, arbuscules, and total AM fungal colonization were higher in the moderate than in the high‐intensity rain treatment (Table
