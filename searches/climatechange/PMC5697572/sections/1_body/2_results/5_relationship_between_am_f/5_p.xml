<p class="p">The results in Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref> include data from all microcosms including mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal treatments. In a next step, we removed the data from nonmycorrhizal microcosms and tested whether differences in root colonization could explain differences in nutrient loss across the mycorrhizal microcosms. No significant correlations were observed (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). These results indicate that especially differences between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal microcosms are important in explaining nutrient losses. However, the variation of the level of colonization was small between the replicates of the inoculated communities (it varied from 74% to 94% and from 62% to 80% within the moderate and high rain treatment, respectively), compared with the variation of AM fungal root colonization among natural grasslands. A more appropriate way to specifically test the effect of differences in fungal colonization would have been to test a gradient of mycorrhizal abundance created as independent variable (e.g., by using different inoculum densities).
