<p class="p">Phosphorus losses decreased with higher AM fungal colonization in both rain regimes. Specifically, total hyphal colonization and vesicles (i.e., assumed to be a nutrient reservoir organelle) negatively correlated with P losses for both rain treatments, while arbuscules percentage (i.e., assumed to be a nutrient transfer organelle) only correlated to P losses within the moderate‐intensity rain treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Similarly, N losses decreased with higher AM fungal colonization (hyphae, vesicles, and arbuscules) within the high treatment but not within the moderate‐intensity rain treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>).
