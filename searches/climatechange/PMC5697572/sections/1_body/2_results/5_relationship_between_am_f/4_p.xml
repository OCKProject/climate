<p class="p">Induced changes in plant community composition through altered biomass of the different plant species in response to the presence of AM fungi were correlated to the amount of nutrients lost via leaching. Likewise, the biomass of forbs and legumes (plant functional groups enhanced by AM fungal presence) was negatively correlated with nutrient losses (N and P) under high rain regime. In contrast, the biomass of grasses was positively correlated to nutrient losses, enhancing P loss in the moderate rain treatment and N loss in the high‐intensity rain treatment (Table
