<p class="p">Correlations between total plant biomass and nutrient losses suggest that N losses were more strongly related to plant biomass than P losses. Larger shoot biomass consistently showed lower N losses under both rain regimes, whereas P losses only related negatively to shoot biomass within the moderate rain treatment (Table
