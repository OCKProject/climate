<p class="p">Plants were grown in a climate‐controlled glasshouse and watered regularly, at a constant temperature of 25°C and a day/night cycle of 10/14 hr. Soil water content in microcosms varied between 13% and 15% for the first 30 days of the experiment. After 30 days, microcosms were subjected to two rainfall regimes, a moderate‐intensity rain treatment and a high‐intensity rain treatment. Soil moisture was controlled by weighing microcosms twice a week and before simulated rainfalls to maintain soil moisture between 13% and 15% for the moderate‐intensity rain treatment and between 19% and 21% for the high‐intensity rain treatment (this treatment regularly received a simulated rain—see below). After 13 weeks of growth, plants were clipped 2 cm above ground. The second growing period lasted also 13 weeks and after a total of 26 weeks, above‐ and belowground plant biomass were harvested. Plants were periodically supplied (approximately once each 2 weeks) with a nutrient solution based on Hoagland's (Table
