Seeds of these plant species were surface‐sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite (commercial bleach) for 10 min, thoroughly rinsed with sterile water and germinated on autoclaved dune sand and planted at fixed positions. The plant species and mycorrhizal fungal isolates used in the microcosms all co‐occurred in a dune grassland ecosystem (Provinciale Waterleidingsduinen Noord Holland; Egmond Binnen; coordinates: 521400N, 041390E), which is referred to as the field site. Dune sand was also collected from this site. In the Netherlands, it is common practice to extract ground water from the dunes as drinking water, such as this field side. Commercially available seeds of wild plants that originated from natural populations in the Netherlands were used (Cruydt‐hoeck, Groningen, the Netherlands).
