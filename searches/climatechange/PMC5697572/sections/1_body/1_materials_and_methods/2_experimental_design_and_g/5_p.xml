<p class="p">Overall, the experiment followed a full factorial design, with two factors of two levels each: (i) “AM” (presence and absence of AM fungi) and (ii) “Rain” (moderate and high rain intensity). Therefore, there were four treatment combinations in total, replicated 10 times each. Each microcosm represented an experimental unit and the total number of microcosms was 40.</p>
