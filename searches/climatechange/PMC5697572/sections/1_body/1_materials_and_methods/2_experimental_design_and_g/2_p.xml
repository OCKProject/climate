<p class="p">We carried out a greenhouse experiment with model grassland communities with and without AM fungi for 6 months. We used 2 L microcosms (diameter 17 cm), filled with 2300 g of autoclaved (2 hr at 110°C) dune sand. Half of the microcosms were inoculated with AM fungi and received 200 g of AM fungal inoculum prepared by combining three different AM fungal strains, namely DD2, DD3, and DD5. The remaining half of the microcosms received the same amount of autoclaved inocula. These AM fungal strains originate from the same Dutch dune grassland (see below and described in Scheublin &amp; Van der Heijden, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0043" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>). To identify the AM fungal species, DNA of the three AM fungal isolates was amplified with the PCR primers NS31 and AM1 (Helgason, Daniell, Husband, Fitter, &amp; Young,

 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0028" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1989</xref>). The microbial wash was prepared by wet‐sieving 1000 g of inoculum through a series of sieves (finest sieve was 10 μm) to collect a final volume of 2 L. Each microcosm received 20 ml of microbial wash and a rhizobial suspension with an optical density of 0.24 prepared from isolate nodules of
