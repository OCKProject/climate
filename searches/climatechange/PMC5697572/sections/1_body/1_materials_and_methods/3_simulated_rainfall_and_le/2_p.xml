<p class="p">Simulated rainfall treatments that varied in precipitation amount and frequency of rain events were applied to all microcosms. Moderate rain intensity treatments received one simulated rainfall at the end of each growing period before harvesting (at week 13 and 26), while the high‐intensity rain treatment received a total of 12 simulated rainfalls (weekly during the first growing period and monthly during the second growing period). Rainfall was simulated by using an acrylic cylindrical container 2 L in volume and 14 cm in diameter fitted with 12 capillars of pore diameter (0.5 mm) at its base and provided with a tripod stand following Knacker et al.

Containers were filled up with 500 ml deionized water during the first six rain events and with 700 ml for the last six rain events in the high‐intensity rain treatment. A precipitation event of 500 ml corresponded to 22 mm rainfall and 700 ml precipitation event corresponded to 31 mm rainfall. Microcosms were placed under the cylinder on plastic plates containing gutters circling toward a central nozzle. A rubber tube fitted to this nozzle channeled the leachate into collection bottles (Fig.
