<p class="p">To quantify the intensity of AM fungal colonization in plant roots during the experiment, root samples were collected at the end of the first and second growth period. At the end of the first growth period (before harvest), a soil core of 1.5 cm in diameter, 6 cm long was extracted from each microcosm to sample roots and at the end of the second growth period, three subsamples of roots were set aside from the roots collected from each microcosm. Roots were dried at 70°C for 3 days and kept in paper bags until processing. Dried roots were rehydrated, cleared with 10% KOH for 15 min, washed and subsequently stained with trypan blue for 10 min, both in a water bath at 90°C (Phillips &amp; Hayman,

 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0032" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1990</xref>) was used to determine the percentage of root length colonized by AM fungi. One hundred line intersections were scored at each sample for the presence of hyphae, vesicles, and arbuscules.
