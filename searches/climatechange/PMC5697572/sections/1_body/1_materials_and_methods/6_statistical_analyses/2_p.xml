<p class="p">Differences in nutrient losses and total leachate volume among AM fungal and rain intensity treatments were calculated by generalized least square models using “gls” function from the “nlme” package (Pinheiro, Bates, Debroy, &amp; Sarkar,

 <sup class="sup">−</sup> ‐N losses. Mycorrhizal and rain intensity treatments were treated as categorical factors and plant shoot biomass as a continuous factor to control for its possible influence on leachate properties. The term “weights” was used to account for within‐group heteroskedasticity using “varIdent” function. Pairwise differences were calculated for the interaction between rain and AM treatments using Tukey's post hoc test (significant level set up at 0.05).
