<p class="p">Linear mixed‐effects models were used to test AM impact on leachate losses along each growing period within the high‐intensity rain treatment. The “lme” function was used, setting AM treatment as fixed factor and microcosm identity and volume of simulated rainfall (500 ml/week from Rain 1 to Rain 6; 700 ml/week during Rain 7 and Rain 8; 700 ml/month from Rain 9 to Rain 11) as random factors.</p>
