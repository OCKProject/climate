<p class="p">Linear models were used to test for the effects of rain and AM treatment on shoot and root biomass and factorial MANOVA was used to test for differences on shoot biomass among the plant functional groups composing the model plant community. Differences of AM colonization (total hyphae, vesicles, and arbuscules) between rain intensity treatments were also tested using linear models. Tukey's post hoc tests were used to check for differences among treatments. Response variables were transformed using logarithm, arcsine, or Boxâ€“Cox transformation, when the normality assumption for general lineal models were not achieved.</p>
