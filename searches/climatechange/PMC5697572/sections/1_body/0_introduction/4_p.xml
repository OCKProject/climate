<p class="p">Global warming influences changes in precipitation regimes, which in turn affect terrestrial ecosystem properties (Weltzin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>) such as soil nutrient cycling. Climate models predict wetter winters in Northern Europe and drier summers in Southern Europe, with higher frequency of heavy rainfall events (Christensen, Goodess, Harris, &amp; Watkiss, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0013" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). In Northern European countries, the higher frequency and intensity of rainfalls may result in an increase of leaching rates and hence increase of soil nutrient losses (Austin &amp; Vitousek, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0005" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). By contrast, Mediterranean countries may accumulate inorganic N during dry periods, resulting in higher NO

 <sup class="sup">−</sup> loss after intense rain events that follow dry periods (Austin et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0006" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). To buffer against high soil nutrient losses from ecosystems and the associated nutrient pollution of drained water under altered rainfall patterns, we need to develop appropriate management practices. This is why it is important to address which factors contribute to nutrient retention under different precipitation regimes so that appropriate management practices can be developed. Moreover, in humid environments with regular and intensive rain (e.g., the tropics), efficient nutrient cycling and low losses is of key importance for maintaining long‐term ecosystem fertility.
