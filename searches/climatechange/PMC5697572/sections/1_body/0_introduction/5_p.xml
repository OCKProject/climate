<p class="p">The overall goal of this study was to test whether the management of soil biota can mitigate the negative consequences of climate change and in particular of increased rainfall events. Previous studies on how AM fungi impact nutrient leaching have only used one level of rainfall intensity. The novelty of this study is that we simulated two rainfall scenarios: moderate‐ and high‐intensity rain and simultaneously quantified leaching losses of mineral N and P. An experimental grassland community consisting of forbs, grasses, and legumes with or without AM fungi was subjected to the two rainfall levels. Our main objective was to assess whether the presence of AM fungi buffers against the expected increase in nutrient loss under increased rainfall intensity. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (i) the presence of AM fungi will reduce nutrient losses of mineral N and P under both rain scenarios and (ii) the effects of AM fungi in reducing losses are much stronger under a high‐intensity rainfall scenario.</p>
