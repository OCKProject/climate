<p class="p">The role played by AM fungi in decreasing N loss was crucial in the first rain event, when 80% of the total N loss during the experiment was leached (Fig. 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S3</xref>). Microcosms with presence of AM fungi had 50% less N loss, which corresponds to a decrease of 1.34 kg N/ha after a single rain event. The difference in the amount of N leached between mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal microcosms at the first rain (week 6), is likely due to the presence of a mycorrhizal mycelium that extends into the soil matrix and acquires soil nutrients present in the fine pores that are not accessible to roots. The pots were only slightly fertilized during this experiment and the bigger amount of N loss during the first rain (2.99 kg/ha in nonmycorrhizal microcosms and 1.65 kg/ha in mycorrhizal microcosms) compared to the consecutive 11 simulated rains (0.054 kg/ha average) was probably due to high initial soil nutrient availability and the absence of a well‐developed root system. This result also shows that the presence of AM fungi enhances the nutrient interception ability of soils and decreases the nutrient leaching risk by enhancing nutrient uptake and immobilizing nutrients (Bender, Wagg, &amp; Van der Heijden,
