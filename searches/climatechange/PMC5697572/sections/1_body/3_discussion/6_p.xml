<p class="p">Our results also suggest that AM fungi indirectly influenced N losses by the shift in plant community structure (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). For instance, it may surprise that with increased abundance of legumes and decreased abundance of grasses in the presence of AM fungi, leaching of N is reduced specially at the high rain intensity treatment, given earlier reports of increased N loss with increased abundance of legumes (Scherer‐Lorenzen et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0041" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2003</xref>). However, in our experiment also the abundance of forbs increased with AM fungi as well as total biomass, which can all counteract leaching losses (De Deyn et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Moreover during plant growth, legumes take up and immobilize N in their tissues; therefore, their impact on N leaching may initially be negative but changes over time as their N‐rich roots start to turn over and releases N.
