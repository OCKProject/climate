<p class="p">Overall, our study demonstrates that the mycorrhizal symbiosis in grasslands contribute to multiple ecosystem services such as reducing nutrient loss, improving nutrient cycling, and enhancing plant diversity. As a result, AM fungi enhance ecosystem resilience to changes in precipitation patterns. These findings are of special relevance in habitats were change in rainfall patterns will increase the amount of nutrients lost via leaching. For instance, in agricultural grasslands where there is a large input of N and P through fertilizers or in sandy soils where nutrients rapidly leach after rain events. By reducing N and P loss in the leachate, AM fungi improve nutrient cycling and prevent groundwater nutrient leaching pollution. Similarly, by increasing plant functional diversity and enhancing the abundance of legumes and forbs, AM fungi preserve grasslands multifunctionality (Hector and Bagchi,
