<p class="p">In addition to reducing nutrient loss, AM fungi significantly reduced the volume of leachate. The higher water uptake by plants via mycorrhizal mycelium and increased plant transpiration because of higher plant biomass in mycorrhizal treatments could explain the reduced leaching volume. Moreover, it is known that fungal hyphae improve soil structure by stabilizing soil micro‐ and macro‐aggregates (Miller &amp; Jastrow,

 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>) and this is another way that can affect soil water relations and leaching volume. For instance, Augè (
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>) showed that AM fungi improve soil moisture retention in a sandy soil. In this experiment, we did not measure whether AM fungi induce changes in soil structure via mycorrhizal mycelium; nevertheless, the mycorrhizal mycelium may contribute to enhance water retention. This effect may be more relevant in sandy systems, like in our field site, where the risk of nutrient leaching is high, and the groundwater from such system is used as a source of human drinking water (Piet &amp; Zoeteman,
