<p class="p">Below we discuss the main mechanisms that drive nutrient losses (mineral N and P) under the two rain intensity scenarios. The decrease in P losses was probably caused by the ability of AM fungi to take up soil P. It is well known that the major advantage of AM symbiosis for plants is the increase of P uptake, especially in systems where soil P concentration is low, as in our soil substrate (Smith &amp; Read, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). In our experiment, AM fungi halved the amount of mineral P loss via leaching under both rain regimes (Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>) and this effect was maintained across the experiment. Moreover, mineral P losses decreased with higher mycorrhizal colonization for both moderate and high rain intensity scenarios (Table 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap" class="xref">3</xref>). Maintaining the natural mycorrhizal fungal networks is therefore essential for a sustainable P management, as higher P uptake will result in lower concentrations of the soil phosphates to be leached with rain events, and consequently, lower risk of groundwater contamination. The effect of AM fungi on P losses is especially relevant for sandy soils (such as in this study) or other highly permeable soils where P loss can be substantial (Sims, Simard, &amp; Joern, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1998</xref>). In other soils, P leaching losses are often very low and P loss through surface run‐off is much more important (Sharpley, Mcdowell, &amp; Kleinman, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2001</xref>). Moreover, currently available P resources are becoming increasingly scarce (Cordell &amp; White, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>); therefore, it is crucial to adapt actual land management practices to natural strategies that enhance nutrient use efficiency.
