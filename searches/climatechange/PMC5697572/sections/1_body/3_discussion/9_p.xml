<p class="p">Changes in rainfall patterns will modify the soil water dynamics and related ecosystem processes such as N cycling that is intimately linked to soil moisture. It is expected that increased precipitation will enhance the number of wet–dry cycles and increase nitrification and denitrification processes (Knapp et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>). For instance, higher precipitation intensity enhances the period of time that the soil is saturated with water and therefore denitrification increases. In our experiment, anaerobic conditions were more frequent in the high rain intensity treatment as it received 12 simulated rainfalls, while the moderate rain intensity treatment only received two simulated rainfalls. Still, we expect that the anaerobic conditions were of short duration as soil moisture after the rain events quickly dropped due to the texture of the substrate used (dune sand is mainly composed by large sand particles with hardly any clary or silt). When oxygen levels are not limiting, higher soil moisture enhances ecosystem activity such as plant nutrients uptake and N mineralization. Therefore, we expect that under water excess there will be higher N losses both via gaseous emissions (NO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub> to N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O) and via leaching when N availability exceeds N‐uptake. Our results together with previous studies that have shown that AM fungi can decrease N
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O fluxes (Bender et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) especially under moist conditions (Lazcano, Barrios‐Masias, &amp; Jackson, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0029" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), highlight the importance of AM fungi to prevent N loss in wet ecosystems.
