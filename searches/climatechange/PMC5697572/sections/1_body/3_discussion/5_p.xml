<p class="p">The ability of AM fungi to decrease mineral N losses was clear in the high rain intensity scenario, where AM fungi reduced total N loss by 40% (from 3.66 kg N/ha to 2.22 kg N/ ha in nonmycorrhizal to mycorrhizal microcosms, respectively; Figure 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Accordingly, AM fungal colonization negatively correlated with the amount of N lost in the high‐intensity rain regime (Table

 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>) and highlights the relevance of AM fungi to retain soil nutrients especially in ecosystems with higher precipitation rates. At the moderate rain intensity scenario, we did not find an effect of the presence of AM fungi on N loss via leachate; however, under this rain regime, the amount of N loss was very small (0.06 kg N/ha). The potential of AM fungi to retain nutrients may be much higher in systems with high N losses (e.g., in some agricultural areas up to an estimated 160 kg N/ha year is lost through leaching [Bender &amp; Van der Heijden,

 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>], much more compared to values observed in this experiment). Here we focused on N leaching losses, while we did not measure gaseous N losses through the process of denitrification (e.g., Bender et al.,
