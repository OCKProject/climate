<p class="p">The AM fungal symbiosis provided additional benefits to the plant community. For instance, the presence of AM fungi enhanced shoot biomass, plant community evenness and plant diversity. High plant community evenness is essential to preserve grasslands multifunctionality (Hector and Bagchi, 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0505" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>), including increased resilience of grassland ecosystems to changing climate conditions (Isbell et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0024" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). AM fungi enhanced growth of forbs and legumes and changed plant community structure from grass‐dominated systems to others where grasses, forbs, and legumes had similar abundance. Such shifts are highly relevant in the context of nutrient leaching, as earlier studies showed that differences in the total biomass of the plant community and in the relative abundance of the plant functional groups can influence the amount of nutrient loss in grassland systems (De Deyn et al.,
