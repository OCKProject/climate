<p class="p">Our data show that AM fungi can decrease rain‐induced nutrient losses by leaching. Moreover, the extent to which AM fungi contribute to reduced mineral N loss depends on rainfall intensity; the presence of AM fungi had the biggest contribution to the reduction of mineral N loss when rainfall intensity was high. We also confirmed that the beneficial effect of AM fungi at reducing mineral P loss via leaching (Asghari et al.,

This highlights the importance of AM fungi for sustainable nutrient cycling and thus, for ecosystem resilience. This is especially relevant in areas with high rainfall intensity (such as the tropics) where high precipitation rates will cause major nutrient losses via leaching. In addition, this finding is important for ecosystems that will experience increased rainfall due to climate change. While earlier studies reported that AM fungi can reduce nutrient leaching losses from agricultural and natural settings (e.g., Cavagnaro et al., 
 <xref rid="gcb13785-bib-0012" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>), this study shows that this function of AM fungi is maintained, and even improved, when rainfall intensity is higher.
