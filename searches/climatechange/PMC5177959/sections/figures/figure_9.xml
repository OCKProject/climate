  <title class="title">Predictive-skill curves based on Pearson correlation coefficients for convergent cross-mapping of aeolian desertification land area with the possible influencing factors.</title>
  <p class="p">Dotted lines on either side of the predictive-skill curves represent the Â±standard deviation of estimate assessed from bootstrapping based on 1000 iterations. Convergent cross-mapping is based on procedures written in the R-programming language initially developed by Clark
