Desertification means the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration falls within the range from 0.05 to 0.65; and evapotranspiration is highly related to temperature. Wind is the power of desertification. Meanwhile, population is one of the most important anthropogenic factors of desertification.
