<p class="p">Land degradation and desertification has been ranked as a major environmental and social issue in the coming decades in China. It has received a great attention, especially the northern China. Desertification area in China has increased since the 1950s and reached its maximum during the 1970s and early 1980s. Since then desertification area has decreased continuously to the present

Small field experiments prove that vegetation in desertified/degraded land could recover if isolated from human activities. Since 1998, natural recovery has become one powerful national force to prevent land desertification and recover natural vegetation
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" class="xref">17</xref>, so anthropogenic factors are not the main factor exacerbating the desertification distribution during 2001 to 2015 in northern China. Numerous scientists have claimed that land desertification in China is primarily due to human impacts. Wang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref> suggested that desertification in China has been primarily caused by climate change
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15" class="xref">15</xref>. We also believed that desertification in northern China is mainly controlled by natural factors during the past 15 years. In addition, although overall land desertification area decreases year by year, desertification situation in some regions shows the worsened tendency, such as regions around rivers and lakes. We must pay more attention to environment deterioration of rivers, lakes and the nearby areas in the future. In this study, the proposed NDDI is able to obtain the aeolian desertification land distribution on a large scale and assess the aeolian desertification area variability simply and effectively. The results show that aeolian desertification area with population indicates feedback (bi-directional causality) between the two variables (P &lt; 0.05). Forcing of aeolian desertification area by population is weak (P = 0.046). However, aeolian desertification area forcing population has more significant signal (P = 0.02). In fact, land desertification in northern China is affected by anthropogenic factors with small fluctuation. Once the land desertification happens, it will bring population migration with population growth pressure around desertification regions. Based on the same diagnostic tests as we used above, we find aeolian desertification area is significantly affected by temperature, as expected. However, there is no obvious forcing for the aeolian desertification area and precipitation. We supposed several situations about this: (i) there is a small fluctuation for the precipitation in northern China during the past 15 years, so we derived no obvious causality; (ii) precipitation is not the root cause of land desertification. Aeolian desertification area with wind speed indicates feedback (bi-directional causality) between the two variables with significant signal (P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, we infer that aeolian desertification is greatly affected by natural factors compared with anthropogenic factors. From the result, aeolian desertification area covers a large area in northern China threatening human life. If the desertification land area continues to grow, it will reduce the habitable zone and lead to a large number of population migration and growth

For the desertification in China, we are greatly convinced that desertification prevention is better than control. We should pay more attention to the impact of climate change on the desertification distribution. Further, there are still many challenges in estimation of eolian desertification land area. The simulation time only chooses 15 years (2001–2015), and limited impact factors including precipitation, temperature, wind speed and population were used to analyze the cause-and-effect relationship. More field survey data in combination of more high spatial resolution images should also be adopted in the further research.
