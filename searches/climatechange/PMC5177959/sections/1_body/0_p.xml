<p class="p">Desertification is a type of land degradation in which a relatively dry land region becomes increasingly arid, typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife. It is caused by a variety of factors, such as climate change and human activities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1" class="xref">1</xref>. Meanwhile aeolian desertification is the most important desertification type in China with serious environmental and socioeconomic problems in arid, semi-arid, and dry sub- humid zones. Continuous aeolian desertification has a serious influence on the biosphere. It is also highly related to issues such as declining productivity, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and declining ecosystem services
