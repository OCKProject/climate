<p class="p">It is a problem to achieve the combination of high and low resolution remote sensing data. In this study, the first step was to establish a 1 km × 1 km grid frame (consistent with the resolution of re-sampled MODIS) with vector format and each grid was identified with a unique identity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>). The second step was to use this frame to respectively perform statistical analysis for SVM classification result by GF-1 data in each grid. Finally, calculate the proportion of each land use type in each grid frame. Taking the proportion of aeolian desertification area was greater than 70% as the pure pixel for aeolian desertification land, the proportion of vegetation (others) area was greater than 90% as the pure pixel for vegetation (others). Then changes of reflectance values for different land use types were acquired. Total correlation index(r) value of all types between band1 and band2 was the lowest. Band1 and band2 exhibited a large disparity in their spectral responses of different land covers. So these two bands were used to derive Normalized Difference Desertification Index (NDDI) in this study.
