 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref> was used to compare the MODIS-NDDI time series image of aeolian desertification land with the MODIS-NDDI image of the study area for each pixel. A lower image value illustrated a closer MAD, which indicated a greater possibility of aeolian desertification. A threshold was set on the MAD map based on the prior knowledge, by considering the official data of aeolian desertification area. The difference between the estimated aeolian desertification area and the official data was smallest when the threshold value is 0.051. In this study, a p-tile algorithm was adopted for threshold selection
