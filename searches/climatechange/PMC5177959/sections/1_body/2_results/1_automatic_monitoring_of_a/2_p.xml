<p class="p">GF-1 remote sensing image was classified by Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithm. The main land cover type obtained by this algorithm is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4" class="xref">Fig. 4</xref>. Results show that the SVM classification algorithm can meet the precision requirements based on visual interpretation of GF-1.
