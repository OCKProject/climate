<p class="p">Taking a part of GF-1 data as the experimental data (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2</xref>), three fusion algorithms as commonly used in the image fusion experiments were applied. Mean and standard deviation values of fusion image using multiplicative algorithm are far from raw image (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3a</xref>,b). Entropy and correlation coefficient values of fusion image using PCA algorithm are greater than Brovey Transform (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3" class="xref">Fig. 3c</xref>,d). It shows that Principal Component Analysis (PCA) image fusion algorithm is the best choice for GF-1 data fusion (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Then PCA image fusion algorithm was finally used on entire GF-1 data.
