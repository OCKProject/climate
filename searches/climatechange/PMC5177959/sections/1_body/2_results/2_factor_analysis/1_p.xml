<p class="p">Generally, desertification means the ratio of annual precipitation to potential evapotranspiration falls within the range from 0.05 to 0.65; and evapotranspiration is highly related to temperature. Wind is the power of desertification. Meanwhile, population is one of the most important anthropogenic factors of desertification. So temperature, precipitation and wind speed as the natural factors and population as the anthropogenic factor in combination of CCM model were used to analyze cause-and-effect relationship in this study (
