<p class="p">Based solely on the relationship between library length and Pearson correlation coefficient, results for this CCM test suggest that aeolian desertification area with population indicates feedback (bi-directional causality) between the two variables (P &lt; 0.05; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Fig. 9a</xref>), but forcing of aeolian desertification area by population is weak. Based on the same diagnostic tests as we used above, we find aeolian desertification area is significantly affected by temperature, as expected (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Fig. 9b</xref>). However, there is no obvious forcing for the aeolian desertification area and precipitation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Fig. 9c</xref>). Aeolian desertification area with wind speed indicates feedback (bi-directional causality) between the two variables with significant signal (P &lt; 0.01; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f9" class="xref">Fig. 9d</xref>).
