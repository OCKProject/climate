<p class="p">In this study, the main processes to effectively estimate aeolian desertification land distribution include: (1) two aeolian desertification sensitive bands (band1 and band2) of MODIS09A1 were selected to calculate Normalized Difference Desertification Index (NDDI); (2) standard image of aeolian desertification land was generated by mean MODIS-NDDI time series curve of aeolian desertification land; (3) Mean Absolute Distance(MAD) was calculated between the MODIS-NDDI time series image and the standard image of aeolian desertification land; (4) aeolian desertification distribution from 2001 to 2015 was obtained; then spatial-temporal change of aeolian desertification area and its possible influencing factors were analyzed, such as precipitation, temperature, wind speed and population by Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) model.</p>
