<p class="p">Gaofen-1(GF-1) was launched on April 26, 2013 from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center. The civilian High-Definition Earth Observation Satellite (HDEOS) program was proposed in 2006 and received approval in 2010. Gaofen-1 is the first of six planned HDEOS spacecraft to be launched between 2013 and 2016. The satellite’s primary goal is to provide Near-Real-Time (NRT) observations for disaster prevention and relief, climate change monitoring, geographical mapping, environmental and resource surveying, as well as precision agriculture support. The GF-1 multispectral data have four bands with spatial resolution of 8 m and panchromatic data with spatial resolution of 2 m. Data fusion and geometric correction was carried using ERDAS software with multispectral and panchromatic data of GF-1.</p>
