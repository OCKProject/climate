It provides eight days composite with a 500 m spatial resolution data. The red bands such as band1 (620–670 nm), near-infrared bands such as band2 (841–876 nm), blue bands such as band3 (459–479 nm), green bands such as band4 (545–565 nm) of MODIS for each date and tile were extracted, mosaicked, clipped to the extent of study area and resampled to 1000 m resolution data.
