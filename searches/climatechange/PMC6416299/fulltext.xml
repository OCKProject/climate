Multiple airbursts/impacts produced the YD boundary layer (YDB), depositing peak concentrations of platinum, high-temperature spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds, forming an isochronous datum at &#x0003e;50 sites across ~50 million km&#x000b2; of Earth&#x02019;s surface. This proposed event triggered extensive biomass burning, brief impact winter, YD climate change, and contributed to extinctions of late Pleistocene megafauna. In the most extensive investigation south of the equator, we report on a ~12,800-year-old sequence at Pilauco, Chile (~40&#x000b0;S), that exhibits peak YD boundary concentrations of platinum, gold, high-temperature iron- and chromium-rich spherules, and native iron particles rarely found in nature. A major peak in charcoal abundance marks an intense biomass-burning episode, synchronous with dramatic changes in vegetation, including a high-disturbance regime, seasonality in precipitation, and warmer conditions. This is anti-phased with northern-hemispheric cooling at the YD onset, whose rapidity suggests atmospheric linkage. The sudden disappearance of megafaunal remains and dung fungi in the YDB layer at Pilauco correlates with megafaunal extinctions across the Americas. The Pilauco record appears consistent with YDB impact evidence found at sites on four continents.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002850</institution-id><institution>Fondo Nacional de Desarrollo Cient&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;fico y Tecnol&#x00026;amp;#x00F3;gico (National Fund for Scientific and Technological Development)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1150738</award-id><award-id>1100555</award-id><award-id>3170958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pino</surname><given-names>Mario</given-names></name><name><surname>Astorga</surname><given-names>Giselle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>TAQUACH/Vicerrector&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;a de Desarrollo, Investigaci&#x00026;amp;#x00F3;n y Creaci&#x00026;amp;#x00F3;n Art&#x00026;amp;#x00ED;stica (VIDCA), Universidad Austral de Chile</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>University of California Santa Barbara, Academic Senate Faculty Research Grant</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">The YDB impact hypothesis posits that the hemisphere-wide debris field of a large, fragmenting asteroid/comet struck Earth and caused brief &#x0201c;impact winter&#x0201d; conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. In turn, this triggered major shifts in continental drainage patterns, dramatically changed oceanic circulation, and caused abrupt global climate changes (temperature and precipitation) marked by the Younger Dryas (YD) climatic episode in the Northern Hemisphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The airburst/impacts are proposed to have caused significant environmental changes, including widespread biomass burning, anomalously abrupt shifts in plant and animal distributions, human cultural changes and population declines, and broad extinctions within the iconic late Pleistocene megafauna<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Studies of the Younger Dryas boundary (YDB) layer report peak abundances of a diverse suite of proposed cosmic impact-related proxies at more than 50 sites, located mostly within the Northern Hemisphere, but with two previous sites in the Southern Hemisphere (Venezuela<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and Antarctica<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>). These include peak abundances of high-temperature high-iron (Fe) spherules, glassy silica-rich spherules, high-temperature meltglass, nanodiamonds, platinum (Pt), iridium (Ir), osmium (Os), and/or other impact-related proxies (for references, cf. Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A2</xref> in Wolbach <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>). The YDB layer is also often marked by abundance peaks in biomass-burning proxies, including charcoal, aciniform carbon/soot, carbon spherules, glasslike carbon and/or combustion aerosols<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. This entire suite of proxies at the YD onset is argued to represent one of the largest known biomass-burning peaks of the late Quaternary<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">First proposed in 2007<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, the YDB impact hypothesis is still controversial a decade later because a number of independent studies have raised questions about the proposed YDB impact event. (1) The authors of several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> have argued that dating accuracy and precision are insufficient to determine whether YDB proxies are coeval across the many sites. (2) Five of 13 independent studies were unable to confirm the presence of peaks in YDB magnetic spherules (see Supplementary Information, &#x0201c;Previously reported evidence of YDB magnetic spherules&#x0201d; for details). (3) Three studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> noted that sediment sampling at YDB sites is typically discontinuous, except at and around the YDB layer, where sampling spanned at most a few thousand years, making it difficult to know whether the &#x0201c;impact assemblage&#x0201d; of indicators is unique to the YDB (Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The same concern applies to this study in which we sampled continuously at high resolution for ~300 years across the YDB layer and sporadically before and after, totalling ~17,000 years. (4) In one study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, it was argued that the proposed YDB impact mechanism of a fragmented comet is so rare as to be statistically implausible. (5) Several investigators<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> proposed that the rate and timing of megafaunal extinctions were not simultaneous but varied across the continents, with a large percentage of them occurring prior to the YDB. (6) Another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> concluded that a major peak in wildfire activity preceded the YD onset by several hundred years and did not correlate with the YD onset. (7) It was argued in several studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup> that individual &#x0201c;impact indicators&#x0201d; are also produced by non-impact processes, thus not requiring an impact. Finally, (8) another study<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> argued that YD climate change had little effect on people and their animal prey across the central portion of the US. For a limited number of selected contributions relevant to this hypothesis, see Supplementary Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">A3</xref> of Wolbach <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup></p><p id="Par4">Proponents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> of the YDB impact hypothesis concede that individual proxies might have formed through alternative processes, but argue that coeval abundance peaks for the <italic>entire suite</italic> of proxies in the same stratum is unique to cosmic impact events. For example, the same suite of proxies has been found in the well-known Cretaceous-Tertiary (K-T) boundary layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> (~65.5 million years ago), forming a global datum layer. Similarly, the 780,000-year-old Australasian impact event dispersed small amounts of microscopic spherules and impact glass across ~30% of the planet&#x02019;s surface, forming the largest known impact strewnfield<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, for which no physical crater has been found. As with the K-T and Australasian impact events, the YDB layer contains a suite of impact proxies within a datum layer that can also be used for global correlation and dating. Impact proponents argue that the YDB datum layer is precisely equivalent in age to the onset of the YD cooling episode recorded in the Greenland ice sheet and in many other stratigraphic sections in the Northern Hemisphere<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Regardless of differing hypotheses about the YDB suite&#x02019;s origin, this layer forms a valuable datum for global correlation and dating.</p><p id="Par5">An important new development includes the discovery by Kjaer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> of a giant, 31-km-wide, possible YDB-aged impact crater under the Hiawatha Glacier in northwestern Greenland, calculated to have been produced by a 1.5-km-wide impactor. This is the 25th largest known terrestrial crater, the largest in the last ~5 million years (52-km-wide Kara-Kul crater in Tajikistan), and the second largest in the last ~35.3 million years (40-km-wide Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, USA). Impact proxies include high-temperature spherules, meltglass, amorphous carbon, and elevated concentrations of Ni, Co, Cr, PGEs (e.g., Pt, Ir, and Os), and Au<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, all of which are also elevated at YDB sites on four continents.</p><p id="Par6">Kjaer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> conclude that the potential age range of the impact event spans the YD onset, although the crater is as yet undated. The potential for a YDB age is based on several lines of evidence: (1) Post-YDB annual ice layers are present from the Younger Dryas (12,800 to 11,700&#x02009;cal BP) through the Holocene (11,700&#x02009;cal BP to modern times), but undisturbed pre-YDB ice layers are missing. However, four widely distributed, distinctive, radar-reflecting, pre-YDB ice layers, including the youngest that spans the B&#x000f8;lling-Aller&#x000f8;d (14,700 to 12,800&#x02009;cal BP), are missing within the crater and within 100&#x02009;km around it, consistent with having been disrupted by the impact event. (2) There is evidence of hydrothermal activity within the crater beneath the overlying 930-meter-thick ice sheet, as would be expected from residual heat generated by a young impact. If such activity had been caused by an impact event, it would be short-lived because the continuing melting of ice cover over the crater would efficiently dissipate the heat. Therefore, ongoing hydrothermal activity is consistent with a very young age for the crater. (3) The subglacial crater rim and basin appear relatively fresh and minimally eroded, consistent with a young crater<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>. If the crater were very old, the rim is expected to be much more subdued, due to the erosive effects of glacial ice movements, as is apparent with many once-subglacial Canadian crater rims that were flattened by movement of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. (4) Kjaer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> report PGE anomalies in the crater derived from an ET impact event. This is similar to the results of Petaev <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>, who analyzed Greenland ice and report an abundance peak in Pt spanning 21 years from 12,836&#x02013;12,815&#x02009;cal BP. They attributed this to multiple injections of Pt from a large extraterrestrial impact event, possibly now identified with the Hiawatha Crater. Kjaer <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> conclude that such a massive impact event &#x0201c;very likely had significant environmental consequences in the Northern Hemisphere and possibly globally.&#x0201d; If so, this impact event may have triggered climate change in southern Chile, which we explore in this contribution.</p><p id="Par7">The Chilean Council of National Monuments has protected the unique Pilauco site as an important paleontological and archaeological resource because of its rich and abundant assemblage of extinct South American Pleistocene mammals and cultural remains. Prior descriptions of the stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronology of this well-exposed sedimentary sequence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> provide the foundation for our investigations, and the high sedimentation rate offers high chronological resolution. Previous radiocarbon dating (9 dates<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>) has shown that the sequence includes the estimated age span of the YDB impact event (~12,835 to 12,735&#x02009;cal BP)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study, we conducted time series material analyses across the sedimentary sequence to determine changes in concentrations of Pt, palladium (Pd), high-temperature magnetic spherules, charcoal, plant macrofossils, pollen, and dung fungal spores (<italic>Sporormiella</italic> spp.). Also, the Pilauco stratigraphic sequence has provided an unprecedented opportunity to compare the regional megafaunal extinctions at high resolution with similar coeval extinctions in the Northern Hemisphere. We have also undertaken quantitative pollen and seed analyses across the boundary layer for paleoclimatic and paleo-environmental assessments and for comparison with YD climatic change as determined from sequences in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><p id="Par8">The Pilauco site is the most extensively investigated YDB sequence south of the equator, but is also at high southern latitudes (~40&#x000b0;S) more than 6000&#x02009;km farther south than the closest well-studied YDB site in Venezuela<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.

Despite pollen concentrations that decrease dramatically after the YDB (10&#x000d7; from 68,811 to 6,372 grains/cc), pollen is sufficiently abundant and diverse in the post-YDB sequence for the interpretation of broad environmental trends, especially when evaluated in the context of previous regional records. At the YD onset, drier conditions are indicated by the disappearance of aquatic ferns (<italic>Isoetes</italic> sp.; grids 10AD and 14AD), following their persistent presence throughout the pre-YDB sequence. These changes were also accompanied by increased biomass burning fostered by the onset of a marked seasonality of rainfall and warmer conditions. Furthermore, beginning at the YDB layer the vegetation records show a distinct upward increase (from 5 to 20%) of pioneering/colonizing taxa indicative of more disturbed open habitats (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">13</xref>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref></sup>.

As such, the vegetation history at Pilauco records a sudden shift at the YDB from cooler, wetter conditions characteristic of the North Patagonian forest to seasonally drier and warmer conditions of the Valdivian rainforest.

This, in turn, strongly reduced North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and curtailed production of North Atlantic Intermediate Waters, further strengthening cooling and sea-ice expansion in the Northern Hemisphere. This major change in circulation in the Northern Hemisphere helped to stimulate Antarctic deep-water production in the Southern Hemisphere and its northward expansion in the world&#x02019;s oceans.

Sediment samples of approximately 50 grams each were collected by M.P. and Javiera Barria and then sent for analysis by Activation Laboratories (ActLabs), Canada using their &#x0201c;1C-Research&#x0201d; package. The package includes fire-assay (FA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure elemental concentrations of Pt, Pd, and Au. Prior to analysis, each sample was mixed with fire assay fluxes (borax, soda ash, silica, litharge) and silver (Ag) was added as a collector. The mixture was placed in a crucible and preheated to 850&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, intermediately heated at 950&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, and finished at 1060&#x02009;&#x000b0;C for a total of 60&#x02009;minutes. After the crucibles were removed from the assay furnace, the molten slag was poured into a mold leaving a lead button. The lead button was then preheated to 950&#x02009;&#x000b0;C to recover the Ag (dor&#x000e9; bead) mixed with the extracted Au, Pt and Pd. The Ag dor&#x000e9; bead was digested in hot (95&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) HNO<sub>3&#x02009;+&#x02009;</sub>HCl with a special complexing agent to prevent the Au, Pd, and Pt from adsorbing onto the test tube. After cooling for 2&#x02009;hours, the sample solution was analyzed for Au, Pt, and Pd using a Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 9000 ICP-MS. On each tray of 42 samples there were 2 method blanks, 3 sample duplicates, and 2 certified reference materials. The ICP-MS was recalibrated every 45 samples. Smaller sample splits were used for high-chromium and sulfide samples. Measurements are reported in parts per billion (ppb) with a lower limit of detection for Pt of 0.1 ppb. All control testing indicated that the analyses were accurate and replicable.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Analyses of plant remains</title><p id="Par93">The same 138-cm-thick profile examined for the presence of impact spherules in grid 8AD was also investigated for plant remains (fruits, seeds, capsules, cuticles). Sediment samples were collected and analyzed by M.P., Daniel Fritte, and Javiera Barria. The sediment samples were wet sieved through a series of sieves (2&#x02009;mm to 63&#x02009;&#x000b5;m) for the separation of gravel, sand, and mud. Next, the fractions were oven-dried at 60&#x02009;&#x000b0;C, dry weighed, and stored in plastic bags for further examination. The fractions from each sample were examined under a stereomicroscope at 10&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;to 40&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;magnification for the picking and sorting of reproductive structures (i.e., seeds, fruits and capsules; hereinafter referred to as seeds) and leaf cuticles. Plant remains were analyzed by G.A. at the Universidad Austral de Chile, in Valdivia.</p><p id="Par94">Numerical analyses were performed only on the seed data because of the high fragmentation of cuticle remains and uncertainty in knowing the number of individual leaves from which the cuticle fragments were derived. We tested whether variation of our count response variable (number of seeds) for units PB-8 and PB-9 was affected by different sample sizes (thickness and/or total weight of the sample). To do so, we fitted a Poisson GLM regression, in which the dependent variable is allowed to have a non-normal distribution. This regression holds that any observed response is a linear sum of multiple underlying individual responses. Because we detected over-dispersion (greater than expected variance from the mean), a correction of the standard errors was performed using a quasi-GLM model specifying the mean and variance relationship (i.e., variance given by &#x003c6;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;&#x003bc;, where &#x003bc; is the mean and &#x003c6; the dispersion parameter), following the method of Zuur <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref></sup>.

This technique assumes that mean spacings between calibrated ages are inversely proportional to the size of extinct megafaunal populations (i.e., smaller intervals mean larger populations). To avoid inaccuracies introduced by the use of multiple calibration curves, we did not use calibrated dates from the original studies. Instead, co-author A.W. recalibrated all original radiocarbon dates with the OxCal program, version 4.3.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref></sup>, using SHCal13, the radiocarbon calibration curve for the Southern Hemisphere. After inverting the age intervals to identify the point at which the megafaunal populations began to decrease before full extinction, we used linear regression with breakpoints, estimated through lowess smoothing.

Duplicates were eliminated. The dates were ranked in quality from 11 to 17 by the original authors based on multiple factors (e.g., the kind of material dated, the association of the dated material with the taxon or event that was being dated, and the method of dating (AMS or standard)). Dates lower than the rank of 11 were excluded from this study because, as suggested by Barnosky and Lindsey<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref></sup>, lower-ranked dates are considered to be insufficiently robust.
