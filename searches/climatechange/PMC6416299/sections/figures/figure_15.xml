  <p class="p">Grid map of megafaunal (proboscidean) bone and human lithic distributions. Bones (gray) mapped during the excavation are oriented to the SW-NE (23%) and SSW-NNE. Orientation of the proboscidean bones suggests the animals died 
   <italic class="italic">in situ</italic>. Carnivores were possibly responsible for alteration and/or removal of some bones. Purple numbers represent the quantity of human lithics found in each grid. There is no current evidence that humans modified the bones, although the presence of numerous closely associated lithics suggests significant human interaction with the extinct proboscidean remains.
