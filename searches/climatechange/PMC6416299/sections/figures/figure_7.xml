   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Group 1 high-temperature Fe-rich spherules (red dots) are compositionally unlike known anthropogenic spherules (blue dots) and unlike Group 5 anthropogenic spherules (green triangles) found at the surface of the profile in grid 8AD. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Group 1 spherules are compositionally different from known volcanic spherules (black triangles), which are geochemically similar to Group 3 Pilauco spherules (orange squares) thought to be volcanic in origin. (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Group 1 spherules are geochemically similar to some cosmic spherules (blue diamonds) indicating that some YDB layer spherules at Pilauco might be cosmic in origin. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Group 1 spherules also are compositionally similar to spherules produced as ejecta during known cosmic impact events. Comparative data of non-Pilauco material are from TableÂ
