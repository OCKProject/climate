  <p class="p">Statistical analyses of megafaunal radiocarbon dates. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Summed probability for 171 previously reported radiocarbon dates on megafaunal remains mostly from southern Chile and Argentina. The highest peak in stacked radiocarbon dates occurs at ~12,720 ± 25 cal BP, immediately below the YDB impact layer. (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Spacing analysis of the same 171 radiocarbon dates, clustering at ~12,790 ± 25 cal BP. Gray trend line represents a linear regression, and the light gray dotted line represents lowess smoothing of the data. Green circles are pre-YDB in age and blue circles are post-YDB. Both trend lines indicate a general increase in numbers of radiocarbon dates from ~16,000 to ~12,800 cal BP, followed by a conspicuous decline in the number of dates, which is inferred to represent a major decline in megafaunal populations. The large peak in both plots at ~12,800 cal BP appears to be the time at which the YDB cosmic impact abruptly triggered large megafauna declines, including extinctions and extirpations of many taxa, later followed by full extinction of the remaining taxa.
