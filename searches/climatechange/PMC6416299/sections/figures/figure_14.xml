   </sup>. Blue vertical bar represents cooler climate during the Antarctic Cold Reversal, anti-phased with the warm Bølling-Allerød episode in the Northern Hemisphere. Orange vertical bar represents warmer climate in Antarctic coeval with Younger Dryas cooling in the Northern Hemisphere. Blue and red arrows indicate colder or warmer temperature changes, respectively, across the Antarctic Cold Reversal and the Younger Dryas.
