   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) seed record collected in grid 8AD. Blue bands represent pre-YDB sediments (PB-8) and light red bands are post-YDB (PB-9) sediments. Non-arboreal taxa made up most of the local vegetation (40% to 85%). Below the YDB layer, North Patagonian taxa were dominant reflecting cooler, wetter climatic conditions. Coincident with the YDB, the North Patagonian forest elements were replaced by those of the Valdivian rainforest, marking a major shift to somewhat drier, warmer climate. Disturbed/pioneer taxa and ferns also show a dramatic increase at the beginning of the YDB layer associated with major fire regime.
