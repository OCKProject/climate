  <p class="p">Changes in impact-related and environmental proxies at the PB-8/PB-9 boundary (YDB), showing peak concentrations of high-temperature impact spherules, framboids, and elemental proxies, including Pt, along with changes in charcoal and plant macrofossil abundances. (
   <bold class="bold">a</bold>) Group 1: high-temperature, Fe- and Si-rich impact spherules exhibit a peak abundance of ~520/kg at ~552 cm; (
   <bold class="bold">b</bold>) Group 2: Cr-rich spherules have a peak abundance of ~115/kg at ~552 cm; (
   <bold class="bold">c</bold>) Group 4: authigenic framboids have a peak abundance of ~80/kg at ~554 cm. (
   <bold class="bold">d</bold>) Stratigraphic profile of grid 8AD. Age of PB-8/PB-9 boundary is 12,770 ± 160 cal yr BP. (
   <bold class="bold">e</bold>) Pt abundance peak of 9.9 ppb in the YDB layer at 551 cm coincident with the boundary of units PB-8 and PB-9. (
   <bold class="bold">f</bold>) Anomalous Pt/Pd ratios are restricted to the PB-8/PB-9 boundary suggesting the influx of non-local Pt at the YDB. (
   <bold class="bold">g</bold>) Anomalous Au/Pt ratios are also restricted to the PB-8/PB-9 boundary suggesting the influx of non-local Au at higher concentrations than those of the non-local Pt. (
   <bold class="bold">h</bold>) Photograph of sampling section in grid 8AD. Green pins mark sampling levels. (
   <bold class="bold">i</bold>) Abundance record of seeds showing the major decline at the YDB layer. (
   <bold class="bold">j</bold>) Pollen concentrations showing the abrupt decline in the YDB layer. (
   <bold class="bold">k</bold>) Abrupt increase in charcoal peaking at the YDB layer with continuing high concentrations in the overlying ~10 cm. (
   <bold class="bold">l</bold>) Stratigraphic profile for grid 10AD. Group 3 volcanic spherules were found in low concentrations throughout the profile in grid 8AD (not plotted here; see Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11a</xref>). Group 5 anthropogenic spherules were restricted to surface sediments in grid 8AD (not plotted here; see Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11b</xref>). Group 6 rounded detrital grains (not plotted) are common throughout the entire profile. Legend is the same as in Fig.
