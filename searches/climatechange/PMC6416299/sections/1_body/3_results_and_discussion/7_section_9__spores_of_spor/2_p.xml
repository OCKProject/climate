<p id="Par66" class="p">At Pilauco, the sediment layers below the YDB (units PB-7 and PB-8) contain persistent but variable concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp. spores in association with common megafaunal bones (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig" class="xref">16a</xref>). Maximum concentrations of 
 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp. spores were found in the lower part of unit PB-7 (1,540 spores cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>) at ~16,500 cal BP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig" class="xref">16b</xref>) and in the upper part of unit PB-8 (1,800 spores cm
 <sup class="sup">−3</sup>), which is immediately below the YDB layer (PB-8/PB-9 boundary). Above this boundary, 
 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp. spores abruptly disappear from the record, indicating a major megafaunal population decline or extinction. Spores reappear in much lower numbers hundreds of years later near the top of unit PB-9 most likely caused by an inferred influx of modern herbivorous fauna such as 
 <italic class="italic">Lama guanicoe</italic>, 
 <italic class="italic">Hippocamelus bisulcus</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">Pudu puda</italic>.
