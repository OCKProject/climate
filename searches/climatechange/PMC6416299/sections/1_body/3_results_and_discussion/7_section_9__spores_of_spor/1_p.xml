 </sup>. To enhance our biostratigraphic investigation of the Pilauco megafauna and their extinctions, we quantified the vertical distribution in these sediments of coprophilous fungi spores (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp., 
 <italic class="italic">Sordaria</italic> spp., and 
 <italic class="italic">Posospora</italic> spp.). These spores are commonly found in the faeces of livestock, such as cows and horses, as well as in that of extinct megaherbivores such as mammoths, ground sloths, and horses

 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp. spore concentrations are a reliable local-scale proxy of megaherbivore population sizes

 <italic class="italic">Sporormiella</italic> spp. spores was established after the discovery of a layer of fossilized mammoth dung in Bechan Cave, Utah

 </sup>. Variations in abundance of these coprophilous fungi in Pleistocene- and Holocene-aged sediments are considered to be directly proportional to the local abundance of megaherbivores, and thus to provide a reliable indicator of the presence, relative abundance, decline, and extinction of megafauna populations on several continents
