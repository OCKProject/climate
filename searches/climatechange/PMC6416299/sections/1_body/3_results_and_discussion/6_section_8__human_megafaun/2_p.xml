<p id="Par64" class="p">Lithics produced by the first human settlers at Pilauco are only found in close association with megafaunal remains. This observed connection suggests that humans were exploiting extinct megafauna through scavenging and/or hunting. No human artifacts were found after the extinction of the megafauna at the YDB layer and PB-8/PB-9 boundary. This absence of remains suggests that humans either abandoned the area after the megafaunal extinctions and/or experienced a regional population decline and/or reorganization, similar to that proposed for North America
