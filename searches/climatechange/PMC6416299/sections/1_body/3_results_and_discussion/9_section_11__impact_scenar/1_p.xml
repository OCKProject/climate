 </sup> Summarizing that discussion, astronomical discoveries over the last few decades show that mass distribution of comets appears to be disproportionately large for bodies with diameters near and up to 300 km, representing a greater hazard for Earth impacts. A 250-km comet with typical density of 0.5 g/cm³ has 1000 times the mass of the entire current near-Earth asteroid system, so that Earth impacts from cometary material are more likely than from a similar-sized asteroid

 </sup>. These large bodies drift into the near-Earth environment quite frequently in geological timescales, and in fact, the broad remains of two such bodies are present in the inner Solar System today. One of them, the Taurid Complex, is composed of debris from an ~100-km-wide comet that arrived at least 20,000 to 30,000 years ago from the centaur system of large comets and then, further disintegrated hierarchically in a short-period, Earth-crossing orbit

 </sup>. There is a reasonable probability of one or more encounters within the last 13,000 years with debris swarms from the Taurid Complex or other large fragmented comets, and such an encounter would be hemispheric in scope, lasting for only a few hours. The resulting debris field would be a mixture of dust and larger fragments, potentially equivalent to the impact of ~1000 to 10,000 destructive airbursts, such as occurred in Tunguska, Siberia in 1908

 </sup>. If such an event occurred at the YD onset, larger objects in the debris swarm could have created craters on land, struck the world’s ice sheets, and/or impacted the world’s oceans, creating severe biotic and climatic disturbances
