 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">A2</xref> that the peak concentrations of YDB spherules, meltglass, and nanodiamonds are coeval with YDB biomass-burning proxies on three continents, including charcoal (23 of 32 terrestrial sites; 4 of 4 lakes), aciniform carbon/soot (7 of 14 terrestrial sites; 0 of 1 lakes), and wildfire-related carbon spherules (22 of 32 terrestrial sites; 2 of 4 lakes). Moreover, the Bayesian-modeled ages for these sites overlap the proposed age range of the YDB event between 12,835 and 12,735 cal BP.

 </sup> as a guide, we observe that the YDB peak in biomass burning at Pilauco is consistent with subsequent post-YDB-impact environmental perturbations, but of course, does not prove by itself that an impact occurred. The Pilauco record is consistent with regional wildfire activity, indicating that anomalous YDB-age biomass burning reached into high latitudes of the Southern Hemisphere.
