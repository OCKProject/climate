<p id="Par44" class="p">To further investigate the biomass-burning history at Pilauco, we used macroscopic charcoal concentrations (&gt;125 um) from grid 10AD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4l</xref>). This analysis showed low charcoal concentrations in the upper part of unit PB-8 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4k</xref>), which pre-dates the YDB layer. Above the YDB layer, there are peak concentrations of charcoal at the base of unit PB-9, immediately following the ~12,800-year-old stratum, which is also marked by high concentrations of Pt and high-temperature impact-related spherules. Following this major peak, charcoal concentrations decline, but values remain higher than in the underlying unit PB-8. This charcoal peak is the highest in the sequence analysed and indicates an anomalously large biomass-burning episode beginning near the onset of YD climate change at ~12,800 cal BP. This biomass-burning episode appears to have contributed to significant vegetational shifts in the temperate rainforest of the Chilean Lake District
