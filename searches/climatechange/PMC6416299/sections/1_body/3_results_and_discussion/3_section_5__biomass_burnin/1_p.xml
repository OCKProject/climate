 </sup> from the quantitative analysis of micro-charcoal particles (&lt;150 um) collected in grid 14AD. Charcoal is almost absent in the interval from ~16,000 to 12,800 cal BP, indicative of low fire activity in a pre-YDB interval that was marked by a cold, relatively wet climate as determined by pollen assemblage analysis. Then, beginning at ~12,800 cal BP and continuing for several hundred years, there was a major increase in charcoal abundance that indicates an anomalous episode of biomass burning (Fig.
