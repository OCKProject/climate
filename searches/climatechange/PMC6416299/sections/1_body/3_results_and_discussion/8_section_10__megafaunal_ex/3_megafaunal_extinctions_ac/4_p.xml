 </sup>. This second technique compiles the statistically inverted gaps or time lags between consecutive dates and infers the sizes of extinct megafaunal populations based on the assumption that wider gaps between successive dates indicate smaller populations and vice versa. The disadvantage of this approach is that it uses only mean calibrated ages without considering their inherent uncertainties. Spacing analysis shows that megafaunal populations peaked at ~12,810 to 12,780 cal BP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17b</xref>) followed by a large abrupt decline in their populations beginning at or near the YD onset. Subsequently, small populations of some taxa persisted, also to decline and become extinct during the YD and early Holocene. These data closely match the results of the summed probability analysis, and overlap with the age range of 12,835 to 12,735 cal BP for the proposed YDB impact event.
