<p id="Par72" class="p">The first method, summed probability analysis, is a Bayesian analytical technique that involves calibrating megafaunal radiocarbon dates and stacking the probability ranges using the SUM algorithm in the OxCal program. Major peaks and troughs in the trends are inferred to be directly proportional to changes in megafaunal population densities

 </sup>. The advantage of this technique is that it utilizes the entire range of uncertainties for the calibrated dates. The 171 dates from Chile and Argentina are from remains of the extinct armadillo (superorder: Xenarthra; n = 11), horse (family: Equidae; n = 27), jaguar (family: Felidae; n = 6), guanaco (family: Camelidae; n = 15), mostly mastodon-like gomphothere (order: Proboscidea: n = 11), a rhinoceros-like species (suborder: Toxodonta; n = 4), saber toothed cat (genera: Smilodon; n = 5), short-face bear (family: Ursidae; n = 1), and sloth (families: mostly Mylodontidae and Megatheriidae; n = 91).
