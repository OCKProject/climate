<p id="Par71" class="p">We analyzed 171 previously reported radiocarbon dates of extinct late Pleistocene megafaunal fossils from across southern Chile and Argentina using two statistical techniques, summed probability analysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>
 </sup> and spacing analysis
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>
 </sup>. Both techniques assume that the number of radiocarbon dates increases or decreases in direct correlation with increases or decreases in size of extinct megafaunal populations. This assumption is diminished due to biases in sample collection, sample size, preservation of megafaunal remains, and variability in the accuracy and precision of the radiocarbon dates
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>
 </sup>. Despite the potential biases and inaccuracies, these two statistical methods are generally accepted as providing accurate first-order approximations of long-term changes in megafaunal population sizes
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106" class="xref">106</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122" class="xref">122</xref>
 </sup>. To avoid any bias due to the use of different calibration curves, we used original radiocarbon dates and calibrated them using the same southern hemispheric calibration curve, SHIntCal13, within the OxCal program version 4.3.2.
