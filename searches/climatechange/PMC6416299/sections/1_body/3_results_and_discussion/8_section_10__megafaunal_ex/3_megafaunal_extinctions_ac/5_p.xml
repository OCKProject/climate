 </sup>. At Pilauco, the record shows that the local extinctions coincide with the YDB layer. However, elsewhere across southern South America, there are questions whether some megafauna became extinct prior to the YD onset and whether others became extinct later in the early Holocene. In any event, the evidence at Pilauco is consistent with the hypothesis that the proposed YDB impact event contributed to the South American megafaunal extinctions.
