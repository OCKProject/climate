<p id="Par73" class="p">Our results suggest that population sizes of the extinct megafauna broadly increased after ~18 ka during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and continued to increase throughout the Antarctic Cold Reversal, even though temperatures were colder and seemingly less hospitable. Both the LGM and the Antarctic Cold Reversal were as cold or colder than the YD episode in the Northern Hemisphere (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig" class="xref">17a</xref>). Megafauna populations continued with a large, conspicuous increase until ~12,720 ± 25 cal BP, when population levels abruptly plummeted by ~60% within less than a few centuries, marking the largest drop in ~22,000 years, the limit of the record. The age of the main population peak closely matches that for South American populations reported by Surovell
