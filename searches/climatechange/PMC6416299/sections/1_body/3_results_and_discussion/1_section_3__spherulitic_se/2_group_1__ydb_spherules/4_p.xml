<p id="Par22" class="p">By plotting the SEM-EDS results of Pilauco Group 1 high-temperature Fe-rich spherules in ternary diagrams (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>), comparisons can be made to other known spherule types. Group 1 spherules are dissimilar in composition to known anthropogenic spherules that are produced primarily by coal-fired power plants, and are typically enriched in CaO, MnO, and low-temperature Na
