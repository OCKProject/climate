<p id="Par23" class="p">The ternary diagrams also indicate that Group 1 spherules do not have typical meteoritic compositions because most stony micrometeorites (96% of all micrometeorites) have MgO concentrations &gt;10 wt.%

 </sup> whereas Group 1 spherules contain no detectable MgO. In addition, Group 1 spherules are not Fe-rich micrometeorites ablated from typical Fe meteorites (~4% of meteorites) because such meteorites typically have high-Ni concentrations (averaging 9.0 wt.%, n = 76; maximum = 42.6 wt.%

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">48</xref>
 </sup>) whereas Group 1 spherules contain no detectable Ni. Pilauco’s Group 1 spherules, however, could have been ablated from a low-Ni, low-MgO impactor. In addition, Group 1 spherules are geochemically similar to spherules produced during extraterrestrial impact events that melted and ejected target rocks (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7d</xref>). Impact-related spherules from a number of confirmed sources fall into two distinct geochemical groups, one that is Fe-rich and the other Si-rich; the compositions of the YDB spherules from Pilauco only overlap with those of the former.
