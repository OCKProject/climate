<p id="Par20" class="p">Eleven SEM-EDS analyses show that Group 1 spherules are distinctive in that they contain only two oxides: FeO, averaging 93.7 wt.% (range: 100 to 86.6 wt.%) with a small percentage of SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). High formation temperatures for these spherules are indicated by the presence of FeO (melting point: ~1450 °C), SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> (melting point: ~1750 °C) and a lack of low-temperature volatiles such as Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O and K
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, which vaporize at lower temperatures. The presence of titanium in some of Pilauco’s YDB spherules is consistent with melting of titanomagnetite grains as has been previously reported

 </sup>. We infer that some Group 1 spherules formed from the melting of magnetite and titanomagnetite grains that are common in the Pilauco bulk sediments.
