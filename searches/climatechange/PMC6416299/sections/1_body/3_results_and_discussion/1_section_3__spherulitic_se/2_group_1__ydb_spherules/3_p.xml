<p id="Par21" class="p">Group 1 spherules found at Pilauco are unusual in that they exhibit considerable variation in composition and oxygen fugacity, ranging from oxygen-reduced, dendritic, Fe-rich spherules to fully oxidized Fe-oxide spherules that are found in very close proximity to one another. Four Group 1 spherules (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5a,b,e,and f</xref>), for example, were formed from highly reduced melt with a low oxygen fugacity (

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). These spherules are not composed of typical terrestrial Fe

 <sub class="sub">3</sub> (hematite; Fe:O ratio of ~70:30) or Fe
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>O
 <sub class="sub">4</sub> (magnetite; Fe:O ratio of ~72:28), but rather of FeO (wüstite; Fe:O ratio of ~78:22 to ~81:19). This composition rarely occurs under normal terrestrial conditions (e.g., from volcanism or anthropogenesis), but is common in meteorites and impact melts having much lower oxygen percentages. In addition, some non-spherulitic magnetic grains extracted from the YDB layer (552 cm) are composed of highly reduced native Fe at 97% Fe (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>) and/or reduced magnetite as FeO (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S8</xref>). Similar low-oxygen melted minerals were observed in spherules and meltglass from the YDB layer at Abu Hureyra, Syria and in meltglass from the Trinity atomic bomb test site at Alamogordo, New Mexico
