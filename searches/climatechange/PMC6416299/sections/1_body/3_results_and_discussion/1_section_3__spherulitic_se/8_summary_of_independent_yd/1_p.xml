 </sup> reported that “YDB spherules” are distributed in non-YDB layers throughout the sediment investigated, and therefore, cannot be impact-related. However, those five studies either did not conduct SEM-EDS at all or did not correctly differentiate YDB spherules from non-YDB spherulitic objects, such as volcanic spherules, framboids, and detrital grains. These disparate results, some from studies using the same sedimentary profiles, clearly emphasize the necessity of performing SEM-EDS analyses.
