<p id="Par31" class="p">Spherules in Group 5 were found only in surface, industrial-age sediment samples at a height of 651 cm with an abundance of ~440 spherules/kg (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig10" ref-type="fig" class="xref">10</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11b</xref>). Because these spherules are dendritic-textured, and hence morphologically similar to impact-related spherules of Group 1, they can only be differentiated geochemically by using SEM-EDS. The composition of these spherules closely matches known anthropogenic spherules (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7a</xref>), which are typically produced in large quantities by industrial processes, often from the burning of coal and combustion-related melting of included magnetite grains

 </sup> examined spherules from a wide variety of settings and concluded that anthropogenic spherules frequently contain 0.4–0.8 wt.% Mn, which is commonly used in the smelting of ferromanganese alloys. These values are similar to the range of 0.2 wt.% to 0.9 wt.% (average: 0.3 wt.%) for MnO in Group 5 spherules from surface samples at Pilauco.
