 </sup> to form spherules. Because this range exceeds known temperatures of erupting magma, the melted Cr-rich spherules at Pilauco almost certainly were produced by some post-eruptive, non-volcanic process. The high temperatures required to produce the Cr-rich spherules are limited to only a few processes, such as anthropogenesis, lightning, and cosmic impact

 </sup>. Anthropogenesis seems unlikely because we found no similar Cr-rich spherules at the surface in industrial-age sediments, but only at a depth of ~100 cm (height of 552 cm) in the ~12,800-year-old YDB layer. Lightning strikes are also an unlikely source because such spherules should therefore be a common occurrence in all strata, but instead, are restricted only to the 12,800-year-old YDB layer. This leaves cosmic impact as the most likely origin.
