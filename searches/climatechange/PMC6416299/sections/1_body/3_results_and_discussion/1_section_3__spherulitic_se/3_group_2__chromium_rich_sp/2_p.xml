<p id="Par25" class="p">In exploring the source of the Cr-rich spherules, we determined that all 23 sediment samples from 651 to 513 cm contain variable amounts of Cr-rich vesicular basalt fragments that are up to several cm in diameter. In one sample, the basaltic matrix is composed of aluminosilicate glass (Al: 2.3 wt.%; Si: 19.1 wt.%; Mg: 8.1 wt.%; and Ca: 8.6 wt.%) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9a</xref>). Although the bulk sediment contains no detectable Cr, those basaltic fragment examined contain numerous Cr-magnetite inclusions (Cr: 10.1 wt.%; Fe: 74.8 wt.%; Si: 5.5 wt.%; and Al: 2.6 wt.%) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" class="xref">8c,d</xref>; Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S9b</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>) that most likely crystalized as the lava cooled. These non-spherulitic inclusions contain nearly identical relative concentrations of Cr and Fe as those found in the Cr-rich spherules of Group 2 (Cr: 10.1 wt.%; Fe: 74.8 wt.%; Si: 5.5 wt.%; and Al: 2.6 wt.%) (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>) suggesting that the Cr-rich spherules formed from the melting of local Cr-rich basaltic material.
