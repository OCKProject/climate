<p id="Par30" class="p">A peak in spherulitic framboids (~80/kg) occurs at a height of 554 cm, ~2 cm higher than the high-temperature YDB spherules found at 552 cm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). These spherules are predominantly composed of hundreds of unmelted, cube-like, pyrite crystals (FeS
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) that formed slowly under anoxic conditions rather than instantaneously as with melted impact-related spherules
