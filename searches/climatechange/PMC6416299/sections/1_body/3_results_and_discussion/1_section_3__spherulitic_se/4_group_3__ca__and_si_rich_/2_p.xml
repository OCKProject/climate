<p id="Par29" class="p">Volcanic spherules like those of Group 3 are produced during eruptions of low-viscosity magmas when micro-droplets form that have the same composition as the melt
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" class="xref">54</xref>
 </sup>. Spherules from low-energy eruptions do not fall far beyond the base of volcanoes, which includes the foothills of the Andes near Pilauco. Volcanic eruptions capable of distributing tephra across wide areas are violent, explosive events driven by high gas pressures
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>, and these energetic eruptions produce tephra shards that are angular rather than rounded. For instance, the largest known eruption of the last 5 million years, the 75,000-year-old Toba-lake eruption distributed tephra up to 2500â€‰km from the caldera, but did not produce any known spherules
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">55</xref>
 </sup>. Hence, it is unlikely that volcanism can account for spherules in the YDB layer at Pilauco (Group 1) as well as those found at other YDB sites on other continents

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">46</xref>
 </sup>. Furthermore, there are no reported examples of unequivocal volcanic spherules that contain 85 wt.% to 100 wt.% FeO as found in the Group 1 YDB spherules from Pilauco and from other YDB sites. Magma can contain Fe-rich crystals that can crystallize from the melt slowly over time, but there is no known mechanism by which YDB-like spherules containing &gt;85 wt.% FeO can form from erupting magma composed of no more than ~13 wt.% Fe.
