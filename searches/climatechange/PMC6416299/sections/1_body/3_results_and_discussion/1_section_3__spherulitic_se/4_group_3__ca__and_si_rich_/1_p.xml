<p id="Par28" class="p">A third group of spherules are Ca- and Si-rich relative to Group 1 and 2 spherules and are randomly distributed at low concentrations (0 to ~10 spherules/kg) in the five sedimentary samples analyzed from Pilauco (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" class="xref">9a,b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S11a</xref>). None were found in the YDB layer. These spherules contain a range of ~61 to 17 wt.% SiO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> along with highly variable concentrations of Na
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>O, MgO, SO
 <sub class="sub">3</sub>, and CaO (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S7</xref>). These compositions closely match those of the vesicular basalt fragments found in Pilauco sequences (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5a</xref>), suggesting they are of volcanic origin.
