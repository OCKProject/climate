<p id="Par51" class="p">At the YDB layer (PB-8/PB-9 boundary), the percentage of non-arboreal vegetation increased sharply from ~45% to ~85% of pollen (grid 14AD; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>), representing the largest change exhibited in the pollen record from Pilauco. Many of the previously dominant taxa characteristic of the North Patagonian forest disappeared or decreased from pre-YDB levels (lower Shannon index and species richness) with a remarkable shift in vegetation turnover index from 0 to 0.4 (Fig.
