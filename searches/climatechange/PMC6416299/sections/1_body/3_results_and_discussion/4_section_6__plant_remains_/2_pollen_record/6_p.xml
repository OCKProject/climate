<p id="Par54" class="p">The plant and charcoal records from Pilauco are complex, but crucial for understanding regional climate change, and so, we summarize our findings here. Although most investigations in the Lake District, Chiloe Island, and Pilauco show variability among sites before, during, and after the YD Chronozone, essentially the same forest/climate succession and environmental disruption is evident among all the records across the YD boundary (e.g. Moreno
