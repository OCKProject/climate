 </sup> provide a solid context for the climatic interpretation of this major shift in vegetation. Despite pollen concentrations that decrease dramatically after the YDB (10× from 68,811 to 6,372 grains/cc), pollen is sufficiently abundant and diverse in the post-YDB sequence for the interpretation of broad environmental trends, especially when evaluated in the context of previous regional records. At the YD onset, drier conditions are indicated by the disappearance of aquatic ferns (
 <italic class="italic">Isoetes</italic> sp.; grids 10AD and 14AD), following their persistent presence throughout the pre-YDB sequence. These changes were also accompanied by increased biomass burning fostered by the onset of a marked seasonality of rainfall and warmer conditions. Furthermore, beginning at the YDB layer the vegetation records show a distinct upward increase (from 5 to 20%) of pioneering/colonizing taxa indicative of more disturbed open habitats (Fig.

 </sup>. These taxa appear to have colonized the area in response to the abrupt onset of alternating seasonal drying and precipitation (humidity) that also promoted an increase in biomass burning. All of these factors indicate that the post-YDB vegetation at Pilauco is closely affiliated with the more northern Valdivian rainforest that favors seasonally drier and warmer conditions. As such, the vegetation history at Pilauco records a sudden shift at the YDB from cooler, wetter conditions characteristic of the North Patagonian forest to seasonally drier and warmer conditions of the Valdivian rainforest. Coinciding with the termination of the Antarctic Cold Reversal, this shift in vegetation at the YDB continued for at least 100 years, suggesting persistent post-YDB climate change and a disturbed landscape.
