<p id="Par46" class="p">We recovered and analysed ~4,800 carpological (reproductive) structures (e.g., fruits, seeds, and capsules) from grid 8AD between 572 and 524 cm, allowing us to infer the local pre- and post-YD vegetational history (Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S10</xref>). Samples from unit PB-8 below the YDB layer contain consistently abundant carpological structures with up to 573 specimens per sample (mean 370 ± 156 SD). Leaf cuticles of evergreen tree species are common below the YDB, as represented by two pioneering trees from the Proteaceae family (

 <italic class="italic">Embothrium coccineum</italic>) and 
 <italic class="italic">Amomyrtus meli</italic>, a tree from the Myrtaceae family that requires wet soil for proper growth. Additionally, other pioneering evergreen tree species such as
