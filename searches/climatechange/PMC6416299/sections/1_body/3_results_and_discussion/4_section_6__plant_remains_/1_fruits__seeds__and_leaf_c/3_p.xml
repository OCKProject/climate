<p id="Par48" class="p">To investigate whether the decline in abundance of carpological structures reflects a decline in the local vegetation or whether the absence of plant remains is an artifact of the sampling methodology, we used a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) regression (see Methods). Results from the GLM analysis indicate that the major, abrupt drop in seed abundance between units PB-8 and PB-9 is statistically significant, and hence, is unlikely to have resulted from taphonomic factors such as variable transport, preservation, deposition, and/or sampling protocol
