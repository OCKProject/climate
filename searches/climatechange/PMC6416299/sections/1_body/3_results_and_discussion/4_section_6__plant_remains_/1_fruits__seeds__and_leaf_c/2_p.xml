<p id="Par47" class="p">The seeds and cuticles from nearly all of these pre-YDB plants essentially disappear from the record after the sharply defined PB-8/PB-9 boundary (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig" class="xref">13</xref>), representing both a major decrease in abundance and diversity of plant materials and a pronounced shift in the taxonomic composition of plant assemblages. Carpological structures are ~7× less abundant above the YDB layer and remain low throughout unit PB-9, ranging from 0 to 93 specimens per sample (mean 30 ± 34 SD).
