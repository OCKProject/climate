<p id="Par38" class="p">Are the enrichments volcanic in origin, especially since Andean basalt at Pilauco already contains high concentrations of Pt? This explanation is unlikely, however, because the Pt/Pd and Au/Pt ratios in the YDB layer are substantially different from those in the layers above and below it. This most likely indicates that the enrichment peaks are not concentrations of volcanic PGEs, but rather, resulted from the influx of Pt, Pd, and Au from some other source than the local Andean volcanoes.</p>
