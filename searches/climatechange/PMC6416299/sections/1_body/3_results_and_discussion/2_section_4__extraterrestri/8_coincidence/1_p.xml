<p id="Par41" class="p">Is the co-occurrence of Pt, Pd, and Au simply coincidental? If so, peaks in Pt and magnetic spherules should co-occur at random in non-YDB layers. However, no such synchronous, co-occurrence has ever been found outside of the YDB layer at Pilauco or at any other YDB site worldwide or in any other non-YDB stratigraphic layer.</p>
