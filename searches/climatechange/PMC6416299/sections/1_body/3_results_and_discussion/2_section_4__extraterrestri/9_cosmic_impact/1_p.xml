<p id="Par42" class="p">Finally, the PGE enrichment could have resulted from the influx of nonlocal, impact-related Pt, Pd, and Au, all of which are enriched above local background levels. This is the only explanation consistent with the evidence from known cosmic impact sites and is favored for the Pilauco YDB layer. Although this evidence is not conclusive of a YDB impact event, the age for the YDB layer at Pilauco is coeval with ages for those layers found on other continents, supporting the YDB cosmic impact hypothesis.</p>
