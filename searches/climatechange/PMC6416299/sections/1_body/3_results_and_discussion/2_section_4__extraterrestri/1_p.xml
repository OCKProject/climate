These authors attributed a decades-long episode of Pt deposition to a cosmic impact event that resulted in “multiple injections of Pt-rich dust into the stratosphere

Since that initial discovery of a YDB Pt peak in Greenland, several more investigations have found elevated concentrations of Pt, and other Pt-group elements (PGEs), and high-temperature PGE-rich spherules, marking the YD onset within 28 widely separated sediment sequences across North America, Europe, and Asia
