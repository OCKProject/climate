<p id="Par91" class="p">To determine the composition of spherules from Pilauco, we used scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and ternary geochemical analyses to compare the YDB spherules from Pilauco to other known types of spherules. David Kimbel in the US extracted the magnetic fractions and Jennifer Zeldin in the US mounted candidate YDB spherules for SEM analyses. M.A.L. and V.A. performed the SEM-EDS analyses using a JEOL JSM 6010PLUS/LA at Elizabeth City State University and a Hitachi S3200N variable pressure scanning electron microscope (VPSEM) at North Carolina State University. All SEM imagery was acquired at a resolution of 2560 × 1920 pixels. Images were uniformly post-processed for contrast and brightness, if necessary, using Adobe Photoshop CC2014.</p>
