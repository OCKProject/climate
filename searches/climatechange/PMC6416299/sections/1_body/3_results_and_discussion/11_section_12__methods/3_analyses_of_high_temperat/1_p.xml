<p id="Par90" class="p">Twenty-three bulk sediment samples (~1 kg each) from grid 8AD were examined across a 138-cm-thick profile that ranged in height from 651 cm at the surface to 513 cm at its deepest point. Continuous samples were taken between 572 and 524 cm, with one additional discontinuous sample each taken at the top and bottom of the section. Sample thicknesses averaged ~3 cm along the sediment profile. From 552 to 548 cm, samples were 1-cm thick. The four samples collected below and above these were 2-cm thick, and samples at the top and bottom of the profile were 4-cm thick. Samples were collected by M.P. and Daniel Fritte.</p>
