<p id="Par96" class="p">To investigate the biomass-burning history of the Pilauco section, we performed macroscopic charcoal analysis on samples from a 38-cm-long profile including the PB-8/PB-9 boundary in grid 10AD, located on the west wall of the site. We analyzed 2 cm
 <sup class="sup">3</sup> of sediment taken at contiguous 1-cm intervals along the complete section. The samples were sieved using the methods outlined by Whitlock and Larsen
