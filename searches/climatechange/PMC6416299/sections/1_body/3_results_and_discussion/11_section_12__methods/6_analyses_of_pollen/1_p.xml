 </sup>. Pollen samples were analyzed by co-authors, A.M.A. and A.M-C. at the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia. Chemical treatment included deflocculation with 10% KOH, sieving to remove large debris (150 μm), silicate dissolution with 40% hydrofluoric acid (HF), acetolysis with 10% KOH, and concentrated HF and acetolysis. The concentrates were mounted in glycerin and analyzed at 400× and 1000× with a Zeiss microscope. Taxonomical determinations were made based on published descriptions
