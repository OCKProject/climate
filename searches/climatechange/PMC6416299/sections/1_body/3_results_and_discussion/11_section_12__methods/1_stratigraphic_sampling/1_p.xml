<p id="Par88" class="p">A 280-cm-long, 5-cm-wide column was collected from grid 14AD that included units PB-7, PB-8, and PB-9. Later, in 2014, a 34-cm-wide column was collected from grid 10AC to develop a detailed stratigraphic sequence across the PB-8/PB-9 boundary. Grain-size analyses by wet sieving and loss-on-ignition (LOI) were performed at 1-cm intervals along both stratigraphic columns to quantify proportions of gravel, sand, mud, and organic fractions. Sedimentological sampling and analyses were performed at the Universidad Austral de Chile, Valdivia, by co-author M.P. with the assistance of Javiera Barria and Daniel Fritte. Subsequently, co-author M.P.L. developed the stratigraphic profile.</p>
