<p id="Par93" class="p">The same 138-cm-thick profile examined for the presence of impact spherules in grid 8AD was also investigated for plant remains (fruits, seeds, capsules, cuticles). Sediment samples were collected and analyzed by M.P., Daniel Fritte, and Javiera Barria. The sediment samples were wet sieved through a series of sieves (2 mm to 63 µm) for the separation of gravel, sand, and mud. Next, the fractions were oven-dried at 60 °C, dry weighed, and stored in plastic bags for further examination. The fractions from each sample were examined under a stereomicroscope at 10 × to 40 × magnification for the picking and sorting of reproductive structures (i.e., seeds, fruits and capsules; hereinafter referred to as seeds) and leaf cuticles. Plant remains were analyzed by G.A. at the Universidad Austral de Chile, in Valdivia.</p>
