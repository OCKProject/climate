<p id="Par94" class="p">Numerical analyses were performed only on the seed data because of the high fragmentation of cuticle remains and uncertainty in knowing the number of individual leaves from which the cuticle fragments were derived. We tested whether variation of our count response variable (number of seeds) for units PB-8 and PB-9 was affected by different sample sizes (thickness and/or total weight of the sample). To do so, we fitted a Poisson GLM regression, in which the dependent variable is allowed to have a non-normal distribution. This regression holds that any observed response is a linear sum of multiple underlying individual responses. Because we detected over-dispersion (greater than expected variance from the mean), a correction of the standard errors was performed using a quasi-GLM model specifying the mean and variance relationship (i.e., variance given by φ × μ, where μ is the mean and φ the dispersion parameter), following the method of Zuur

 </sup>. Finally, we fitted a negative binomial GLM and compared the two approaches by using the log-likelihoods of the negative binomial regression model and a Poisson regression model using the odTest function of the ‘pscl’ package in R. All analyses were conducted in R
