<p id="Par89" class="p">A total of 36 AMS radiocarbon dates were obtained for this study from bulk sediment, seeds, charcoal, wood, plant remains, bone, teeth, and coprolites (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref>). Samples were acquired in Chile by M.P. with the assistance of Daniel Fritte. Nine radiocarbon dates are from Pino

 </sup> and 27 others were obtained for this study. Twelve dates were measured by the NSF-Arizona AMS facility, University of Arizona and 24 are from the W. M. Keck Carbon Cycle Accelerator Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, University of California, Irvine. Samples for radiocarbon dating were collected from excavation grids 6E, 7AC, 7 G, E9, 10AD, 11 H, 12 F, 14AD, 15AC, and 15AD (Supplementary Figs 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>–
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). Twenty AMS radiocarbon dates were outside the interval of interest, and the remaining sixteen were used to develop an age-height model (see Methods; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). These dates were calibrated within the OxCal program 4.3.2

 </sup>, using the Southern Hemispheric calibration curve, SHIntCal13. Uncertainties were calculated at confidence intervals (CI) of 68% and 95%. The layer dating to ~12,800 cal BP was identified in grid 8AD at a height of ~550 cm above the site datum (elevation, not depth). Because stratigraphic heights varied by centimeters to decimeters in other grids, the YDB layer in all grids is correlated and normalized to 550 cm in grid 8AD, allowing stratigraphic and chronologic comparisons among the various proxies measured in the different grids.
