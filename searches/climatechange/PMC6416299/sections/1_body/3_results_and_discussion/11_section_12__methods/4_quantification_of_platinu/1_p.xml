 </sup>. Sediment samples of approximately 50 grams each were collected by M.P. and Javiera Barria and then sent for analysis by Activation Laboratories (ActLabs), Canada using their “1C-Research” package. The package includes fire-assay (FA) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to measure elemental concentrations of Pt, Pd, and Au. Prior to analysis, each sample was mixed with fire assay fluxes (borax, soda ash, silica, litharge) and silver (Ag) was added as a collector. The mixture was placed in a crucible and preheated to 850 °C, intermediately heated at 950 °C, and finished at 1060 °C for a total of 60 minutes. After the crucibles were removed from the assay furnace, the molten slag was poured into a mold leaving a lead button. The lead button was then preheated to 950 °C to recover the Ag (doré bead) mixed with the extracted Au, Pt and Pd. The Ag doré bead was digested in hot (95 °C) HNO
 <sub class="sub">3 + </sub>HCl with a special complexing agent to prevent the Au, Pd, and Pt from adsorbing onto the test tube. After cooling for 2 hours, the sample solution was analyzed for Au, Pt, and Pd using a Perkin Elmer Sciex ELAN 9000 ICP-MS. On each tray of 42 samples there were 2 method blanks, 3 sample duplicates, and 2 certified reference materials. The ICP-MS was recalibrated every 45 samples. Smaller sample splits were used for high-chromium and sulfide samples. Measurements are reported in parts per billion (ppb) with a lower limit of detection for Pt of 0.1 ppb. All control testing indicated that the analyses were accurate and replicable.
