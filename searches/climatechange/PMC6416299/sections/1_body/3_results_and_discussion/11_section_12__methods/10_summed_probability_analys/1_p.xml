 </sup> that involves calibrating megafaunal radiocarbon dates and stacking the probability ranges using the SUM algorithm in OxCal v. 4.3.2. Major peaks and troughs are inferred to represent changing megafaunal population densities, i.e., greater numbers of dates are inferred to reflect larger populations, with fewer dates indicating smaller populations
