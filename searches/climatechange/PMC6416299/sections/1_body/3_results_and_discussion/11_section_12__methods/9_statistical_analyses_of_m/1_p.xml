<p id="Par98" class="p">Spacing analysis was used to investigate the gaps or time lags between consecutive calibrated radiocarbon dates. This technique assumes that mean spacings between calibrated ages are inversely proportional to the size of extinct megafaunal populations (i.e., smaller intervals mean larger populations). To avoid inaccuracies introduced by the use of multiple calibration curves, we did not use calibrated dates from the original studies. Instead, co-author A.W. recalibrated all original radiocarbon dates with the OxCal program, version 4.3.2

 </sup>, using SHCal13, the radiocarbon calibration curve for the Southern Hemisphere. After inverting the age intervals to identify the point at which the megafaunal populations began to decrease before full extinction, we used linear regression with breakpoints, estimated through lowess smoothing. The sources of 171 radiocarbon dates are, n = 6 this study; n = 24 from Araújo

 </sup>. Duplicates were eliminated. The dates were ranked in quality from 11 to 17 by the original authors based on multiple factors (e.g., the kind of material dated, the association of the dated material with the taxon or event that was being dated, and the method of dating (AMS or standard)). Dates lower than the rank of 11 were excluded from this study because, as suggested by Barnosky and Lindsey
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118" class="xref">118</xref>
 </sup>, lower-ranked dates are considered to be insufficiently robust. Megafaunal remains were excavated and analyzed under the supervision of M.P. at the Pilauco Lab and at the Universidad Austral de Chile in Valdivia.
