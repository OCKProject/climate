<p id="Par55" class="p">The high-resolution climatic record at Pilauco allows us to test the correlation of local climate at ~12,800â€‰cal BP with similar changes across a much wider area. The result is a novel synthesis showing the onset of abrupt, coeval, pan-hemispheric climatic change. This is suggestive, but not conclusive of causation by a cosmic impact event at the YD onset, which may be represented by the recently discovered Hiawatha Crater in Greenland
