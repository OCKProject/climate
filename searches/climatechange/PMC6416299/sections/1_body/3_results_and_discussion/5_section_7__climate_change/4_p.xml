 </sup> that injected massive quantities of meltwater and ice into the adjacent Arctic and North Atlantic Oceans, thus reducing sea surface salinities and expanding sea-ice across the Arctic and high latitudes of the North Atlantic. This, in turn, strongly reduced North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation and curtailed production of North Atlantic Intermediate Waters, further strengthening cooling and sea-ice expansion in the Northern Hemisphere. This major change in circulation in the Northern Hemisphere helped to stimulate Antarctic deep-water production in the Southern Hemisphere and its northward expansion in the world’s oceans. The abrupt YD cooling episode in the Northern Hemisphere, in turn, prompted changes in global atmospheric telecommunication represented by a sequence of southward shifts in the zonal wind systems in response to the changes in sea-surface temperature gradients.
