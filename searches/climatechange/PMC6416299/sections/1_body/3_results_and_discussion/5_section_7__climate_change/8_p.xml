<p id="Par62" class="p">The boundary between the warm Bølling-Allerød climatic episode (14,500 to 12,800 cal BP) and the subsequent cold YD episode in the Northern Hemisphere precisely correlates with anti-phased climate change in the Southern Hemisphere. This boundary in the Southern Hemisphere, as well documented at Pilauco, represents a useful isochronous datum for intercontinental correlation and dating of deglacial sequences

 </sup>. The YDB datum layer, regardless of its origin, allows precise interhemispheric correlation of climate change at ~12,800 cal BP.
