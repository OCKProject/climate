<p id="Par61" class="p">The evidence suggests that a seemingly enigmatic chain of interconnected oceanic and atmospheric circulation changes caused the YD climatic episode to be expressed simultaneously in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. These changes were marked by anomalous timing and by the character and magnitude of changes in continental meltwater plumbing, accompanied by major shifts in atmospheric and oceanic circulation. We posit that the YDB cosmic impact event, possibly resulting in the Hiawatha Crater, triggered these processes and that they appear less enigmatic in the context of a cosmic impact triggering mechanism.</p>
