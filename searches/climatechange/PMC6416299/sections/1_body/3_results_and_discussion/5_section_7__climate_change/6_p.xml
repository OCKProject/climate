 </sup>, possibly at ~12,800 cal BP. This warming trend is just one of multiple extreme characteristics marking the YD episode. It is possible that the warming at high southern latitudes, resulting from the southward shift of the southern westerly winds and the South Pacific Tropical High, contributed to the major increase in heat transfer necessary to significantly warm the deep Southern Ocean, which in turn, would have reduced sea ice extent, as well as stimulated ocean turnover and production of deep waters. The loci of Antarctic deep water production likely shifted to the north in the warmer, ice-free, open Southern Ocean, where the production of warmer deep waters would have been dominated by open-ocean convection processes

 </sup>. This shift would have enhanced heat transfer to the deep Southern Ocean, especially in absence of North Atlantic Deep Water formation, and may help explain the major, highly unusual rapid increase in mean ocean water temperatures for 700 years during the early and middle YD
