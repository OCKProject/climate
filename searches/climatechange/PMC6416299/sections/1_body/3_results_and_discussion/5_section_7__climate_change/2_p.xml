 </sup>. This change is associated with the termination of the Antarctic Cold Reversal episode, anti-phased with the shift in the Northern Hemisphere from the warm Bølling-Allerød to the colder YD. The Pilauco record shows that this climate shift occurred very rapidly within just a few years or less, based on sedimentary deposition rates. It appears that the abrupt changes in southern Chilean vegetation (cool/wet North Patagonia forest to warmer/drier Valdivian rainforest), marking the YD onset and the termination of the Antarctic Cold Reversal, were caused by the abrupt southward shift of the southern westerly wind belt towards the Southern Ocean and Antarctica
