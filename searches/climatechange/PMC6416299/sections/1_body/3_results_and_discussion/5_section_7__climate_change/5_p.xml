<p id="Par59" class="p">The Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) is a belt of low pressure which circles the Earth, generally where the trade winds of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres come together near the equator. During climatic transitions of the late Quaternary, tight coupling is known to have existed between the southern margin of the ITCZ and the southern westerly winds

 </sup>. At the onset of the YD, the ITCZ was pushed southwards farther into the Southern Hemisphere, and this, in turn, resulted in extreme southward displacement of the southern westerlies

 </sup>, as reflected in southern Chilean sequences, including Pilauco. This is an important process, because changes in the latitudinal position and strength of the southern westerlies strongly affect ocean circulation in the Southern Hemisphere and strengthen warming south of 35Â°S

 </sup>, including the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. At the onset of the YD, this was reflected by a reduction in sea ice extent and increased wind-driven upwelling and ocean overturning
