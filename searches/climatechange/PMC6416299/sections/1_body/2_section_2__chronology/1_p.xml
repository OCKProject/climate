 </sup>. This age-height model allows us to infer the following Bayesian age spans and deposition rates for the sedimentary profile in grid 8AD. PB-6: this unit contains wood fragments with a youngest calibrated radiocarbon age of 17,233 ± 103 cal yr BP (Supplementary Tables 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Bayesian analysis indicates the boundary of PB-6 (~325 cm) dates to ~16,260 ± 260 cal yr BP with a terminal deposition rate of 19 yr cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the slowest rate observed in the profile. PB-7: the age span of this unit is ~16,260 ± 260 (at ~325 cm) to 15,200 ± 240 cal yr BP (405 cm) with an average deposition rate of 13 yr cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. PB-8: the age span of this unit is 15,200 ± 240 cal yr BP (405 cm) to 12,770 ± 160 cal yr BP (550 cm, representing the YDB layer) for an average deposition rate of ~17 yr cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>. The sedimentation rate across the PB-8/PB-9 boundary is ~5 cm in ~2.5 years, a very rapid rate of ~0.5 yr cm
 <sup class="sup">−1</sup>, the fastest observed in the sequence. This unit represents a continuous record that allows high-resolution investigations such as ours. PB-9: this unit ranges in age from ~12,770 ± 160 (550 cm) to 10,250 ± 150 (640 cm) with an average deposition rate of ~28 yr cm
