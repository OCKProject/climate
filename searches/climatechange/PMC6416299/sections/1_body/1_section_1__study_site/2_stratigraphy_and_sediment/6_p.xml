<p id="Par16" class="p">After the black mat’s discovery at Pilauco, several stratigraphic sections on the west wall of the excavations were sampled for different environmental and potential impact-related proxies. Grid 8AD samples were examined for seeds, magnetic spherules, and Pt concentrations (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref>). Samples from grid 10AD were examined for charcoal and pollen concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), and grid 14AD was sampled for radiocarbon dating and

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). All grids were examined for megafaunal remains, wood fragments, and lithic artifacts
