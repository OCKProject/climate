 </sup> summarized previous studies (their TableÂ 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">A2</xref>) showing that 24 of 27 YDB sites with black mats also display peaks in YDB proxies (e.g., magnetic spherules, carbon spherules, high-temperature meltglass, and/or nanodiamonds). The authors of these studies argued that the presence of these YDB proxies suggests, but is not conclusive of a relationship among the YDB impact event, an intense episode of biomass burning, and the 12,800-year-old black mat.
