 </sup> concluded that these mats are complex pedological features derived from two major processes: first, from deposition of organic-rich material, e.g., as in wetlands (29 of the 70 sites)

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42" class="xref">42</xref>

 </sup>). The classic black mat in its “type” area (the Upper San Pedro Valley of Arizona, including the Clovis site at Murray Springs) is a wetland deposit resulting from wetter conditions that occurred at and after the YD onset

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">40</xref>–
