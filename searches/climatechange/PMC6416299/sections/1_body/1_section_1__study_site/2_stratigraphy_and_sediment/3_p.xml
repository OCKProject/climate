<p id="Par13" class="p">The basal unit of the Pilauco stratigraphic sequence (PB-6) is an unconsolidated sedimentary bed containing abundant well-rounded pebbles and boulders. (For further details on Pilauco sedimentary stratigraphy, see Supplementary Information,

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S3</xref>). The next higher unit (PB-7) is an organic-rich sand composed of isolated, poorly sorted colluvial volcanoclastics that contain most of the extinct megafauna remains and lithic artifacts. Unit PB-8 is composed of organic-rich mudstone separated by thin, muddy laminae, similar to unit PB-7, although it contains fewer mammal fossils and lithic artifacts than the unit PB-7 below it. Unit PB-8 also contains the youngest horse coprolite found at the site

 </sup>. At Pilauco, the key stratigraphic feature is the PB-8/PB-9 boundary that marks major environmental and sedimentological changes, and is inferred from radiocarbon dating to be the YDB layer. Immediately above the YDB in unit PB-9 there is a large accumulation of wood fragments, frequently found along an undulating contact that defines a sharp lithological change (Supplementary Figs

 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S5</xref>). Overall, unit PB-9 is a relatively fine-grained, black, organic-rich peat.
