<p id="Par9" class="p">It is important to note that the main objective of this contribution is to test the YDB hypothesis and to document and discuss the wide range of evidence found within the Pilauco sedimentary section in southern Chile (FigsÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>). In this study, we sought to determine whether the evidence at Pilauco is consistent or inconsistent with the YDB impact hypothesis and to explore the potential consequences of the proposed impact event.
