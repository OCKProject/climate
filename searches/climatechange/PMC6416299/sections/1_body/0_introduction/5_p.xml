 </sup> conclude that the potential age range of the impact event spans the YD onset, although the crater is as yet undated. The potential for a YDB age is based on several lines of evidence: (1) Post-YDB annual ice layers are present from the Younger Dryas (12,800 to 11,700 cal BP) through the Holocene (11,700 cal BP to modern times), but undisturbed pre-YDB ice layers are missing. However, four widely distributed, distinctive, radar-reflecting, pre-YDB ice layers, including the youngest that spans the Bølling-Allerød (14,700 to 12,800 cal BP), are missing within the crater and within 100 km around it, consistent with having been disrupted by the impact event. (2) There is evidence of hydrothermal activity within the crater beneath the overlying 930-meter-thick ice sheet, as would be expected from residual heat generated by a young impact. If such activity had been caused by an impact event, it would be short-lived because the continuing melting of ice cover over the crater would efficiently dissipate the heat. Therefore, ongoing hydrothermal activity is consistent with a very young age for the crater. (3) The subglacial crater rim and basin appear relatively fresh and minimally eroded, consistent with a young crater

 </sup>. If the crater were very old, the rim is expected to be much more subdued, due to the erosive effects of glacial ice movements, as is apparent with many once-subglacial Canadian crater rims that were flattened by movement of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. (4) Kjaer

 </sup> conclude that such a massive impact event “very likely had significant environmental consequences in the Northern Hemisphere and possibly globally.” If so, this impact event may have triggered climate change in southern Chile, which we explore in this contribution.
