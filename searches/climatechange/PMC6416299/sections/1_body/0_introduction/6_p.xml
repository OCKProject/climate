<p id="Par7" class="p">The Chilean Council of National Monuments has protected the unique Pilauco site as an important paleontological and archaeological resource because of its rich and abundant assemblage of extinct South American Pleistocene mammals and cultural remains. Prior descriptions of the stratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronology of this well-exposed sedimentary sequence

 </sup>. In this study, we conducted time series material analyses across the sedimentary sequence to determine changes in concentrations of Pt, palladium (Pd), high-temperature magnetic spherules, charcoal, plant macrofossils, pollen, and dung fungal spores (

Also, the Pilauco stratigraphic sequence has provided an unprecedented opportunity to compare the regional megafaunal extinctions at high resolution with similar coeval extinctions in the Northern Hemisphere. We have also undertaken quantitative pollen and seed analyses across the boundary layer for paleoclimatic and paleo-environmental assessments and for comparison with YD climatic change as determined from sequences in the Northern Hemisphere.
