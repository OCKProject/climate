 </sup>, the YDB impact hypothesis is still controversial a decade later because a number of independent studies have raised questions about the proposed YDB impact event. (1) The authors of several studies
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup> have argued that dating accuracy and precision are insufficient to determine whether YDB proxies are coeval across the many sites. (2) Five of 13 independent studies were unable to confirm the presence of peaks in YDB magnetic spherules (see Supplementary Information, “Previously reported evidence of YDB magnetic spherules” for details). (3) Three studies

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>
 </sup> noted that sediment sampling at YDB sites is typically discontinuous, except at and around the YDB layer, where sampling spanned at most a few thousand years, making it difficult to know whether the “impact assemblage” of indicators is unique to the YDB (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The same concern applies to this study in which we sampled continuously at high resolution for ~300 years across the YDB layer and sporadically before and after, totalling ~17,000 years. (4) In one study

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>
 </sup>, it was argued that the proposed YDB impact mechanism of a fragmented comet is so rare as to be statistically implausible. (5) Several investigators

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup> proposed that the rate and timing of megafaunal extinctions were not simultaneous but varied across the continents, with a large percentage of them occurring prior to the YDB. (6) Another study
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup> concluded that a major peak in wildfire activity preceded the YD onset by several hundred years and did not correlate with the YD onset. (7) It was argued in several studies
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" class="xref">15</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" class="xref">18</xref>
 </sup> that individual “impact indicators” are also produced by non-impact processes, thus not requiring an impact. Finally, (8) another study

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>
 </sup> argued that YD climate change had little effect on people and their animal prey across the central portion of the US. For a limited number of selected contributions relevant to this hypothesis, see Supplementary Table
