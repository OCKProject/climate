 </sup> of a giant, 31-km-wide, possible YDB-aged impact crater under the Hiawatha Glacier in northwestern Greenland, calculated to have been produced by a 1.5-km-wide impactor. This is the 25th largest known terrestrial crater, the largest in the last ~5 million years (52-km-wide Kara-Kul crater in Tajikistan), and the second largest in the last ~35.3 million years (40-km-wide Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, USA). Impact proxies include high-temperature spherules, meltglass, amorphous carbon, and elevated concentrations of Ni, Co, Cr, PGEs (e.g., Pt, Ir, and Os), and Au
