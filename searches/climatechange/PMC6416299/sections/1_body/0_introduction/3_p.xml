 </sup> of the YDB impact hypothesis concede that individual proxies might have formed through alternative processes, but argue that coeval abundance peaks for the

 </sup> (~65.5 million years ago), forming a global datum layer. Similarly, the 780,000-year-old Australasian impact event dispersed small amounts of microscopic spherules and impact glass across ~30% of the planet’s surface, forming the largest known impact strewnfield

 </sup>, for which no physical crater has been found. As with the K-T and Australasian impact events, the YDB layer contains a suite of impact proxies within a datum layer that can also be used for global correlation and dating. Impact proponents argue that the YDB datum layer is precisely equivalent in age to the onset of the YD cooling episode recorded in the Greenland ice sheet and in many other stratigraphic sections in the Northern Hemisphere
