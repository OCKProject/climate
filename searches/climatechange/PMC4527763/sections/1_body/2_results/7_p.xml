<p class="p">Overall this first regression had quite low explanatory power, with a McFadden R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of 0.012. However, this score is different from an R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> in standard regression and is a relative measure that is comparable only to other models estimated on the same data set. Comparing the R
 <sup class="sup">2</sup> of this model with the other two models, it is apparent that the explanatory power of models 2 and 3 is an order of magnitude better. This implies that religious affiliation had some explanatory power in terms of climate change beliefs, but that variables related to socio-demographics and attitudes collectively had much more explanatory power.
