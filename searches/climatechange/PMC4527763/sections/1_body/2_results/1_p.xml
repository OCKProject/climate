<p class="p">The results on the association between religious affiliation and segment membership are presented in 
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.t002" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 2</xref>. The results suggest that the Christian non-literal denominations are likely to most closely represent the overall sample, though they do have a slightly smaller proportion in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> segment. The Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion group (43.8%) and Buddhists (45.7%) have a much higher percentage of people located in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments than the sample overall (33.3%). Further, Atheist/Agnostic/No Religion (16.3%) and Buddhists (2.9%) have a lower percentage of people located in the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments than the sample overall (20.6%). The respondents who indicate affiliation with Christian denominations that have a literal interpretation of scripture have a smaller proportion of people located in the 
 <italic class="italic">Alarmed</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Concerned</italic> segments (19.6%). The Christian literalists are also more likely to have a much higher percentage of people located in the 
 <italic class="italic">Doubtful</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Dismissive</italic> segments (30.2%) than the sample overall.
