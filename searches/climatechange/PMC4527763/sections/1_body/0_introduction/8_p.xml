<p class="p">Hence, this line of research effectively concluded that the association between a Christian perspective and dominion over nature was spurious [

One consistent result from US studies is in accord with White’s thesis, and shows that those adhering more closely to a literal biblical viewpoint are less likely to support pro-environmental action [

 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>]. In addition, Guth et al. [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] showed that US “secularists” generally support environmental policy, while Catholics are in the middle ground between the above extremes. Taken together, these results support the contention that a more appropriate conclusion is that religious factors are indirectly causal rather than spurious. Furthermore, a key variable emerging from the literature on Christian belief was literal interpretation of the bible. The large number of Christians attached to evangelical churches in the US, likely to hold more literal views, is an important issue in overall public opinion. Australia has a smaller proportion of Christians who identify as evangelicals. Nevertheless, given the differences observed in the US, it did seem worthwhile to include a focus in our work on the distinction in climate change attitudes and behavior between literal and non-literal Christians in Australia.
