<p class="p">The literature also reveals that there are important differences between countries in the influence that religious affiliation has on ways of looking at climate change issues [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. This fact points to a need to consider the religious issues within a particular country context. There has been little attention given to these issues in Australia, and consequently one objective of the current paper is to examine how religious make-up affects attitudes and behavior in relation to climate change and climate change policy. Moreover, there are important features of the Australian situation that suggest that it is a country worthy of study. Dramatic societal change will be required there to achieve substantial carbon emission reductions. Although it is only a moderate carbon emitter in aggregate terms (ranked 17
 <sup class="sup">th</sup> in the world), in per capita terms it is the worldâ€™s second highest emitter [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref009" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>]. Also it is particularly dependent on the coal economy and will require considerable structural change to progress towards a low-carbon economy. These considerations mean that in future Australia could be an indicator of global progress on combating climate change.
