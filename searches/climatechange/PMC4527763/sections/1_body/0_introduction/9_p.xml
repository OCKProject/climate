<p class="p">More recently Truelove and Joireman [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>], developed two scales: a Christian orthodoxy scale, and a biblical literal scale. Their thesis was that there could be either a “social-altruistic” effect that would have Christians supportive of environmental policy, or a “lower-knowledge-of-the-biosphere” effect that would produce the reverse effect. Then, from survey results, they discovered that Christian orthodoxy and biblical literalism were inversely associated with all measures of environmental behavior, and that the lower-knowledge-of-the-biosphere effect was dominant. Similarly, the impact of respondents’ scientific knowledge has also been shown to be critical in other studies in Germany [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref021" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">21</xref>], Sweden [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">22</xref>] and Britain [
 <xref rid="pone.0134868.ref023" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">23</xref>]. Thus a need to take into account further mediating variables, altruism and knowledge, when assessing the relationship between religion and attitudes towards the environment has been suggested by these studies.
