<p class="p">We used a continental (South America) calibration area for the ENMs, which means that the climatic niche of each species was projected in the South American bioclimatic envelope. In the present study, the patterns of species geographic distribution vary within a continuum from narrowly to widely ranged. Considering that different calibration areas generate different range size predictions (Giovanelli, de Siqueira, Haddad, &amp; Alexandrino, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>), performing the ENMs with different calibration areas for each species would become logistically complex and difficult to interpret (Vasconcelos et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). Then, in order to perform a standardized procedure than to a species‐by‐species treatment regarding the climate variable selection, we considered a single (continental) calibration area for the modeling procedure. From the 19 climatic variables available in the WorldClim portal at a spatial resolution of ~10 km (Hijmans, Cameron, Parra, Jones, &amp; Jarvis,

These variables were selected based on their variance inflation factors (VIFs). We calculated their VIFs and excluded the variables with highest VIF until all variables presented VIF lower than 10.0, thus representing no collinearity problems for model building (Naimi &amp; Araújo, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0042" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). The same variables, at the same spatial resolution and also available at the WorldClim portal (

For each future time slice (2050 and 2070), we used two representative concentration pathways (RCPs) of two CO
