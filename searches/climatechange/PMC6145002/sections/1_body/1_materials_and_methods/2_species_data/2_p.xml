<p class="p">Based on the work of Haddad et al. (

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), there are 529 and 209 anurans occurring within the AF and CER, respectively. First, we surveyed the geographic coordinates of these species from two open‐access digital databases that provide occurrence data from biological surveys and museum collections (the Global Biodiversity Information Facility, GBIF: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gbif.org" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.gbif.org</ext-link>; the SpeciesLink project: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://splink.cria.org.br" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://splink.cria.org.br</ext-link>). Due to the geographic bias on occurrence records from these online databases (e.g., Beck, Böller, Erhardt, &amp; Schwanghart, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; Vasconcelos &amp; Nascimento, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0058" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we also made use of the following two sources to collect thorough point occurrence records of each species: a) museum and scientific collections, mainly those not hosted by GBIF and SpeciesLink and/or representative of different regions within the AF and CER: 
 <italic class="italic">Museu Nacional/Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro</italic> (Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil), 
 <italic class="italic">Museu de Zoologia da Universidade Federal da Bahia</italic> (Salvador, BA, Brazil), 
 <italic class="italic">Coleção Herpetológica da Universidade Federal de Santa Maria</italic> (Santa Maria, RS, Brazil), and the American Museum of Natural History (New York, NY, USA); and b) literature records focusing on journals prioritizing publications on species list and/or geographic distribution updates. Occurrence records of those species also occurring outside the AF and CER borders were considered in the dataset. All records were carefully examined, species by species, for probable errors. Therefore, we removed duplicate and/or imprecise species records, such as those occurrences outside the geographic species ranges according to Frost (
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>) and/or to the pertinent literature of a given species. Records from introduced species were not considered (e.g., 
 <italic class="italic">Lithobates catesbeianus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Xenopus laevis</italic>). The amphibian nomenclature followed Frost (
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0020" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2017</xref>). This survey resulted in a total of 512 anuran species in the AF (with a total of 18,799 occurrence points) and 197 anuran species in the CER (with a total of 16,387 occurrence points) (Supporting Information Tables

 <xref rid="ece34357-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material" class="xref">S2</xref>). After removing those species with fewer than five occurrence records due to modeling limitations (e.g., Hernandez, Graham, Master, &amp; Albert, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0026" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2006</xref>; Ochoa‐Ochoa, Urbina‐Cardona, Vázquez, Flores‐Villela, &amp; Bezaury‐Creel,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0062" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), we were able to generate the ENMs for 350 anuran species in the AF and 155 species in the CER.
