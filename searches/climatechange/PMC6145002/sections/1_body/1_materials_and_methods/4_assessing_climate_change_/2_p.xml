<p class="p">Here, we consider the patterns of alpha diversity (i.e., grids representing local sites) as a representation of local species richness (e.g., Davey, Devictor, Jonzén, Lindström, &amp; Smith, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0014" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>; Molinos et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). To do so, each predictive binary species map was summed up in a ~50 × 50 km grid system of the AF and CER, a procedure repeated for each time slice. The richness values of each grid cell were compared with the future against current richness predictions by paired 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> tests to evaluate the effects of climate change on the anuran alpha diversity, and were also used to make up ladder plots with the predicted richness grid values across time slices (e.g., Loyola, Lemes, Brum, Provete, &amp; Duarte, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Additional calculation of gains and losses in species richness between future and current predictions, as well as the confection of final maps, were performed using ArcGIS10.1.
