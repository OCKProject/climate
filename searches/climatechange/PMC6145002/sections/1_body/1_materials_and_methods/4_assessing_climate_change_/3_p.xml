<p class="p">The patterns of AF and CER anuran beta diversity for different time slices were considered by the calculation of the LCBD index, as proposed by Legendre and De Cáceres (
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). In summary, the presence/absence anuran matrix, independently performed for different time slices for each hotspot, was submitted to the Jaccard dissimilarity coefficient (Bjac) in order to compute the total variance of the community composition. Then, the LCBD was determined based on the partition of total beta diversity among the sites, obtained from the Jaccard dissimilarity matrix, to obtain the relative contribution of sampling units (i.e., grid cells) to beta diversity. The LCBD values can be mapped and represent comparative indicators of the ecological uniqueness of the sites in terms of community composition. That is, the LCBD values indicate the sites that contribute more (or less) than average to beta diversity; large LCBD values may indicate sites having unusual species combinations and of high conservation values compared to the total local (i.e., grid cell) communities (Legendre &amp; De Cáceres, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0031" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). We also tested the significance of the LCBD values of each cell by performing permutations in which the species are random and independently distributed of one another among the grid cells (Legendre &amp; De Cáceres,
