<p class="p">Ecological Niche Models generally characterize the ecological niche of a species usually considering its climatic preferences based on known occurrence records (Elith &amp; Burgman, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0017" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). Further, the species climatic niche is projected on a bioclimatic envelope of interest, which can be a different geographic region (Giovanelli, Haddad, &amp; Alexandrino, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0023" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2008</xref>) or different climate scenarios of the same geographic extent (Vasconcelos &amp; Nascimento, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0059" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2016</xref>). Even whether these ENMs present commission errors (i.e., the model predicts species presence where there is no occurrence record), these errors may be predictions of interest if the intuit is to look for potential or abiotically suitable areas of a species in future climate change scenarios (Araújo &amp; Peterson, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0004" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>). An alternative to this correlative approach is the use of mechanistic niche models. The mechanistic approach considers some taxon‐specific parameters that provide information on population attributes, physiological limits, and/or biotic interactions for a more precise distribution model (e.g., Pacifici et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Nonetheless, mechanistic approaches often focus on a single species with conservation relevance because data on population ecology and/or organisms’ physiology are costly and time‐consuming, which thus make the use of correlative niche models appropriate when the only data available are those on species’ occurrence (Pacifici et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0045" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>).
