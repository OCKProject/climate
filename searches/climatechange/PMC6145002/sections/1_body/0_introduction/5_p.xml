<p class="p">In this study, we evaluate the alpha and beta diversity metrics of anuran amphibians in the Brazilian hotspots of biodiversity conservation (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>): the Atlantic Forest (AF) and Cerrado (CER) (sensu Mittermeier et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0039" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Anurans are highly diverse in the AF, with approximately 550 species, of which ~80% are endemic to this hotspot (Haddad et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0025" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>). The main determinants of this high diversity have been attributed to the high humidity levels and number of aquatic micro‐habitats that may have led to the diversification of different reproductive modes, mainly in the moist forests, the rough topography that may have promoted speciation of micro‐endemic species, and the climatic stability of some areas since the Pleistocene glaciations (da Silva, Almeida‐Neto, Prado, Haddad, &amp; Rossa‐Feres,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0063" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2010</xref>). With a predominance of open vegetation formations, less humidity, and a markedly seasonal climate, anurans in the CER are less diverse than in the AF. There are 209 anuran species recorded in the CER, yet high levels of endemism rates are also recorded in this area (approximately 51.7% are endemic species) (Valdujo, Silvano, Colli, &amp; Martins, 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0055" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>).
