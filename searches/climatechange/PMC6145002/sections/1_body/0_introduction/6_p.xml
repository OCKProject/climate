<p class="p">We evaluate here how the effects of climate change are presumed to impact the species richness gradients and the beta diversity structure of anurans in the AF and CER Brazilian hotspots. Specifically, we make use of ENMs to generate the climatically suitable area of the species, considering the baseline and future climate change scenarios, in order to answer the following questions: (a) How is climate change expected to change the anuran richness gradients in the AF and CER? (b) Where, in the geographical space, are the areas located with predicted losses and gains in species richness? (c) How is climate change expected to change the location of areas having unique species composition (i.e., high beta diversity values)? and (d) How is climate change expected to change the structure of anuran beta diversity (i.e., the relative importance of nestedness and turnover components) in the AF and CER?</p>
