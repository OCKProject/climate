<p class="p">The potential impacts of climate change in the Brazilian hotspots are not expected to drastically change the distribution of the anuran richness gradients, but to negatively impact their whole extensions (i.e., cause species losses throughout the hotspots), except the northeastern CER region that is expected to gain in species. Areas having unique species composition are expected to decrease in northeastern CER, whereas an associated increase is expected in southeastern/southwestern areas under climate change. High beta diversity areas in future scenarios are expected to remain in the same locations as the prediction of the baseline climate in the AF, but the major tendency of species loss under climate change is expected to increase the nestedness component of the anuran beta diversity in the hotspot. Therefore, all these results suggest that the lack of similar climatically suitable area for most species will be the main challenge that they will face in the future. However, some concerns not addressed in our modeling framework may generate different patterns in the future: (a) anurans in the CER may have the opportunity to explore new savannah areas predicted to expand northwestward in projected climate change scenarios, whereas the AF anurans will have only few new forested areas projected in the southern rim of the hotspot (Nobre et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0051" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2007</xref>); (b) the richness gradients and beta diversity patterns might also be affected by the arrival of new species currently inhabiting the adjacent biomes (Loyola et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2018</xref>); and (c) the current rates of habitat loss that both hotspots have faced during the last century might cause even more species loss and the increase of the nestedness in the structure of the anuran beta diversity in the studied areas. Then, an integration of the present framework coupled to the above‐mentioned concerns is ideally the best procedure to obtain effective decisions for conservation actions that will therefore need to anticipate and accommodate such changes in climate (Luo et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0040" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2015</xref>). Finally, gathering different biological metrics, as we did for anurans herein, and for a wide range of taxa and different future climate change scenarios, is an important step for conservation biogeography of the threatened biomes.
