<p class="p">The first expected impact of climate change on the AF and CER anurans is the extinction of 42 species (37 species in the AF and five in the CER) by means of their complete loss of climatically suitable areas by 2050 and 2070. Lemes, Melo, and Loyola (

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>) already documented predicted extinctions of some AF anurans by 2050, either in a smaller (Lemes et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0033" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>; : nine out of 430 species analyzed – 2.09%) or a higher proportion (Loyola et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0035" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>: 52 out of 431 species – ~12%) than that recorded herein (37 out of 350 species: 10.57%). These percentage differences may be accounted for the differences in the study designs and performed modeling techniques, but the important message here is that if these anurans no longer have physiological, morphological, or behavioral adaptations to accommodate to novel climatic conditions, or whether they are unable to change their particular timing of life‐history events to avoid the months with unfavorable climates (Bellard et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0008" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2012</xref>), they are presumed to contract their ranges until extinction due to the fact that they have no climatically suitable area predicted by 2050 and/or 2070. In the present study, these predictions are more worrisome for the fate of some already endangered AF anurans, such as

Additionally, since decision‐makers use the distribution criteria to evaluate the risk category of species, the threatened status might be higher in the future than the current list due to the tendency for range contraction of species (Lemes et al.,
