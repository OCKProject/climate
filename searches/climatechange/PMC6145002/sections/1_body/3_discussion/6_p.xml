<p class="p">Because different anuran species pools have been identified between and within the analyzed hotspots (e.g., Valdujo, Carnaval, &amp; Graham,

 <xref rid="ece34357-bib-0060" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>), we expected that the main component structuring the patterns of beta diversity of both hotspots, irrespective of the climate scenarios, would be accounted for the species replacement along their geographic extents. These expectations were confirmed, but we also found different and interesting results for the climate change impacts on the anuran beta diversity in the AF and CER: (a) the anuran composition along the CER extension tends to be more homogeneous under the climate change scenarios, as indicated by the lowest beta diversity dissimilarity values across time in this hotspot, with an associated decrease in the importance of the turnover and nestedness values; (b) although the dissimilarity values of beta diversity in the AF are similar across time, which means that the degree of changes in the anuran composition along the AF is expected to be the same among the different time slices, the nestedness component has increased values in the climate change predictions while the turnover component decreases. The nestedness component becomes higher in the AF under the climate change probably as a reflection of the loss of climatically suitable areas for 37 species and the tendency for range contractions for AF anurans that resulted in species losses per cell (e.g., Lemes et al.,

Spatially speaking, there is no such a deep change in the distribution of beta diversity in the AF across time, so the use of beta diversity distribution patterns for conservation purposes in the AF (e.g., Legendre,
