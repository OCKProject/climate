<p class="p">All four modeling methods had strong predictive power, with mean AUC ±

 <italic class="italic">SD</italic> values of 0.938 ± 0.069 and 0.863 ± 0.139 (BRT), 0.936 ± 0.065 and 0.871 ± 0.129 (GLM), 0.973 ± 0.045 and 0.928 ± 0.107 (RF), and 0.972 ± 0.052 and 0.934 ± 0.112 (SVM), which indicate good model fit for the species predictions. Of the 350 AF anuran species, 8.29% (29 species) are predicted to have no climatically suitable area by 2050 and 2070, and other eight species will have some climatically suitable area by 2050 but not by 2070 (Table 
 <xref rid="ece34357-tbl-0001" ref-type="table" class="xref">1</xref>). Of the 155 anurans in the CER, only 1.93% (three species) are presumed to have no climatically suitable area by 2050 and 2070, and two more species that have some predicted area by 2050 but are presumed to totally lose their climatically suitable areas by 2070 (Table
