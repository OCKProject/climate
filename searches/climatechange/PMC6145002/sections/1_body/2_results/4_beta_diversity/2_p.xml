<p class="p">The patterns of beta diversity distribution in the AF depict that unique anuran compositions are found in the whole northern region, in a narrow region in the southeastern coast, in part of the southern region, and in some specific inland regions in transition zones with the CER (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). This pattern is overall similar among the current, 2050, and 2070 predictions, but the main difference among them is an increase across time in high beta diversity neighboring cells of the mentioned high beta diversity regions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0005" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). The dissimilarity values of anuran beta diversity in the AF show that the level of changes in the anuran composition across time is quite similar among them (current Bjac = 0.354; 2050 Bjac = 0.355; 2070 Bjac = 0.359). In the CER, all predictions depict high anuran beta diversity in the northern/northeastern, southeastern/southwestern, and fewer regions in the central and western regions of the hotspot (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The main difference among the current, 2050, and 2070 predictions is that the climate change scenarios identify a wider southeastern/southwestern area having high anuran beta diversity when compared to current predictions, whereas a smaller area in the northeastern portion of the CER is predicted for the future scenarios (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0006" ref-type="fig" class="xref">6</xref>). The anuran composition in the CER is presumed to become more homogeneous in future climate change scenarios since the average anuran beta diversity decreases from the current (current Bjac = 0.331) to future predictions (2050 Bjac = 0.303; 2070 Bjac = 0.298).
