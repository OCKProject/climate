<p class="p">The partitioning of beta diversity into components of spatial turnover and nestedness reveals that the replacement of species among the grids is the main component of the beta diversity for both hotspots and time slices (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). Though the turnover component remains the main component of the beta diversity of both hotspots in the future, the climate change scenarios are expected to cause different changes in the importance of the beta diversity components of each hotspot. In the AF, although the similarity values of beta diversity tend to remain similar among the current, 2050, and 2070 predictions, as mentioned above; the nestedness component becomes higher in future climate change scenarios than the baseline predictions while the turnover component shows the inverse pattern (i.e., the replacement values decrease across time) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>). In the CER, either the turnover and nestedness components of beta diversity decrease from baseline to future climate scenarios, with an associate increase in the similarity values of the Bjac in future predictions (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0007" ref-type="fig" class="xref">7</xref>).
