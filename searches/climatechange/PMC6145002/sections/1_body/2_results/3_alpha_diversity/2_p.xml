<p class="p">The mean richness per grid is expected to decrease across time in the AF (current‐2050:

 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = −12.947, 
 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.000; current‐2070: 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> = −13.76,

 <italic class="italic">p</italic> = 0.000) (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0002" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), although gains in species richness can be expected in future scenarios for some specific regions of both hotspots, but mainly in the northeastern region of CER (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref>). The maximum richness value reached by a grid cell in the AF is 242 species for the baseline climate, 222 for 2050, and 221 species for the 2070 climate change consensus scenarios (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). This decreasing tendency is also found for the CER, in which 95 species are predicted in the richest cell for the baseline climate, 91 for 2050, and 89 species for the 2070 climate change consensus scenario (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Regarding richness gradients, the climate change scenarios do not change the fact that the higher anuran species richness is found in the coastal rim of the AF, mainly in southeastern Brazil, whereas the lower anuran richness is found in inland places, away from the Atlantic coast (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Similarly, anuran richness in the CER is broadly congruent among different climate change scenarios; the higher species richness is found in southeastern areas of the CER and, to a lesser extent, some central and southwestern areas, whereas lower richness is found in the northern and northeastern Cerrado (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). The major impacts of climate change on the richness gradients in the AF are found in specific inland regions of the southeastern and southern Brazil where anuran richness is expected to decrease by 2050 and 2070 (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). Though the decrease in anuran richness is expected to happen in the southeastern, southwestern, and western regions of the CER by 2050 and 2070, most northeastern grids of the CER are expected to gain in species by 2050 (Figures 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0003" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="ece34357-fig-0004" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>).
