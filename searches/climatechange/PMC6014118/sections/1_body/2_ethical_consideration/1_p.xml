<p class="p">The study dealt with human subjects, hence bringing to the fore a host of ethical considerations the researchers observed. The principle of informed consent guided the researchers in the data-gathering process. Polit and Beck (
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2004</xref>:151) state that informed consent means that participants adequately inform the respondents about the nature of the research and they are capable of ‘comprehending the information and have the power of free choice, enabling them to consent voluntary to participate in the research or decline participation’. The respondents were also offered an option to opt out of the research whenever they felt uncomfortable. The researchers asked for approval from the Umguza Rural District Council to conduct the study. Because data was gathered at the household level, the researchers sought the participation of adults in all the sampled households. Again, all participants were informed of the nature of the research in terms of its scope and objectives and all the gathered information was treated with confidentiality.
