<p class="p">Some communal farmers expressed concerns over the media use of jargons, which they said made it difficult for them to adapt to the changing climatic patterns, as in most cases they fail to understand the meaning of those words. This supports Peters (
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2012</xref>) observation that scientists and journalists are like strangers, unable to understand each other’s language whilst Hartz and Chappell (
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1997</xref>:22) add that ‘many otherwise well-educated writers and reporters have never taken the time to become familiar with the culture of science, its language and its methods’. As such, this relationship between science and journalism negatively affects the way communal farmers interact with media texts in efforts to adapt to climate change, as they will also fail to understand the meaning of certain climate change jargons in some media texts. The literacy levels of communal farmers in the District highlighted earlier further make it difficult for them to grasp these jargons, which even the journalists also fail to understand at times.
