<p class="p">The findings show the importance of opinion leaders in influencing communal farmers’ interaction with media content, the same as Nisbet and Kotcher (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>:328) who established that opinion leaders are an essential ‘resource for collective action on climate change adaptation’. These findings can also be explained using the Two-Step Flow theory. However, unlike Nisbet and Kotcher (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) and Steinberg (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>), the study established that the influence of opinion leaders is at times overestimated, as there are cases where they were over powered by observations and experiences of communal farmers. This was clearly visible in Majindane with the decline in the uptake of CA just a few years after being successfully introduced by Agritex with the support of opinion leaders. The researchers observed that many communal farmers were sceptical and had stopped using the technique despite encouragement from opinion leaders and the media, as they believed it was incompatible with their settings.
