The readings can be categorised as dominant, negotiated or oppositional (Hall 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1978</xref>).Dominant reading is when the audiences accept the producer’s meaning, whilst in negotiated reading, they accept certain elements in media content and mix them with their own values and oppositional reading is when they totally reject the producer’s meaning and adopt the opposite. Hall (

As such, one of the three readings can be used to understand Umguza District communal farmer’s interaction with climate change adaptation media content.
