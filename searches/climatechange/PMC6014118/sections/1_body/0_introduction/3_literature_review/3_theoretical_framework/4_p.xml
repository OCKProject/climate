<p class="p">Nisbet and Kotcher (
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2009</xref>) established that opinion leaders are necessary resources on climate change adaptation. Smith (
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) identified two forms of opinion leaders, namely formal opinion leaders comprising structural leaders elected to office and informal leaders exerting influence because of the knowledge of particular issues. This is in line with the Two-Step Flow theory, stating that media content moves in two stages. Steinberg (
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2007</xref>:266) notes that opinion leaders who are frequent media users obtain the information and ‘pass it along to those who are less exposed to media through informal and interpersonal communication’. It should be noted that whilst communicating the information, opinion leaders also add their interpretations and hence changing the meaning of the contents (Steinberg
