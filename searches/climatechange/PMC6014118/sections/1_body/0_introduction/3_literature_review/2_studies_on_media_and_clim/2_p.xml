In Zimbabwe, a few studies have combined climate change and the media and most, if not all, focused on the media’s framing of the phenomenon, neglecting the audiences. Mare (

 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) discovered that 
 <italic class="italic">The Standard</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sunday News</italic> reported on climate change when there were events that could fit into the journalistic news values. These studies opened a gap for an audience-oriented study exploring their interaction with media content.
