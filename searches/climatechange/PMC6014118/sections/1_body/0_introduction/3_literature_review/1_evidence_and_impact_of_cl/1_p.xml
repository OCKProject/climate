<p class="p">Climate change refers to changes in long-term weather patterns (climate) caused by natural or external forces – attributed directly or indirectly to human activity (IPCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2001</xref>; UNFCCC 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>). There is documented scientific evidence indicating that Zimbabwe is experiencing adverse effects of climate change. Unganai (
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1996</xref>) contends that day temperatures soared by 0.8 °C from 1933 to 1993, whilst precipitation dropped by up to 10% during the same period. There have been severe dry spells, flooding, cyclones and heat waves linked to the impact of climate change (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Management 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>). As from 2000, tropical cyclones such as Cyclone Eline which made land fall in 2000, Cyclone Hudah and Cyclone Gloria have wreaked havoc, destroying buildings and agricultural produces. There have also been long dry spells with the most notable being in 1982, 1992 and 2002. The negative impact of climate change is worsened by the country’s dependence on agriculture, as it is an economic pillar.
