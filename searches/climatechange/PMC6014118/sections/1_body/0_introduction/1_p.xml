<p class="p">The study, based in Umguza District in Matabeleland North Province, explored how communal farmers created meaning out of climate change adaptation media content and its influence on their farming practices from October 2014 to April 2015. Climate change is having a devastating impact on most agricultural activities in Zimbabwe. Climate change refers to changes in long-term weather patterns or averages, and this can be because of natural or external forces – attributed directly or indirectly to human activity (IPCC

 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1992</xref>). In Zimbabwe, climate change has largely manifested itself in declining rainfall patterns and increase in temperatures (Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Management

As communal farmers seem to struggle to make sense of and adapt to these catastrophic changes, the media is expected to assume a theoretical role of educating and informing them about the appropriate adaptation techniques. Adaptation in agricultural context refers to strategies farmers implement to maximise production regardless of changing climate patterns (Black

A broad definition of the media was adopted, encompassing micro-media – targeting a private and direct audience like social media- and macro-media – targeting a large audience ranging from mainstream radio and television to newspapers (Shelton
