 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), came up with important findings, emphasising the need for climate change adaptation in developing countries. Banda (
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>) warns that African countries must prioritise climate change adaptation if they are to increase their agricultural output. On the other hand, studies on media and climate change, such as that by Count-Evans (
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2013</xref>), focused on how the media communicates climate change with little regard to how farmers receive the information and its influence on their farming practices. The study filled this gap and the findings will assist policy makers, broadcast, print and online media content producers and development agencies to improve climate change communication and enhance the adaptation processes in Zimbabwe, as they will understand factors influencing communal farmersâ€™ interaction with media content and its influence on their agricultural practices.
