<p class="p">Matabeleland region covers Bulawayo Metropolitan, Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North. The region accesses almost all macro-media reaching or based in Bulawayo including the 
 <italic class="italic">Chronicle</italic>, a government-controlled publication and the 
 <italic class="italic">Southern Eye</italic>, a private newspaper owned by Alpha Media Holdings (AMH). At the time of presenting and analysing data, the 
 <italic class="italic">Southern Eye</italic> had shut down its print edition but continued publishing online and as a pull-out section in its sister daily newspaper, 
 <italic class="italic">News Day. The Zimbabwe Mail</italic>, owned by the then Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development, Dr Obert Mpofu, was also one of the publications based in Bulawayo before ceasing publication on 20 March 2015. This left the region with only one vibrant daily newspaper, the 
 <italic class="italic">Chronicle.</italic> However, there are also three other daily publications based in Harare and accessible in the region â€“ 
 <italic class="italic">The Herald,</italic> a government-controlled publication, 
 <italic class="italic">News Day</italic> owned by AMH and 
 <italic class="italic">Daily News</italic> owned by Associated Newspapers of Zimbabwe (ANZ).
