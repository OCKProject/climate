<p id="Par32" class="p">There are at least two possible explanations for the discrepancy between people’s answers to open-ended versus closed-ended answers about climate and health. One is that many people are more knowledgeable and perceive more risk than their open-ended responses suggest, but because the issue has low salience to them, specific health impacts and risk groups do not come to mind unless specifically prompted (by follow-on or closed-ended questions). Another possibility—made plausible by the fact that the majority of people surveyed hold negative views about global warming—is that many people do not have prior perceptions about the health relevance of climate change, but when asked closed-ended questions about the topic, they draw on their preexisting negative views about the issue in general to generate answers to specific questions about climate and health. Which explanation(s) best account for the discrepancy between the findings resulting from open-ended and closed-ended questions is not yet clear.</p>
