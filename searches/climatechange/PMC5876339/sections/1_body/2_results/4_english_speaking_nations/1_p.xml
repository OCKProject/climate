<p id="Par31" class="p">Ten studies have been done to assess public understanding of the health impacts of climate change in English-speaking countries; most of this research has been conducted in Canada [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>] and the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">36</xref>]. Overall, it appears that relatively few Canadians and Americans associate climate change and health harms; most report they have given little thought to the issue [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>]. The depth of participants’ knowledge and risk perceptions is difficult to assess because people’s answers to open-ended questions give the impression of relatively little knowledge and risk perception [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>], whereas people’s answers to closed-ended questions demonstrate much higher level of risk perception [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" class="xref">39</xref>]. Specifically, only a minority of survey participants answer open-ended questions in ways that suggest they know anything about how climate change harms health, or who is most likely to be harmed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" class="xref">38</xref>]. However, when asked specific closed-ended questions, a majority of respondents answer in a manner indicating that they do perceive climate change to be harmful to health [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">37</xref>].
