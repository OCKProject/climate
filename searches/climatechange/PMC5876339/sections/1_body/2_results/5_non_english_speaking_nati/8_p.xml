<p id="Par43" class="p">A series of studies conducted by Levine and Kline [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">57</xref>], however, provides a cautionary note. In three experiments—field experiments and web-based experiments—they found that climate messages intended to make people concerned about their own health successfully heighten people’s concerns about climate change, but paradoxically they also reduce people’s rate of political participation (e.g., signing a petition, or joining a climate advocacy organization) to express their concern. The hypothesized mechanism of the paradoxical finding is that when people feel their material resources are threatened (in this case, their health), their response is to conserve their resources by avoiding additional commitments (presumably so as to better withstand resource constraints that may be forthcoming).
