 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70" class="xref">70</xref>]. Our conclusion from the studies reviewed for RQ3 is that there may be merit to this communication strategy. At least some evidence suggests that learning about the health relevance of climate change and climate solutions helps stimulate public engagement, particularly among vulnerable people and households, and conservatives. The largest study to examine this question to date—which was not included in our review (but is currently under review)—found that American adults who read brief essays about the eight categories of health impacts of climate change—as summarized from the National Climate and Health Assessment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>]—became more cognitively and affectively engaged in the issue of global warming, especially people with a chronic illness, and political moderates and conservatives. These findings are promising in that the health angle can bring new constituencies and perspective to local, state, and national policy discourses about climate change mitigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71" class="xref">71</xref>]. This would appear to be a promising area for further research.
