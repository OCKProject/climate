  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">7</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">9</xref>
 </sup>. A prevailing ‘biodiversity syndrome’ emerging from these climatic changes is the rapid alterations of the geographic ranges observed across a broad range of species

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" class="xref">3</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">12</xref>
 </sup>. Such geographic shifts are the result of species displacements tracking their rapidly moving historical niches as warming advances across space

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" class="xref">13</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" class="xref">10</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" class="xref">14</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" class="xref">16</xref>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. Therefore, species restricted to mountaintops and continental margins are more likely to experience progressive losses of suitable areas as warming advances, hence, forcing either rapid adaptations to the new climatic conditions, or extinctions

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>. The steepness of mountain slopes also increases the severity of climatic and ecological gradients in a more reduced geographic space (relative to flat regions), further aggravating the increases of extinction risks in species from high elevations

 </sup>. In addition to pressures emerging from the environment, the magnitude of species’ responses to climate change importantly depends on their ecological tolerance as a function of intrinsic factors such as genetic variation, population size, and generation time

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" class="xref">23</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" class="xref">25</xref>
 </sup>. In recent years, research efforts have focused on identifying mechanisms behind such spatial asymmetries in responses to contemporary climate change, leading to reinforce the focus on a range of phenological, ecological, and physiological factors as primary factors underlying extinction risks
