<p id="Par14" class="p">We gathered a large-scale dataset encompassing three lizard radiations differing in their patterns of geographic distribution and in parity modes, which spans large species-samples of 
 <italic class="italic">Liolaemus</italic> (40 oviparous and 52 viviparous species), 
 <italic class="italic">Phymaturus</italic> (11 species, exclusively viviparous – although our dataset contained data for most species within this genus, we excluded most of them given their extremely limited geographic range sizes, which makes it inviable to perform the analyses employed to address our core predictions), and 
 <italic class="italic">Stenocercus</italic> (40 species, exclusively oviparous) (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">S1</xref>). The distributional and life-history data comprise 4,532 geographic occurrence records (after all duplicated points collected from different individuals at same localities were removed). This includes all known records of presence of these lizards following 20+ years of field and museum work, and museum-validated published occurrences

 <italic class="italic">Phymaturus</italic> and Omar Torres-Carvajal: 
 <italic class="italic">Stenocercus</italic>, to assure accuracy).
