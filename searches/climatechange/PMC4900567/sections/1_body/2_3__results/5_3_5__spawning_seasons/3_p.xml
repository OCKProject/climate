 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156143.g009" class="xref">Fig 9</xref>). The GSI was significantly different between months both for females (χ² = 115.94, df = 11, p-value &lt; 0.05) and for males (χ² = 203.99, df = 11, p-value &lt; 0.05). GSI was highly variable between August and September and between January and February. There were two spawning peaks in June and February for males and females with lower levels of spawning from June to August. In October, there was a higher presence of stage V and higher GSI simultaneously compared to September and November both for males and females and, therefore, there was probably a short reproductive period. There was a resting period in September and from November to December.
