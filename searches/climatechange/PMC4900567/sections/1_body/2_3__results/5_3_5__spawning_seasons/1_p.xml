 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> spawns throughout the year in Senegal. However, two main reproductive periods can be defined from the analysis of sexual maturity stages and GSI. In this study, the reproductive period was considered to be the whole cycle of gonad maturation up to spawning. The first reproductive period occurred from April to October. Within this period, gonad maturation occurred in April, June and September while spawning occurred mainly from June to August and in October. The analysis of sexual maturity stages showed that individuals in stages I, II, and VI were present in November and December, after the first reproductive period. A second reproductive period, with continuous spawning (more intense than during the first period), occurred from January to the end of February with the gonad maturation period in December.
