 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> was biased in favor of females (55.81%; n = 1068). The proportion of females was significantly higher in the hot season (SR = 58.97%, χ ² = 13.82, df = 1, p-value &lt; 0.05) compared to the cold season (SR = 53.68%, χ ² = 3.45, df = 1, p-value = 0.06). The sex ratio broken down by size class was male-biased between 15 to 22 cm while females dominated under 15 cm and over 22 cm (
