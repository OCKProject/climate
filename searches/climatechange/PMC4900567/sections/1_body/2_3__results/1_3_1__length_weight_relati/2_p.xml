 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156143.g003" class="xref">Fig 3</xref>. The average CF calculated from a total of 5,660 individuals was equal to 1.01 ± 0.11. Comparisons of CF between months using the Kruskal-Wallis test suggested significant differences (χ² = 1814.64, df = 11, p-value &lt; 0.05), which were confirmed for several monthly pairs by pairwise comparisons using the Kruskal-Wallis Multiple Comparison test (
