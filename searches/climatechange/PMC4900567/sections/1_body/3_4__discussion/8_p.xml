 <xref rid="pone.0156143.t006" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 6</xref>), even if locally in the northern coast of Senegal it was reported a sex ratio slightly male biased (~51%). Two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this. On the one hand, for several fish species, warmer waters increase the female bias [

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref050" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">50</xref>]. This is in line with our observations in Senegal and with an even higher female bias being found in Cameroon (warm waters) but it does not explain the high female bias in Mauritania, where the temperature is usually lower. On the other hand, the “Petite Côte” is a well-known

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref007" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">7</xref>] and favorable area for fish larval development due to high phytoplankton biomass production and favorable environmental conditions, e.g. high coastal retention for eggs and larvae, in particular during the hot season [

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref052" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">52</xref>]. Thus in this area and this season, the female bias may be due to an evolutionary strategy giving a better reproduction efficiency for short-lived fish species. This mechanism may also explain the high female bias in Mauritania and Cameroon because the samples were collected in the local reproduction area [
