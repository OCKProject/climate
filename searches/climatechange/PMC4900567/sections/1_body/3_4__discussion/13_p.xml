<p class="p">The biological parameters of sardinella were expected to change with the effect of climate change and overfishing [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. It was expected that either the effect of fishing pressure (which has increased considerably in Senegal over the last decades [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>]) or the effect of the environment differences would have been detectable. Nevertheless the results of this study are consistent with those previously reported in the literature studied and suggest that

 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> has not been affected by overfishing or global climate change despite its habitat covering very different marine ecosystems including the Canary Current and the Guinea Current Large Marine Ecosystem. This narrow plasticity of the biological parameters studied should be taken into account in fishery management plans.
