 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic>, as well as its growth and reproductive patterns, are closely related to the dynamics of the upwelling systems [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref006" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">6</xref>]. Adaptation of the biological parameters of the species to environments with different upwelling intensity should be expected. On the northwest African coast, the upwelling is stronger than in the other areas, permanent in the north of Mauritania and from November to May further south in Senegalese waters. The results were also compared with earlier measurements for Senegal to determine whether the biological parameters had changed with an increase in SST of 0.03Â°C per year over the past 30 years [
