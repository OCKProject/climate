<p class="p">The growth performance index of

 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> estimated in this study (

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.t003" ref-type="table" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). However, it would seem that the low value in the Congo was due to an error because this was the only value outside the range of all other studies including studies in the same area. Our results also confirm other observations in Senegal in 1986 [

 <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
 <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> reached 17 cm to 18 cm body length at the age of 12 months in Senegal based on scale aging, with the growth rate decreasing until the fish approached their asymptotic length at around 3 years [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. The results of different methods of aging fish (length-frequency analysis (this study and [
