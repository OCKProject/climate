The trophic and ontogenetic migrations of sardinella are related to the strong seasonal variations in the southeastern edge of the Canary Upwelling System, an eastern boundary upwelling current [

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref008" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">8</xref>]. Sardinella are found along the north and west African coast from the Mediterranean Sea to Cape Frio in Angola, mainly in coastal upwelling areas off northwest Africa (10–26°N), in the Gulf of Guinea off Ghana and the Ivory Coast and in the south from Gabon to Angola (0–18°S) [
