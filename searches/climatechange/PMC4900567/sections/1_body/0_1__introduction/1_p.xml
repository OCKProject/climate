<p class="p">In Senegal (West Africa), coastal pelagic fishes are the most important marine resource, accounting for about 64% of annual catches [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref001" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">1</xref>]. Small pelagic fishes, such as sardinella (
 <italic class="italic">Sardinella aurita</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">Sardinella maderensis</italic>), have long been known to play a key role in the food supply for local communities. The catches of marine fisheries reached 448,000 t in 2012, the highest on record in Senegal [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. More than 288,000 t of the catch was made up of small pelagic fish, of which 86% were sardinella (119,000 t for

 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref002" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Sardinella are short-lived, zooplankton feeders with similar shape and size (maximum fork-length ~30 cm). Sardinella stocks have been considered to be overexploited since 2006 [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref003" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">3</xref>] by small-scale fishing canoes, a few local purse seiners, large foreign fishing vessels operating within the framework of bilateral agreements and often illegal, unreported, unregulated (IUU) fishing fleets [
