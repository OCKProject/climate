This study updated these parameters using more recent data from small-scale fisheries and published datasets to detect any changes that may have occurred as a result of climate change and/or over-fishing. The amount of food available from the environment may well change the amount of food reserves fish can build up or the energy they can invest in growth or reproduction [
