<p class="p">The Shapiro test was used the assumption of normality and Bartlett’s test was used for the assumption of homogeneity of variance as Student’s t-test assumes that the observations within each group are normally distributed and that the variances are equal in both groups. Student’s t-test was used to assess the effect of season (hot versus cold) on individual sizes, when the Shapiro and Bartlett’s tests confirmed normality and homogeneity of variance. Otherwise, non-parametric Wilcoxon tests were used.</p>
