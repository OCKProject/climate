<p class="p">Seasonal upwelling occurs along the Senegalese coast between November and May, maintaining a relatively low sea surface temperature depending on the strength of the wind (~15–18°C) [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref013" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">13</xref>]. The upwelling becomes permanent further to the north (in Mauritania). This upwelling is closely related to atmospheric dynamics and is determined by the seasonal changes in the direction of the trade winds associated with the migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) [
 <xref rid="pone.0156143.ref014" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>]. The trade winds stop in Senegal from June to October and a moderate northward current brings warm (&gt; 25°C) water to the coast, which can be seen as an extension of the North Equatorial Countercurrent.
