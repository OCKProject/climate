<p class="p">Flat sardinella catches landed by small-scale fisheries were sampled monthly from March 2012 to February 2013. Purse seine and gill nets were the main fishing gear used. This study sampled only specimens caught using purse seine nets to have the same fishing gear selectivity for monthly comparisons of the length distribution. When available, up to 500 individuals were sampled from the three main landing sites: Kayar, Mbour and Joal (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0156143.g001" class="xref">Fig 1</xref>). Interviews with fisherman (36 interviews; with one per month per site) performed during the sampling campaign, indicated that canoes fishing with purse seine nets at Kayar covered the area 15° 50’ N to 14° 80’ N. Mbour and Joal had overlapping fishing zones ranging from 14° 30’ N (in Senegal) to 13°48’ N (in Gambian waters).
