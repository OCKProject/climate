 <p class="p">The stock of the Senegalese flat sardinella, 
  <italic class="italic">Sardinella maderensis</italic>, is highly exploited in Senegal, West Africa. Its growth and reproduction parameters are key biological indicators for improving fisheries management. This study reviewed these parameters using landing data from small-scale fisheries in Senegal and literature information dated back more than 25 years. Age was estimated using length-frequency data to calculate growth parameters and assess the growth performance index. With global climate change there has been an increase in the average sea surface temperature along the Senegalese coast but the length-weight parameters, sex ratio, size at first sexual maturity, period of reproduction and condition factor of 
  <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> have not changed significantly. The above parameters of 
  <italic class="italic">S</italic>. 
  <italic class="italic">maderensis</italic> have hardly changed, despite high exploitation and fluctuations in environmental conditions that affect the early development phases of small pelagic fish in West Africa. This lack of plasticity of the species regarding of the biological parameters studied should be considered when planning relevant fishery management plans.
