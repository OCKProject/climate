<p id="Par52" class="p">Air movement around the body increases convective heat loss to the environment when the air temperature is lower than the skin temperature. The average skin temperature in a thermo-neutral environment is about 34 °C, which means that in many situations, increased ventilation leads to increased heat loss from the body. The skin temperature may increase a few degrees, e.g. 1–4 °C when exposed to heat. In such situations, ventilation can still benefit evaporative cooling if air humidity has not reached saturation (i.e. relative humidity of air is less than 100%). The study on a thermal manikin with constant surface temperature (T

 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 34 °C, RH = 60%, v
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 0.4 m/s), indicated that the ventilation clothes enhanced evaporative cooling compared with nude and a normally clothed manikin (Gao et al.

 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 38 °C, RH = 45% and v
 <sub class="sub">a</sub> = 0.4 m/s). The results showed that the cooling effect was mainly limited to torso skin. Although the thermal sensations for both the whole body and the torso were alleviated, core body temperature and mean skin temperature were not affected (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107" class="xref">2015b</xref>). In very hot environments, the cooling effect of the fans in these garments is gradually approaching its limit (Jay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48" class="xref">2015</xref>). Thus, other cooling methods are warranted (e.g. a cooling vest with phase change material), particularly when the humidity is also high, and/or when the clothing is impermeable (Gao et al.
