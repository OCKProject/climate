<p id="Par57" class="p">Ice is the most common phase change material. The latent heat of ice (335Â kJ/kg) is higher than those of other types of PCMs, therefore the cooling rate is high (Gao

Ice can be used in occupational settings with extremely hot environments with very high physical work and exercise intensity (i.e. overwhelming heat stress) to alleviate heat strain, increase performance and improve survivability (Smolander et al.
