<p id="Par40" class="p">This website is still under development and eventually new applications that take account of heat exposures outdoors in the sun and the impacts of different clothing will be included. Monthly climate condition and heat data since 1980 are included for local areas (in 67,000 grid cells over land). In addition, data from specific weather stations (more than 18,000) for daily heat analysis can be accessed via the Hothaps-Soft database and software (

This data can be used by local enterprises, government departments, community organizations, schools and other interested parties to assess heat stress risks in their own locality.
