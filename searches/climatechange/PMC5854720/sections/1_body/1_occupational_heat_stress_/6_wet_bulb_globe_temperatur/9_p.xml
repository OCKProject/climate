<p id="Par23" class="p">Solar radiation is not always directly measured and included in standard meteorological data. To accurately measure mean radiant temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">mrt</sub>) requires measurements of short- and long-wave radiation, diffuse and reflected radiation from six directions using pyranometer and pyrgeometers (Matzarakis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73" class="xref">2007</xref>; Schreier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, not only T
 <sub class="sub">mrt</sub> but also T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub>, T
 <sub class="sub">nw</sub> can be indirectly estimated using various models based weather station data, geographical locations, time of the day, day of the year, etc. (Matzarakis et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57" class="xref">2014</xref>). Estimates from a number of Asian cities (Kjellstrom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" class="xref">2013</xref>) show that generally the afternoon WBGT values in the sun are 2–3 °C higher than the values in the shade. Another limitation that applies to all heat stress index estimates based on weather station data is that specific workplace conditions and urban environments can be significantly different from conditions at the nearby meteorological station (e.g. air velocity measured at 10-m height is different compared to that at the workplaces and in urban environments). These limitations caused by spatial differentiation and local heat sources (e.g. a smelter) when using meteorological data to estimate workplace WBGT are further reiterated by Spector and Sheffield (
