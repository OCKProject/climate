<p id="Par15" class="p">WBGT is among the most widely used occupational heat stress indices across the world (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" class="xref">2014</xref>; Havenith and Fiala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2016</xref>) and its inclusion in international (ISO 7243) and national (ACGIH 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" class="xref">2009</xref>) standards indicates that it has been widely accepted since it was developed in the 1950s by the US Army (Yaglou and Minard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101" class="xref">1957</xref>). The WBGT index can function as a screening tool for the assessment of heat stress (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>; Epstein and Moran 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2006</xref>). It applies to the evaluation of the mean effect of heat on humans during an eight-hour work day and during an hourly work period in determining work rest cycles, and the WBGT reference values do not apply to the evaluation of heat stress suffered during very short periods (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>). WBGT can be measured in hot environments with and without solar radiation. According to the standard specifications (ISO 7243), certain types of measurement devices (e.g. a 150 mm black globe) should be used (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>; Havenith and Fiala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, these devices were made in the 1950s so some improvements should be considered, e.g. allowing quicker response time (Johansson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2017</xref>, in this issue). A revision of the standard (ISO 7243) has been in process for more than 5 years, and it is not clear whether the measurement devices will be updated. Several mathematical methods to calculate WBGT from weather station data have been published (Blazejczyk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" class="xref">2012</xref>; Lemke and Kjellstrom 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>) and are of value for the assessment of climate change impact, particularly when there is lack of the standard measurement devices and lack of first-hand data measured in workplaces.
