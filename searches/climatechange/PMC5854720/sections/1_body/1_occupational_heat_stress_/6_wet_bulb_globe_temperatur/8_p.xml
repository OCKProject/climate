 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>) aimed at identifying a valid method to calculate current and future heat stress in hot areas of the planet using weather station data. However, neither T
 <sub class="sub">nw</sub> nor T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> are directly measured in weather stations. Based on the analysis and comparative measurements of a number of available methods, Lemke and Kjellstrom (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61" class="xref">2012</xref>) recommended the method of Liljegren et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62" class="xref">2008</xref>) for calculating outdoor WBGT in the sun and the method by Bernard and Pourmoghani (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5" class="xref">1999</xref>) for indoor or in full shade WBGT when estimating climate change impacts on heat stress at a population level. WBGT (T
 <sub class="sub">g</sub> and T
 <sub class="sub">nw</sub>) estimated based on a simplified equation using meteorological parameters was compared with Universal Thermal Climate Index - UTCI (Błażejczyk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" class="xref">2014</xref>). The results showed that the correlation was weak (Blazejczyk et al.
