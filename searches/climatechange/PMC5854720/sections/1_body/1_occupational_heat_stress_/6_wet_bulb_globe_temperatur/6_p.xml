<p id="Par20" class="p">An important advantage with WBGT as an occupational heat stress index in climate change impact assessments, is the availability of a small number of occupational epidemiology studies of heat stress on work capacity loss that was assessed and associated with WBGT levels (Wyndham

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" class="xref">2013</xref>). In spite of the availability of a large number of heat stress indices for many decades, practical field studies quantifying the relationship between heat stress indices and occupational illnesses/injuries are lacking. Most of the studies were purely descriptive and used air temperature as the only heat stress parameter (Xiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100" class="xref">2014</xref>; Havenith and Fiala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2016</xref>). Furthermore, many epidemiological studies failed to include and report on other relevant factors for human heat exchange with the environment, such as metabolic rate and clothing.
