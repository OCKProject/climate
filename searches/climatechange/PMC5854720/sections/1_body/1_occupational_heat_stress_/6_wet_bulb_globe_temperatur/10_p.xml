<p id="Par24" class="p">Current WBGT index reference values (ISO 7243) have considered physical activity and acclimatization. But the values can only apply to standard clothing (thermal insulation 0.6 clo, cotton and permeable) and various protective clothing options need to be considered. In addition, there is the specific sensitivity of a vulnerable workforce, e.g. older workers. A correction factor for different protective clothing properties is being considered in the revision of the standard based on related research (Bernard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" class="xref">2007</xref>; Ashley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" class="xref">2008</xref>). The working group responsible for developing the standard (ISO TC 159 SC5 WG1) has undertaken a review and a revision of the standard is ongoing. Parsons (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>) emphasized that the WBGT index will play a major role in monitoring occupational heat stress in the future. With climate change, occupational heat stress assessment using WBGT will be an important first line of defence in the avoidance of heat casualties (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>), although the WBGT is limited in its applicability across a broad range of climatic scenarios due to the inconvenience of measuring T
