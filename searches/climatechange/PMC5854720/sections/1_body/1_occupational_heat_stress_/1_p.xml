<p id="Par5" class="p">A comprehensive register of 162 human thermal climate indices has been recently assembled and categorized into eight classes by de Freitas and Grigorieva (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" class="xref">2015</xref>). The development of a heat stress index as “a single value that integrates the effects of the basic parameters in any human thermal environment such that its value will vary with the thermal strain experienced by the individual” (Epstein and Moran 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2006</xref>) has been fraught with difficulties. A number of scientists have approached the issue in different ways. Epstein and Moran (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2006</xref>) summarized 46 indices that have been published since Haldane (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">1905</xref>) proposed the “Wet-bulb Temperature” more than 100 years ago. This single parameter is still used in climate change impact research. Sherwood and Huber (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85" class="xref">2010</xref>) and Pal and Eltahir (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74" class="xref">2015</xref>) used wet bulb temperature (psychrometric) T
 <sub class="sub">w</sub> measured in well ventilated conditions for the assessment of survivability of humans due to heat stress in hot climates. Based on physics and heat transfer theory, but without any physiological considerations, a psychrometric wet bulb temperature of 35 °C was considered a limit for survival, when only resting metabolic heat production was taken into consideration. Clothing and solar heat radiation were not considered for this evaluation.
