<p id="Par31" class="p">The assessment of the thermo-physiological effects of the atmospheric environment is one of the key issues in human biometeorology (Jendritzky et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49" class="xref">2012</xref>). The UTCI provides an automated approach to incorporate complex physiological models of the thermo-physiological responses to outdoor thermal climate, but is limited in its assessment to standard conditions with a fixed moderate metabolic rate (135 W/m
 <sup class="sup">2</sup>, walking at 4 km/h on the level) and with typical clothing for urban populations that is incorporated and modelled based on actual observations from human clothing behaviour in urban environment conditions (Lindner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64" class="xref">2010</xref>). Within the air temperature range approximately between −20 to +30 °C, the observed basic clothing insulation varies with ambient air temperature and most probably changes also with the exposure time planned by the residents in urban environments, and their physical activity levels (Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>). Most likely the exposure time in those observations is shorter than a work shift. The clothing insulation is corrected for wind and body movement (Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>; Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" class="xref">1999</xref>; Parsons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" class="xref">1999</xref>). It was proposed that the clothing insulation should be in the range of 2.6 to 0.5 clo (Richards and Havenith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" class="xref">2007</xref>). The clothing model (in general, clothing insulation decreases with the increase of air temperature) incorporated into the UTCI is summed from local insulation values as a function of the ambient temperature in the study by Havenith et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>). On the warm side at air temperature (T
 <sub class="sub">a</sub>) about 32 to 40 °C, the basic leisure clothing insulation (I
 <sub class="sub">cl</sub>) is modelled to be relatively constant at about 0.3 clo. The number of the observed clothing insulation data over ambient temperatures of higher than 30 °C is limited (Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>). Furthermore, the clothing behaviour of urban residents in warm and hot environments does not always apply to occupational settings where workers wear special clothing for safety and protection.
