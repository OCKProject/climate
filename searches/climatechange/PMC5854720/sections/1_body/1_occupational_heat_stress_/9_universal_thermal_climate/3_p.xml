<p id="Par32" class="p">In workplaces and in the context of global warming, the criteria of air temperatures for hot weather warnings in most of the countries are higher than 30 °C (Havenith and Fiala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2016</xref>) and the insulation of work or protective clothing in occupational settings is usually higher than 0.5 clo. Consequently, occupational heat stress is likely underestimated by the UTCI. This aspect is a further limitation of the UTCI when applied to the assessment of occupational heat stress and heat strain for an eight-hour shift in workplaces when facing heat waves. A calculation tool for UTCI is available on the website (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://utci.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://utci.org/</ext-link>) based on a simplified version of the model of human thermoregulation. Although UCTI is based on an advanced and complex model, it is more confined to the assessment of the outdoor thermal environment in biometeorological applications (Havenith and Fiala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" class="xref">2016</xref>). A recent attempt has been made to extend the application of the UTCI to varying activity levels and exposure durations (Bröde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>). However, the UTCI and its incorporated clothing model suffers similar limitations as WBGT and PHS models for the assessment of heat stress when wearing protective clothing, therefore, it needs further improvements to assess and predict occupational heat stress of workers wearing protective clothing in hot environments (Havenith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37" class="xref">2012</xref>; Bröde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" class="xref">2016</xref>).
