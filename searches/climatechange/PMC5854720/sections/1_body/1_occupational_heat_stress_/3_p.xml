<p id="Par7" class="p">There are several dimensions to the evaluation of heat stress, which are not always clearly described in the background to different indices. These include:
 <list list-type="order" class="list">
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par8" class="p">the difference between 
    <bold class="bold">occupational (working people) and general population heat stress</bold> evaluation: workplaces have special features that may increase heat exposure, and working people including people who are doing exercises and leisure activities often have a higher metabolic rate than people who are not working, which influences the heat stress;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par9" class="p">
    <bold class="bold">individual assessments vs population based assessments</bold>: a focus on a population rather than on individuals demands assumptions to be made about population characteristics (e.g. age, gender, body weight and height, variability, vulnerability, acclimatization), workplace clothing and activities (e.g. metabolic rate);
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par10" class="p">underlying 
    <bold class="bold">evaluation principles of heat stress</bold>: rational indices based on physics (heat transfer and heat balance), empirical indices based on objective and subjective heat strain: thermal physiological responses (e.g. core body and skin temperatures, sweat rate, dehydration) or psychological responses (perceived thermal sensation and comfort) and related physical and cognitive performance (productivity) reduction; direct indices based on direct measurements of environmental variables.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par11" class="p">assessments of 
    <bold class="bold">current heat stress or estimates of future heat stress</bold>: climate change impact assessments deal with future levels and therefore calculations need some assumptions about local environment characteristics, protective clothing and work intensity to estimate workplace heat stress levels. In addition, the heat stress index needs to be reasonably accurate up to the heat levels that may occur in the future;
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item class="list-item">
   <p id="Par12" class="p">the difference between the 
    <bold class="bold">calculated index value and the limit value</bold> in the standards and guidelines: a calculated heat stress index may be a meaningful indicator of potential heat impacts, but standards that limit work activities and/or exposure time, are also influenced by the properties of clothing and work intensity; individual authorities can set different heat exposure limits.
