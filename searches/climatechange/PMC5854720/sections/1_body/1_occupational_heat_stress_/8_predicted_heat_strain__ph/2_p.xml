<p id="Par29" class="p">Currently the PHS method may be considered the most developed analytical method for predicting potential health problems for individuals due to work in the heat (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>). However, the clothing insulation in the PHS model is limited to 1.0 clo. Neither the WBGT nor the PHS methods are valid for the assessment of rapidly changing environments and short exposure durations (Parsons 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>). The validity of the PHS model and possible integration with meteorological data in the context of climate change need further development and evaluation. Some limitations of the PHS model, when dealing with protective clothing (insulation and evaporative resistance) used in hot environments, can be found in recent studies (Wang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">2015</xref>). In spite of the criticisms, the model is a useful tool for heat strain estimation (Kampmann et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" class="xref">2013</xref>; Kuklane et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60" class="xref">2015</xref>; Lundgren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68" class="xref">2014</xref>). Calculations are available in the standard (ISO 7933) and on the website, e.g.

However, any web based calculation tools, if not directly promoted by related standard, should be used with caution.
