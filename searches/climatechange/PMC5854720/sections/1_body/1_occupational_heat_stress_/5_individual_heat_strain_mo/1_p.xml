<p id="Par14" class="p">For the most detailed monitoring of individual thermal physiological responses to heat, personal measurements of core body (usually rectal) and skin temperatures, body mass loss (dehydration) due to sweating and heart rate can be carried out (ISO 9886: 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" class="xref">2004</xref>). Furthermore, the measurement or estimation of oxygen uptake (VO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>) quantifies aerobic workload and metabolic heat production of the whole body (ISO 8996: 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" class="xref">2004</xref>). The rating of perceived thermal sensation and thermal comfort (ISO 10551: 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" class="xref">1995</xref>; ISO 7730: 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43" class="xref">2005</xref>), and perceived physical exertion (Borg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" class="xref">1982</xref>), can complement the key quantitative measurements. Individual heat strain monitoring can detect early thermal physiological and psychological responses in vulnerable workers, (e.g. un-acclimatized, untrained, frail, ageing workers and workers with chronic diseases and disabilities), accordingly to provide timely and targeted personal protection and health care when confronted with heat waves (Parsons

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104" class="xref">2013a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105" class="xref">b</xref>). Due to biological variability it is not easy to accurately predict the response of any particular individual to climatic extremes. Therefore, it is necessary to provide appropriate medical supervision for individuals prior to and during severe heat stress exposures (ISO 12894: 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41" class="xref">2001</xref>).
