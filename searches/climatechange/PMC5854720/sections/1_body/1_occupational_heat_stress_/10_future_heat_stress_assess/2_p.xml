<p id="Par34" class="p">Future heat stress assessment tools in the context of climate change should be valid in high-risk climate zones, interpretable and translatable, acceptable and accessible. The assessment should be linked to recommendations of flexible and hierarchical control measures by taking vulnerabilities into consideration (Spector and Sheffield 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89" class="xref">2014</xref>). It should be based on solid thermal physiological and physical basis for both hot dry and hot humid environment conditions (Fiala and Havenith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" class="xref">2015</xref>) and allow for a wide range of clothing adjustments including protective clothing. Epstein and Moran (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" class="xref">2006</xref>) emphasized that an applicable heat stress index must meet the following criteria: 1) feasible and accurate at relevant range of environmental and metabolic conditions, 2) considers all six factors, 3) the measurement should reflect workerâ€™s exposure, 4) exposure limits should be reflected by physiological and/or psychological responses. We can add that occupational heat stress indices should also make clear links to the practical consequences for the work activities, including productivity loss and economic impacts (Kjellstrom
