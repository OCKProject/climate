 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75" class="xref">2013</xref>). For the assessment of occupational heat stress, the following factors needs to be taken into consideration: 1) in addition to weather data, local workplace conditions that can be altered by local heating and cooling (e.g. use of furnace and air-condoning in industries), the design and materials of buildings, shade in outdoor environments (Johansson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50" class="xref">2017</xref>; Yahia et al. in press), etc. Local climate in urban environments (e.g. urban heat island effect) is influenced by urban forms, buildings, street canyons, plants, etc., therefore the microclimate in urban environments should be directly measured or predicted, e.g. using ENVI-met model (Taleghani et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91" class="xref">2015</xref>) and other methods (de Dear and Brager 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" class="xref">1998</xref>; Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103" class="xref">2014</xref>; Vuckovic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94" class="xref">2016</xref>) based on meteorological data, 2) special work and protective clothing rather than ordinary clothing worn by the general population, 3) physical work intensity. These three factors usually create more heat stress in occupational groups than in the general population and lead to underestimation of heat stress using currently available heat stress indices. Thus, there is a need for suitable heat stress indices, methods and/or standards to account for the above three workplace and individual factors for reasonable occupational heat stress assessment using routine meteorological data.
