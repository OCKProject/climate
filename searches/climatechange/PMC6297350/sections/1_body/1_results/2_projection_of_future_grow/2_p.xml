<p id="Par15" class="p">We used CMIP5 projections of future decadal averages of these two climate variables to project relative radial growth across the U.S. Southwest. A strong decline is projected based upon either tree-ring sample throughout the remainder of the twenty-first century. However, the magnitude of the projected growth decline differs substantially: by the end of the twenty-first century, the median of 15 different general circulation models projects an average growth rate decline of forest inventory trees of about 75% compared to the twentieth century mean, whereas the median projection for the targeted trees is below 0% (106% decrease). Thus, the projection based on forest inventory samples shows 29% less of a growth decline compared to the projection based on targeted samples (106–75 = 31; 31/106 = 29). Equivalently, we find a 41% stronger growth reduction when projection is based on the climate-sensitive trees of the ITRDB compared to the representative forest inventory sample (31/75 = 41; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). Replacing precipitation and mean maximum temperature with climatic water balance and vapor pressure deficit as predictors of tree growth increases the projected relative difference in growth decrease by just 1% (Supplementary Figure
