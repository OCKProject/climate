<p id="Par12" class="p">Considering just the forest inventory sample, all three species are similarly sensitive to warm season maximum temperatures. We found a stronger negative impact of antecedent fall temperature southward and eastward for Douglas-fir and ponderosa pine (

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 6127 and 4178, respectively) and stronger negative impacts of summer temperature on these two species eastward (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4c</xref>). All three species are strongly positively sensitive to winter precipitation, with a significant trend towards greater sensitivity in the south and east. Older trees are significantly more sensitive to all three climate parameters (Supplementary Figure
