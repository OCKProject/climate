<p id="Par9" class="p">Throughout the interior west, targeted samples of all three species show higher growth variability compared to nearby forest inventory samples (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3a</xref>). Mean growth variability (SD) of Douglas-fir is 9 ± 20% (mean ± standard deviation) higher in the ITRDB collection than in the FIA collection, with no evident geographic trend. Mean growth variability of common pinyon and ponderosa pine were 11 ± 18% and 14 ± 26% higher, respectively, in the ITRDB sample, and this difference was significantly greater in the south (interaction effect between database and latitude;

 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2648 and 4178, respectively). In addition, growth variability increased with decreasing elevation, from north to south, and west to east, i.e., all in the direction of increasing aridity

 </sup>, as well as with increasing tree age (Supplementary Figure
