<p id="Par11" class="p">Ring-width variation across the interior western U.S. is better explained by and is more responsive to climate variation in the great majority of targeted samples compared to nearby forest inventory samples (larger coefficient of determination and steeper regression slopes; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>). ITRDB ponderosa pine and common pinyon are significantly more negatively sensitive to antecedent fall temperatures compared to nearby forest inventory samples (average difference between regression coefficients: −0.02,
