<p id="Par10" class="p">We then compared climate sensitivity of the ITRDB vs. FIA collections, i.e., partial regression coefficients from multiple linear regressions explaining tree-level relative ring-width variation as a function of climate data. We used climate variables known to explain ring-width variation in the southwestern United States: mean monthly maximum temperature of the antecedent fall (August to October), current summer temperature (May to July), and cool-season precipitation (November to March)
