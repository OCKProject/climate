<p id="Par8" class="p">We assessed the growth variability of trees at each ITRDB sampling site over the 1930–1995 period, measured as the standard deviation (SD) of detrended ring-width time series, and compared this against growth variability (SD) of all FIA tree-ring time series of the same species within a search radius of 100 km. Less variability indicates more stable growth—i.e., a weaker response to temporally variable environmental conditions (macroclimatic variation)
