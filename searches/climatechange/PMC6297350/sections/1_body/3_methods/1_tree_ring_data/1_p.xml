<p id="Par22" class="p">We focused our analysis on the three species of the interior western U.S. most well-represented in publicly available tree-ring archives (the International Tree-Ring Data Base, ITRDB): 
 <italic class="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic> var. 
 <italic class="italic">glauca</italic> (Douglas-fir), 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</italic> (ponderosa pine), and 
 <italic class="italic">Pinus edulis</italic> (common pinyon). Our data consisted of two independent collections: (1) tree-ring time series downloaded from the ITRDB as of December 2016, and (2) tree-ring time series developed as part of the Interior West Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program, sampled in a gridded fashion over all forested areas
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup>. The latter collection was complemented by two additional inventory-style datasets from (a) the Pinaleño Mountains in southeastern Arizona, where sampling was performed in a systematic grid of 54 0.05-ha circular plots spaced 1 km apart
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" class="xref">34</xref>
 </sup>, and from (b) northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico, where a subset of forest inventory plots on the Navajo Nation was sampled along a climate gradient
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" class="xref">19</xref>
 </sup>.
