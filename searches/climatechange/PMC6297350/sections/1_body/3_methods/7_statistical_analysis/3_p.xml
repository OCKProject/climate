<p id="Par30" class="p">We compared these statistics—standard deviation, regression slopes, and coefficient of determination—by contrasting the median value of each across all ITRDB time series at a given sampling site against the median value across all FIA time series within a radius of 100 km of the focal ITRDB site (ITRDB minus FIA). Thus, the comparison is geographically local. Significance of these contrasts was tested using a bootstrapped two-sided Wilcoxon test (1000 iterations) to control for differences in the number of time series between the ITRDB vs. FIA collections. We discarded those ITRDB locations with less than ten FIA samples of the same species within a radius of 100 km. Using climatic water balance (precipitation minus potential evapotranspiration) instead of precipitation and water vapor pressure deficit instead of mean maximum temperature on a subset of the data did not alter the conclusions presented herein.</p>
