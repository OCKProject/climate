<p id="Par28" class="p">Because tree size and forest stand information is not available on the ITRDB, we were constrained to analyze tree growth in relative terms. That is, raw ring widths were detrended prior to analysis, controlling for the ontogenetic trend of decreasing radial growth with increasing bole diameter, as well as possible effects of stand dynamics. The dependent variable is thus tree growth in a given year relative to an expected value, following one of several possible detrending methods. Results presented in the main manuscript are based on ratio-detrended ring-width time series using a modified negative exponential curve (substituted by straight line if a curve yielded a poor fit to raw data). Results from two alternative methods of detrending, i.e., spline-detrending with a 50% frequency-cutoff at 30 and 100 years—with and without prewhitening, i.e., the removal of temporal autocorrelation by fitting an autoregressive (AR) or autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model to the original time series—can be found in the supplementary material (Supplementary Figures
