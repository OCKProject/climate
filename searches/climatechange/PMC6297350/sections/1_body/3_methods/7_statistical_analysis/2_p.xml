<p id="Par29" class="p">We refrained from performing analyses at the site level, because the number of trees sampled per FIA plot is low (usually 1–2). Instead, we took a tree-level approach, comparing geographically specific distributions of values

 </sup>. We used 1930–1995 as the period of analysis, because 1995 is the most common last year in the FIA core collection, at which time median FIA tree age is ~80 years. Ring-width time series that had less than 30 years of overlap with this window were excluded from analysis. Standard deviation was calculated for each detrended time series. Using multiple linear regression, ring-width index of each time series was predicted as a function of total cool season precipitation (previous November to current year March), mean maximum temperatures in fall of the previous year (August to October), and summer of the current year (May to July) to obtain estimates of the sensitivity of relative growth to these three climate variables (i.e., regression slopes,
