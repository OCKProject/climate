 </sup> gridded historical monthly data, downscaled and interpolated to adjust the mean and variance of the original CRU time series to elevation- and location-specific values. Future climate projections were taken from 15 Atmosphere-Ocean General Circulation Models of the CMIP5 multimodel dataset, i.e., the IPCC Assessment Report 5 (2013). We focus on climate normals for the 2010–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099 periods under emission scenario RCP8.5, an extra 8.5 W m
