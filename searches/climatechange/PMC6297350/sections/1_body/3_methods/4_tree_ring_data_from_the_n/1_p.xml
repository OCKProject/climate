<p id="Par25" class="p">Tree-ring collections from the Navajo Nation in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico were sampled within a systematic grid of 272 continuous forest inventory (CFI) plots installed between 1974 and 2005 monitored jointly by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and Navajo Forestry Department. This plot grid encompasses ~250,000 ha of largely ponderosa pine-dominated forest, with areas of piñon-juniper and dry mixed-conifer. Each CFI plot consists of three 0.1 ha circular subplots. As described in ref.

 </sup> and elevation. At each plot, 5–15 trees of one to three target species (ponderosa pine, Douglas-fir, or common pinyon) were cored perpendicular to slope at 20–50 cm above ground level. We included 469 trees (908 samples) from 33 plots with ponderosa pine, 13 plots with Douglas-fir, and 11 plots with common pinyon.
