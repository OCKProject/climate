 </sup>, after discarding the ITRDB locations with less than 10 FIA samples of the same species within a radius of 100 km. We then averaged all ITRDB time series into a regional chronology by applying a geographically weighted mean, which takes into account the mean distance of each site to all other sites, giving more weight to samples from areas with few chronologies. Geographic weighting was calculated and applied in each year to account for varying site replication over time, and the resulting regional chronology was variance-stabilized

 </sup>. FIA time series, 2923 of which (out of a total of 2926) fall within at least one 100 km radius around an ITRDB site, were treated following the same procedure. The variance of regional-scale average climate time series was not adjusted. To ensure sufficient sample replication in the most recent years, the analysis included the 1902–2008 period. Specifically, the regional aggregations were based on 208 ITRDB sites (8305 samples) with 40 sites (1282 samples) present in the year 2008, and 1247 FIA sites (2926 samples) with 86 sites (1025 samples) present in 2008.
