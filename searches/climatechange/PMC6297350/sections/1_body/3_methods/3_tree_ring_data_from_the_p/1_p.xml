<p id="Par24" class="p">The Pinaleño Mountains in southeastern Arizona are the tallest of the Madrean Sky Island ranges, spanning a vertical gradient of more than 2100 m, from Chihuahuan mixed-desert shrubland at 1150 m to spruce-fir forest up to 3268 m. Tree demographic and fire history information across the landscape was collected on a systematic grid of 54 0.05-ha circular plots spaced 1 km apart, established between 2006 and 2009 (c.f. Figure 2 in ref.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>
 </sup>). Increment cores were collected from all trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 19.5 cm throughout each plot, and from trees between one and 19.4 cm DBH on a nested sub-plot equal to one third the area of the full plot (0.017 ha).
