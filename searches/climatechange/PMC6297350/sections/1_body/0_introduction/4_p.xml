<p id="Par6" class="p">In this study we analyze and quantify the consequences of targeted sampling of old trees on marginal sites by comparing ITRDB chronologies from the U.S. Interior West against systematically sampled tree-ring collections. Currently the most extensive systematically sampled tree-ring collection in the region, the U.S. Forest Service Interior West-Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA)
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" class="xref">17</xref>
 </sup> dataset includes 4655 trees from permanent forest inventory plots. The FIA plot network is designed to representatively sample all forested lands of the U.S., with one plot per 2428 ha, resulting in a dataset that is, to a large degree, spatially and ecologically unbiased
