<p id="Par7" class="p">We analyze ring-width time series from forest inventory vs. targeted (ITRDB) samples, evaluating the expectation that both ring-width variability and climate sensitivity are higher in the targeted sample. Our analyses focus on some of the most widespread, important, and densely sampled tree species in the Interior West—Douglas-fir (

 <italic class="italic">glauca</italic>, PSME), ponderosa pine (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</italic>, PIPO) and common pinyon (
 <italic class="italic">Pinus edulis</italic>, PIED). We investigate possible explanations for differences in year-to-year ring-width variability between the two samples, with age, macro-site, and micro-site selection as alternative (but not mutually exclusive) hypotheses (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Finally, we demonstrate how much future tree growth projections across the southwestern U.S. differ when based upon targeted, old trees vs. the representative, inventory samples. That is, we address the following three questions: (1) Do targeted vs. forest inventory tree-ring collections differ in growth variability and climate sensitivity? (2) What factors explain the differences? (3) What are the implications for projection of future forest growth in response to climate-related stress?
