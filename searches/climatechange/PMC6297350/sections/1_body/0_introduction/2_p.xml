Across the southwestern U.S., a tree-ring-derived “forest drought stress index”, which correlates well with tree mortality, bark-beetle outbreaks, fire, and remotely sensed productivity, has been projected to be more severe by the 2050s than the most severe 6-year drought conditions of the last 1000 years
