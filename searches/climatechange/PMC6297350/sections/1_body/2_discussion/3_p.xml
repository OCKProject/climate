<p id="Par18" class="p">There was clear agreement between the FIA and ITRDB chronologies that the expected net effect of climate change on tree growth is strongly negative (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>). But by quantifying the bias of the ITRDB towards climate-sensitive trees, we can put projected forest growth decrease based upon ITRDB samples

 </sup> in context—an unbiased context that suggests a considerable upward correction (29% in our model) for southwestern U.S. forests. The marginal conditions under which ITRDB samples have been collected represent a very small fraction of the distribution of forest conditions across the U.S. Southwest. The projection of negative growth in the future for this subset of trees suggests that mortality may occur at range margins, consistent with the prediction of range retractions made by climate envelope or species distribution models

 </sup>. However, heterogeneity in the strength of tree growth response to climate variation, and how that heterogeneity is arranged on landscapes, suggests reduced landscape-scale vulnerability of tree growth to drought stress. Decreased growth variability, in turn, has been linked to lower risk of tree mortality
