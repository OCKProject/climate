<p id="Par19" class="p">Though we have been able to compare projections of future US Southwestern tree growth with respect to the climate-sensitive nature of the ITRDB sample, there remain important caveats associated with our analysis. The first analytical step—detrending—is intended to remove the long-term trend of decreasing ring-width with increasing bole diameter that is imposed by geometry. However, this procedure also removes environmental signals that vary on time scales longer than decadal to multi-decadal, including climate trends, possible increasing water use efficiency associated with CO

Because we neither model these drivers explicitly nor model absolute growth rates, we cannot parse their effects or investigate how they will interact to determine future tree growth. Further, our model only accounts for linear responses of tree growth to climate, i.e., it assumes stationarity of responses, when it is likely that trees’ climate-growth responses will change as they experience increasingly unusual climatic conditions, changing phenology, and extreme events. True growth responses to climate are also likely to deviate from our statistical predictions in the face of no-analog combinations of climate variables, including beyond temperature and precipitation, novel covariance structure of the array of plant-relevant environmental variables that influence evapotranspiration. For all these reasons, we draw attention to the difference between projections, caused by biased sampling (poor representation of elevation, age structure, and micro-site conditions). Finally, we point out that our projection does not account for increased vulnerability to insect attack and increased risk of fire, which both have the potential to strongly and suddenly change the carbon source vs. sink balance of forests.
