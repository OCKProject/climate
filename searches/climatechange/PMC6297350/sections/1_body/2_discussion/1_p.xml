<p id="Par16" class="p">Large-scale inference based upon tree-ring time series sampled from old, targeted trees overestimates the impact of climate change, especially on southwestern U.S. forest growth. This is not a surprise—it has been known for half a century that trees at the arid edge of the forest biome are more sensitive to climate variation—i.e., their growth correlates more strongly with climate and varies from year to year more strongly

 </sup>. This observation, made by one of the founding fathers of dendrochronology (H.C. Fritts), has been the basis for targeted sampling by dendroclimatologists for decades. That our tree-by-tree analysis revealed significant differences between ITRDB and FIA samples in the variance explained by climatic parameters verifies that the practice of targeting open-grown trees occurring under ecologically marginal conditions, in order to maximize climate signal with a few samples, achieved that goal.
