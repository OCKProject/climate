<p id="Par17" class="p">We found evidence in support of three hypotheses for the observed differences in growth variability and climate sensitivity between the FIA and ITRDB collections: First, Douglas-fir ITRDB sites in the U.S. Southwest are located at noticeably lower elevation than the representative FIA collection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1a</xref>), reflecting a tendency to target sites that are marginal with respect to its elevation distribution, which we term the “macro-site selection bias”. Second, across all three species, there is a striking age difference between the two samples, with the average cumulative ring count of FIA time series 77 years compared to 274 years for ITRDB time series (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>). Age is a significant predictor of radial growth variability and climate sensitivity (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">3</xref>). Age- or size-related differences in climate sensitivity have been reported in several studies, and have been attributed, among other factors, to differences in water and nutrient translocation mechanisms between young (small) and old (large) individuals

 </sup>. Third, in the case of ponderosa pine and common pinyon, growth variability (SD) of ITRDB time series is significantly greater than growth variability of the forest inventory time series, even after controlling for elevation, age, latitude, longitude, climate normals, and two-way interactions between these factors (Supplementary Figure 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" class="xref">1</xref>). We hypothesize this is caused by targeted sampling of trees found on steep, rocky slopes with less soil water capacity (as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1b</xref>, and Fritts et al.

 </sup>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref>), which we refer to as the “micro-site selection bias”. Indeed, dendrochronologists have long paid attention to fine-scale site characteristics like landscape position, aspect, slope, and soil depth that affect ecohydrological and micrometeorological characteristics (runoff, radiation, snow responses, wind, and humidity), driving inter-annual variability in ring widths, which are not captured by coarse-scale climate predictors.
