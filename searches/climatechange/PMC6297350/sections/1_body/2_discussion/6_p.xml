<p id="Par21" class="p">The ITRDB is a treasure trove for records of tree growth variability, both in space and time. However, in order to answer broad-scale ecological questions, and improve our understanding of forest vulnerability to climate change across forest biomes, dendrochronological sampling designs must be more representativeâ€”not just within a site
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" class="xref">29</xref>
 </sup>, but also spatially by covering an ecological gradient
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" class="xref">30</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" class="xref">31</xref>
 </sup> or with a systematic grid
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" class="xref">20</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" class="xref">32</xref>
 </sup>. We are optimistic that the establishment of a new data standard on the ITRDB (TRiDaS
 <sup class="sup">
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" class="xref">33</xref>
 </sup>) that allows additional information about sites (slope, aspect, stand density, soil depth, etc.) and trees (diameter, height, pith offset, etc.) to be readily shared will improve the value and versatility of publicly available data for ecological forecasts of forested ecosystems. Such metadata will enable explicit modeling of the many influences on tree growth, help to close the scaling gap between gridded climate products and the growth conditions experienced by individual trees, and ultimately lead to better estimates of the sensitivity of forest ecosystem productivity to changes in climate.
