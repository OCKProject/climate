<p id="Par20" class="p">A remaining question is whether a similar systematic climate sensitivity bias exists in tree-ring networks in other parts of the world and, if so, at what magnitude. On the one hand, the potential for bias may be greatest at the arid edge of the forest biome, and the problem may be limited to certain places, like the southwestern United States. Supporting this, Klesse et al.

 </sup> found no significant difference, between targeted (ITRDB) and nontargeted samples, in the sensitivity of tree growth to May−August temperatures in more mesic forests of Central and Northern Europe. On the other hand, we see an indication of positive summer temperature sensitivity bias in ITRDB Douglas-fir samples in the northern Rockies, so there seems to be the potential for other kinds of bias in other regions. Absent information regarding the original purpose of the sampling, we advise caution when using ITRDB chronologies. For example, the environmental space sampled by ITRDB collections (e.g., mean annual temperature and precipitation, elevation) should be compared against the distribution of environmental conditions of the forested study area of interest, to evaluate how representative (at the macro-site scale) those sites might be—keeping in mind that micro-site and age biases are likely to be present as well.
