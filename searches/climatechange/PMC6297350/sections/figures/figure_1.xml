  <p class="p">The site and tree selection principles of dendrochronology. The majority of tree-ring time series in the International Tree-Ring Data Bank (ITRDB) were sampled to maximize chronology length and climate sensitivity. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Comparison of the elevation at which three important species (PIED = 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus edulis</italic>, PIPO = 
   <italic class="italic">Pinus ponderosa</italic>, PSME = 
   <italic class="italic">Pseudotsuga menziesii</italic>) were sampled in Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. A bias towards sampling low-elevation sites (therefore, warmer and drier) is evident for ITRDB samples of PSME compared to the representative inventory (Forest Inventory and Analysis; FIA) dataset, leading to a “macro-site selection bias”. 
   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Selection of trees on steep, rocky slopes with little soil water holding capacity leads to greater ring-width variability (modified from Fritts

   </sup>). We hypothesize that this sampling practice—the “micro-site selection bias”—explains higher standard deviation of ring-width index in the ITRDB collection (Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>), even after accounting for elevation, age, and other factors. Vertical bars show the age distribution of the two collections in 1995. Tick marks indicate the median in each density strip
