  <p class="p">Comparisons of growth variability in ITRDB vs. FIA (targeted vs. representative forest inventory) time series. 
   <bold class="bold">a</bold> Distribution of the standard deviation (SD) of ring-width index (RWI) time series of the three focal species, with FIA vs. ITRDB data in left vs. right density strips, respectively. Species abbreviations (PSME, PIPO, and PIED) follow Fig.

   <bold class="bold">b</bold> Difference between the median SD of ITRDB vs. surrounding FIA time series (ITRDB median SD minus FIA median SD). Contrasts are filled blue if the median ITRDB SD is significantly greater than the median FIA SD; red if the difference is significantly negative (
