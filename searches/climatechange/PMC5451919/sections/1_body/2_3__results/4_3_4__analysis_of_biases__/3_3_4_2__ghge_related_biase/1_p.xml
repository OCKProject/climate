<p class="p">For active transport articles, the average GHGE rubric scores for increased public transport articles (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2) was 3.5/5. For Low Emissions Vehicles articles (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) it was 3.25/5 and for active transport only articles (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 4) it was 4/5. Articles that only considered active transport had better GHGE scores as GHGE were reduced more drastically than in scenarios where public transportation or low emissions vehicles were allowed to increase. For diet articles, the average GHGE rubric scores for articles where meat and animal product reduction was only considered (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 2) was 3.9/5, whereas articles where meat and animal product reduction was considered in conjunction with more general diet modifications (
 <italic class="italic">n</italic> = 12) it was 4.5/5. Diet articles that considered more than reducing consumption of meat and animal products had better GHGE scores as other high GHGE producing food groups were also reduced.
