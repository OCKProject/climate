 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t006" class="xref">Table 6</xref> shows the average health score and range of health scores for each health outcome. Morbidity was the least commonly used health outcome measure, while caloric, nutrient, and mortality outcomes were all used with similar frequency. Articles reporting mortality and morbidity had a higher health score than those reporting caloric and nutrient outcomes. Active transport articles only reported mortality and morbidity health outcomes. Diet articles reported some morbidity and mortality, but primarily reported caloric and nutrient health outcomes. Since some articles included multiple measures (i.e., mortality and morbidity), their health scores are reported in all relevant categories. For a summary of health outcomes included for each article, see
