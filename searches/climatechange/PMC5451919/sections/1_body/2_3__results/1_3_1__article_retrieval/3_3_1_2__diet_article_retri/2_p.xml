<p class="p">Of the 23 selected diet articles, seven were based on UK data, three were based on Swedish data, two each were based on Brazilian, French, Danish, and European data, and one each on New Zealand, Italian, Dutch, OCED, and Australian data. For health outcome measures, 18 articles evaluated intermediate determinates of health including consumption of cholesterol or saturated fats, nutrients and total calories. Several articles went further to estimate health outcomes directly. Five estimated changes in mortality or DALYs, and three evaluated the occurrence of specific diseases. All articles estimated changes to CO
