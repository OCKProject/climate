<p class="p">Diet articles included, with the exception of two, detailed estimates of their proposed GHGE reductions under various scenarios and therefore quantified reductions could be reported (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t002" class="xref">Table 2</xref>). Masset et al. [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">31</xref>] did not model scenarios or estimate a specific level of GHGE reduction, but compared estimates of GHGE for commonly consumed foods based on reported dietary intake (i.e., each food item was assigned an GHGE value (expressed in #gCO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub>eq/100 g) that was compared to the nutritional value of the item to obtain a sustainability score). Gonz√°lez et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">26</xref>] similarly did not report estimates for modeled scenarios, but rather compared the GHGE and nutritional value of different food items. Between articles, the scale of GHGE reduction varied with geography, population size and the scale of scenarios included. Variation in units and methods precluded any direct comparison between articles.
