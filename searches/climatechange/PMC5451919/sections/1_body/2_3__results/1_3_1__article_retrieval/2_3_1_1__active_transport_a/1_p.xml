<p class="p">The majority of active transport articles retrieved from the ScienceDirect search did not address greenhouse gas mitigation strategies related to active transport. For relevant articles, the full text was retrieved. Most were review articles or only examined one of the two outcomes of interest (i.e., active transport impacts on health or greenhouse gas emissions impacts on health, but not both). Five articles from the ScienceDirect search meet the inclusion criteria. Subsequent searches on PubMEd and Google Scholar returned two additional articles. A manual search based on articles cited in the selected literature added a further two articles. In total, literature searches produced nine articles, eight of which specifically addressed active transport, and one of which addressed both active transport and diet.</p>
