<p class="p">Of the nine selected active transport articles, two each were based on UK, U.S., and New Zealand data, and one each on Indian, Spanish, and Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) country data. For health outcome measures, two articles estimated the disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), another two articles evaluated monetized gains from reduced mortality or increased life expectancy, and four articles estimated all-cause mortality with or without evaluation of specific disease occurrences. One article correlated increased trends in sedentary behavior and meat consumption with obesity [

Identified health determinants of morbidity and mortality outcomes included increased activity, exposure to pollutants and traffic injuries. Most articles utilized the World health organizationâ€™s HEAT tool to estimate Metabolic Equivalents of Tasks (METs) associated with active transport. In addition to evaluating the health impact of increased activity, most articles also considered exposure to pollutants and traffic accidents under different transport scenarios. All included articles estimated GHGE using measured carbon dioxide (CO
