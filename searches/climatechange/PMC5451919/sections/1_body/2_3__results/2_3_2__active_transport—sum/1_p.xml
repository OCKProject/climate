<p class="p">All active transport articles considered scenarios where biking, walking or both replaced vehicular transport. In addition to active transport mitigation strategies, four articles included low emission vehicles in their transportation scenarios and two considered increased public transportation (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). A further two articles concluded that public transport would increase in their proposed healthier and lower emission transport scenarios, but did not calculate the impact. Evaluated health determinants for active transport articles are presented in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>. All active transport articles included physical activity as a health determinant in their analysis, whereas traffic injuries were less frequently evaluated (in 7/9 articles). All but one article considered air pollution as a health determinant.
