<p class="p">Increased physical activity, decreased sedentary time and healthy dietary choices are modifiable behaviors that can reduce morbidity and premature mortality as well as decrease GHGE when the necessary policies and infrastructure exist for sustainable choices. However, to date, lifestyle-related mitigation co-benefits appear to have received less consideration than other co-benefits strategies. Indeed, the IPCCâ€™s recent Summary for Policy Makers lacks any discussion of active transport and diet co-benefits review articles [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">2</xref>]. Though model based diet [
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">9</xref>] and active transport [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">10</xref>] co-benefits studies have separately been reviewed, to date both sets of literature have not been collectively examined. Given the interconnectedness of diet and exercise and their combined influence on health and the global burden of disease, an examination of the current literature with a particular focus on health outcome analysis is needed. Broad-scale implementation of policies to encourage these sustainable lifestyles, require a thorough review of the literature to identify the most effective strategies for obtaining health and climate change mitigation outcomes. Therefore, the aim of this review was to identify and summarize the existing research on lifestyle choices with the greatest potential to mitigate climate change while improving health. The information gained could aid individual decision-making, as well as the development of health, transportation, and environmental policy.
