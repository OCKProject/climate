<p class="p">It is difficult to draw clear conclusions from the current body of literature regarding the scale of GHGE reductions and health improvements from potential diet and active transport interventions. Outcomes presented in the reviewed articles are difficult to compare directly due to variations in the assumptions and measurement units. More attention needs to be given to developing realistic and relevant diet and transportation modifications strategies. To date, the most effective approach proposed in the literature is the combination of a Pigouvian tax for GHGE and a “sin” tax on unhealthy food items. A tax on GHGE alone will not necessarily result in a healthier diet. Meat consumption reduction strategies may be best suited to countries with excess consumption of meat and protein, while others may need to consider developing low GHGE meat production systems that can supply their nation with a healthy protein source.</p>
