<p class="p">For dietary interventions, the outcomes for health and GHGE are less certain. A more exhaustive list of LCAs for food items is needed in order to identify and promote low-GHGE meats and meat substitutes that best meet nutritional requirements. As far as achieving diet modification, the acceptability of taxation on high GHG emitting food will vary greatly between countries. In some countries this may provide an ideal mechanism for achieving a sustainable diet, though other strategies such as limiting meat production or placing restrictions on fats and sugars included in processed foods also have potential. Health outcome estimates could be improved with greater understanding of the effect of diet on morbidity and mortality.</p>
