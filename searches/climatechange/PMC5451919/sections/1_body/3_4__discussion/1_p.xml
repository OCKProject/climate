<p class="p">This is the first review to identify and summarize research on lifestyle choices that improve health and have the greatest potential to mitigate climate change. A meta-analysis comparing the co-benefits of lifestyle-related climate change mitigation strategies was not feasible due to: (1) the small number of articles found that quantified both GHGE and health impacts associated with lifestyle-related mitigation strategies; (2) the scale and range of lifestyle-related mitigation strategies examined within the literature, plus; (3) differences in model assumptions. However, following a structured review of the literature it seems that the scale of impact on health and GHGE outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Implications for both researchers and policymakers are discussed below.</p>
