<p class="p">Overall, achieving mitigation and health benefits from diet modifications requires an extensive understanding of diet and health interactions, cultural dietary traditions, plus GHGE for culturally/geographically relevant foods. Existing GHGE estimates for food items and production systems could be considered relatively narrow. Further database development of GHGE for food items and production systems would guide the development of sustainable diets (defined as: “…diets with low environmental impacts which contribute to food and nutrition security and to healthy life for present and future generations”) [

It is essential that future diet-related co-benefits research focuses on sustainable diets as such diets are protective and respectful of biodiversity and ecosystems; culturally acceptable; accessible; economically fair and affordable; nutritionally adequate; safe and healthy; plus optimize natural and human resources [
 <xref rid="B43-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">43</xref>]. If individuals and communities are to participate in diet-modifications it is imperative that a reasonable and cohesive diet recommendation is made. Such recommendations should clearly fit the definition of a sustainable diet. For the most part, dietary modifications in the reviewed articles were limited to alternations in meat consumption. Meat production is associated with high GHGE, and many people in OECD countries consume more meat and protein than dietary guidelines recommend. However, more comprehensive diet assessments and modifications can lead to sustainable diets with greater mitigation and health improvements if meat is substituted with the lowest emitting as well as the most nutritious and affordable foods.
