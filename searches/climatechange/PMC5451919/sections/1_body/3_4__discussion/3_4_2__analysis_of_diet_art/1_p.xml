<p class="p">The extent of emission reduction/increase for a diet scenario depended on the scale of the scenario and assumptions of the model. For example, the scenario used by Aston et al. [
 <xref rid="B19-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">19</xref>] doubled the number of vegetarians and had the remaining UK population reduce their meat consumption to volumes equivalent to the lowest quintet of current British meat eaters. Berners-Lee et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">20</xref>] were even more ambitious and modeled a total switch to vegetarianism and veganism in the UK. Thus, their estimated GHGE reductions was 27.8 Mt/year compared to 40 Mt/year, respectively. Reviewed diets that lowered GHGE were not universally better for health. Similarly, healthy diets were not necessarily low in GHGE. The linear programming models, as in Wilson et al. [
 <xref rid="B40-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">40</xref>] and Macdiarmid et al. [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>], were developed to select the diet that would optimize health and GHGE outcomes at the same time. However, not all diets generated via this method were considered feasible. Several constraints were needed to develop consumer friendly diets with these models, and such considerations resulted in reduced benefits. For example, a diet that met all nutritional requirements while reducing GHGE by 90% contained only seven foods, all in unrealistic quantities [
 <xref rid="B30-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">30</xref>]. When constraints were added, such as minimum intakes for fruits and vegetables, 52 different food groups were included, and GHGE were only reduced by 36% [
