<p class="p">On average, diet and active transport articles scored better on the GHGE section than on the health section of the biases, limitations, and uncertainties rubric, although this difference was negligible for active transport (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t005" class="xref">Table 5</xref>). This is likely because quantifying diet and exercise health outcomes is more challenging than quantifying changes in GHGE. Each reviewed article produced a GHGE estimate based, at least in part, on CO
 <sub class="sub">2</sub> equivalent emissions. Conversely, health outcomes in the dietary articles ranged from morbidity and mortality to intermediate determinants of health such as nutrient and calorie intake. In the majority of diet articles, health outcomes were associated with nutrient or calorie intake, whereby improved nutrient profiles or reduced calorie intake was associated with improved health outcomes; however, the exact impact of the diet modification on morbidity and mortality was not quantified. A few articles use previously published relative risks related to specific nutrient intake to estimate morbidity and mortality associated with proposed diet changes (

Subsequently, the uncertainty surrounding dietary health outcomes was greater than that for active transport and therefore active transport articles scored better in the health section of the rubric (
