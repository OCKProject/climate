<p class="p">A change in activity level or diet (the “exposure” referred to in point 2 above) will not have an immediate effect on health, and effects may change over time. Unintended outcomes must be considered when determining changes in health or GHGE following a diet or transportation modification. Macmillian et al. [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">14</xref>] included a system dynamics model to assess many of these potential feedback mechanisms: safety in numbers resulting from increased cyclists; change in vehicles speed due to reduced numbers; and perceived and actual risk of injury following transportation mode change and safety measures. It was generally assumed that accommodating infrastructure, such as cycle lanes, would lead to an increase in active transport. However, participation in active transport may replace other physical activities, leading to neutral or reduced net activity levels (e.g., a longer active transport commute may reduce time and energy for regular exercise regimes). Conversely, there was evidence that active transport was associated with generally higher physical activity levels, though the causative link in such an association is yet to be established [

With diet modification, reduction in meat consumption may lead to poor health outcomes if unhealthy foods replace meat in the diet. Well-designed and effective interventions require thorough analysis of these feedback mechanisms and system dynamics modeling could be a very useful tool.
