<p class="p">Quantifying GHGE across stages of food production and delivery (i.e., from the farm, to processing, to consumers) can be complex. Each stage provides a variable, but significant contribution to GHGE. Many of the GHGE estimates in the included articles relied on previously published databases of food groupâ€™s GHGE estimates, with varying degrees of generalization regarding the source and delivery point of food items. The challenging nature of tracking the GHGE impact for individual food items likely contributes to the focus on meat production in the included dietary articles. Meat is known to be a significant contributor to agricultural and food-related GHGE and is a significant source of dietary calories, protein, and fat. It has been estimated that up to 35% of GHGE come from agriculture and land use for livestock production [
