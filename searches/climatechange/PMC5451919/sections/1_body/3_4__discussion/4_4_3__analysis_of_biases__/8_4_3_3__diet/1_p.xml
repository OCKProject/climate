<p class="p">The majority of reviewed diet articles estimated GHGE using lifecycle assessments (LCAs) of food items or groups. Some articles used a top-down methodology with input-output analysis to scale self-reported consumption data to match food supply [

 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">32</xref>]. This top-down and bottom-up hybrid model accounted for food waste and underreporting of consumption, giving a more accurate GHGE profile of the food supply. In diet articles, the primary method for reducing GHGE and improving health outcomes was to reduce consumption of meat and animal products. Limiting diet modifications to reduced meat and animal products is a practical first step because the health and GHGE impact of meat, particularly beef and processed meat, is significant and widely agreed upon. However, if meat consumption is reduced practical replacements need to be identified as individuals are likely to look for alternative calorie sources. Many of the articles considered substituting meat with produce and grains. This is a much more challenging task, as performing LCAs is laborious. Knowing which foods and production systems produce lower GHGE is essential for making recommendations for a sustainable diet. Also, while many people in OECD countries consume an excess amount of meat and protein, excess consumption is not ubiquitous. It is important that appropriate alternatives for beneficial meat nutrients (i.e., protein, iron, B vitamins) are identified in substitute diets in order to make sustainable diet recommendations. The co-benefits of reduced meat and consequently reduced calorie intake are evident but different from that of an isocaloric alternative diet.
