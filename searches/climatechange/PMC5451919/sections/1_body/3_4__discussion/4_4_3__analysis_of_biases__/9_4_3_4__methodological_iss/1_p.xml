<p class="p">The article selection may be biased as articles included were all published in English language, peer-reviewed journals. Our analysis of included articles relied heavily on the rubric of biases, uncertainties, limitations described in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>. The rubric was generalized to apply both to diet and active transport articles and may not identify every area of importance in evaluating each body of literature. Also, by limiting our review to articles that examine both the health and GHGE outcomes, contributions from articles that examine only one of the two outcomes were excluded.
