<p class="p">Despite the prevalence of uncertainties, the multi-potent disease prevention and treatment potential of diet and physical activity interventions should not be overlooked. Indeed, diet and physical activity/exercise interventions would make for a healthier, more resilient general population, with the likely flow-on benefit of reduce hospital admissions and reduced GHGE from the health sector. Thus, diet modifications and active transport will continue to improve GHGE and health outcomes, however, the scale of their effect will change over time and individuals will not be impacted equally by these mitigation strategies.</p>
