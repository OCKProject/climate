 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. Parametric uncertainties arose from: model assumptions concerning the level of diet or active transport modification obtainable, air pollution dispersal model parameters, and relative risk for morbidity and mortality associated with physical activity or diet. Structural uncertainties of the model resulted from assumptions about exposure and health outcome relationship (linear vs. non-linear), identification of relevant health outcomes, safety-in-numbers effect on cycling injury and fatality, and inclusion of the appropriate food items and categories. Most articles included sensitivity analysis methods such as stochastic Monte Carlo analysis or inclusion of multiple model formulations to address some of these uncertainties. It has been asserted that there are four primary sources of uncertainties in modeling health co-benefits: (1) simulating change in health determining exposures over space and time; (2) following change in exposure, determining the time response for health effects; (3) comparing mitigation strategies and their health effects over time within a population; and (4) establishing burden of disease projections into the future in the absence of mitigation [
 <xref rid="B44-ijerph-14-00468" ref-type="bibr" class="xref">44</xref>]. These sources of uncertainty were demonstrated in the reviewed articles.
