<p class="p">In the simulation of change in a health determining exposure (point 1 above), the feasibility of widespread and extensive diet or transportation modifications over space and time must be addressed and was in some articles. Linear programming models incorporated constraints to improve the acceptability of their proposed diets, whereas, Aston et al. [

It is imperative that research focuses on sustainable diets that are applicable for the geographic region of interest and practical to present to policymakers and stakeholders. Similarly, commuting distances make it unlikely that US cities will reach the levels of active transport seen in the Netherlands, unless city densities increase significantly. The challenge weather poses to increasing physical activity in certain locations and seasons should also be considered, particularly in the context of climate change [
