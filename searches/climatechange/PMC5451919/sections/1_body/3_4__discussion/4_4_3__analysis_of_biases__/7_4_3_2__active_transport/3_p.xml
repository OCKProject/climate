<p class="p">Active transport articles all estimated morbidity or mortality associated with physical activity, but estimations varied as to whether they also include the effects of pollutant exposure and traffic accidents on heath (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t003" class="xref">Table 3</xref>). The impact of physical activity on health outcomes was estimated using the HEAT model, comparative risk assessment, or systems dynamics modeling (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-ijerph-14-00468" class="xref">Table S4</xref>). Many of the active transport articles incorporated PM

 <sub class="sub">10</sub> (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less or 10 μm or less, respectively) into their analysis of health outcomes as a measure of pollutant exposure. Although it is not the only pollutant with a health impact, PM is considered the most relevant factor in predicting health outcomes [
