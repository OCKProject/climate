<p class="p">Transportation-related emissions are a significant contributor to global GHGE. In this review, “greener” transportation options estimated GHGE as almost zero for active transport, a lower per capital emissions level for public transportation, or as a lower greenhouse gases emit per kilometer traveled for cleaner operating vehicles. To estimate transportation-related emissions in a given geographical area, traffic patterns and air dispersal patterns were estimated via generalized tools such as the SIM-air Model developed by UrbanEmisssions.info or the COPERT4 software from the European Environment Agency.</p>
