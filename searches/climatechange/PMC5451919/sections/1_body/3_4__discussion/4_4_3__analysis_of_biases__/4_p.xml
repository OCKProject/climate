<p class="p">As per point 3, diet and physical activity changes may affect individuals within the population differently depending on age, sex, and baseline activity and diet. Additionally, food production, automotive technology, and medical practices are continually developing, thus estimates of the impact of diet modification and active transport will change over time. The GHGE estimates produced in these articles may become less reliable as technology advances. It is also important to recognize that population-based health outcomes could improve with better medical intervention, independent of exercise or diet modification. This potential impact on the level of disease burden within a population is a source of uncertainty (point 4). Estimations of the future burden of disease were not attempted in these models, though some models incorporated this uncertainty in their future projections according to published burden of disease estimates [
