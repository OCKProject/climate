<p class="p">Two authors performed a second evaluation of each article using a rubric.

 <xref ref-type="table" rid="ijerph-14-00468-t001" class="xref">Table 1</xref>). Articles received a binary score for meeting or failing to meet each of the criteria and were evaluated by two of the authors independently. Following evaluation of all selected articles, rubric outcomes for each article were compared and any discrepancies between the two authors’ scoring were resolved by a previously agreed upon arbitrator if necessary. Accordingly, articles were assigned a final score in each of the three categories (general and GHGE categories were scored from zero to five and the health category was scored from zero to ten). The rubric was derived from that used by Yip et al. [
