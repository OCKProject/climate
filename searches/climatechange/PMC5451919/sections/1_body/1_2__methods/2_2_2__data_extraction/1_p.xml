<p class="p">We created a data extraction tool guided by the PRISMA guidelines. Two authors tested the tool on a subset of the literature and revisions were made until the tool design was agreed upon. The evaluation included: authors; publication date; study population description, including age, gender, time and geography; baseline data sources; study design; health and GHGE analysis methods; and outcomes. </p>
