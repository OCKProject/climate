<p class="p">Two separate searches were conducted, one for active transport health co-benefits literature and one for dietary health co-benefits literature. In both cases, searches were performed in ScienceDirect (1995 to present), PubMed (1940s to present), and Google Scholar. The last search was performed 7 July 2014. For the active transport literature, search terms included greenhouse gas, emissions, health, co-benefits, active transport, and active travel. The primary search in ScienceDirect was as follows: (“greenhouse gas” OR emissions) AND health AND co-benefit AND (“active transport” or “active travel”). For the dietary literature, search terms included greenhouse gas, emissions, health, co-benefits, food, and diet. The primary search in ScienceDirect was as follows: (“greenhouse gas” OR emissions) AND food AND diet AND health AND (“co-benefit” or cobenefit). Articles that were deemed irrelevant based on title and abstract were excluded. The full text of the remaining, relevant articles was retrieved and further reviewed for inclusion based on the pre-defined inclusion criteria described below. Relevant articles cited within the literature were also sought out and analyzed for inclusion. </p>
