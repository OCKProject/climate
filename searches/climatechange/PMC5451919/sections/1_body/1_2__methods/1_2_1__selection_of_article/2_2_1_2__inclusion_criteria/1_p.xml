<p class="p">Articles on greenhouse gas mitigation strategies related to lifestyle choices with health co-benefits were of interest. The lifestyle-related mitigation strategies in the existing literature include active transport and diet. For inclusion, an article must have quantified both the GHGE and the health or nutrition impact of at least one of the lifestyle-related mitigation strategies. The most common reason for exclusion was quantification of either (as oppose to both) the GHGE or the health or nutrition impact of at least one of the lifestyle-related mitigation strategies. English language articles published in peer-reviewed journals were considered without date restrictions. Review articles were not included. Due to the wide range of GHGE and health outcome measurements of interest, meta-analysis was not a goal of this review. </p>
