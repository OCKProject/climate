<p class="p">Variation in body size of American bison (Artiodactyla, Bovidae) has been a contentious topic for more than 7 decades (Dary,

 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0079" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1947</xref>) synthesized and synonymized 52 species of bison down to eight species using primarily skulls and horn cores which respond plastically to sexual selection. McDonald (

 <italic class="italic">Bison bison</italic>,
 <italic class="italic"> B. occidentalis</italic>, and 
 <italic class="italic">B. antiquus</italic>, which represent a smaller body size in comparison with the larger, giant bison (
 <italic class="italic">B. priscus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. latifrons</italic>). Yet, the skulls of these smaller species still represent plastic variation, likely due to sexual selection, not representative of overall body size. To avoid the issues surrounding problems with cranial morphology, our study here focuses on the postcranial body size reconstruction, particularly of a mechanistic element to the structure of the skeleton. Our assessment is that the extant bison clade species may represent a linear chronospecies and is supported by recent ancient DNA assessments (Froese et al.,

 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0078" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2004</xref>). Likely, 
 <italic class="italic">B. antiquus</italic> and 
 <italic class="italic">B. occidentalis</italic> did not go extinct, but through phenotypic and morphologic adaptation to changing climatic conditions, evolved into what is traditionally referred to as 
 <italic class="italic">B. bison</italic> that we have throughout the Holocene and this is what we present below.
