 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Global temperature in the 21st century is expected to rise between 1 and 4°C above the 20th‐century average (IPCC Working Group 1, 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0049" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2014</xref>). Past global and regional climates can be reconstructed using isotopic markers from ice cores and marine sediments and using limnological data such as species of pollen and diatoms, and charcoal in geological context. Currently, the longest and highest resolution records for reconstructing past atmospheric conditions are stable isotopes of oxygen (
