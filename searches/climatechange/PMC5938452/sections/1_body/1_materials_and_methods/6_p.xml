<p class="p">We used mixed model regressions for each metric of the calcaneum to compare species as a fixed effect with 
 <italic class="italic">B. bison</italic> as the base for the comparison (Stata v14.2, 2015, StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA). Similarly, mixed models were used to compare DstL with other calcaneal metrics with species as a fixed effect. The fixed effects of species, temperature, and latitude were included in the model to analyze DstL and estimates of body mass from measures of DstL (Christiansen, 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0016" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2002</xref>). We used two estimates of temperature in the models: GISP2 temperatures and the relative global temperature anomaly. All mixed models included site as a random effect to account for repeated measures within each location. We used the robust “sandwich estimator” to relax assumptions of normal distribution and homogeneity of variance for the regression (Bolker et al.,
