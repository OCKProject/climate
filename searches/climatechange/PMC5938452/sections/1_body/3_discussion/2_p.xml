<p class="p">Our data supported our hypothesis that global climate change drives body size of 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> spp., that is, as temperatures warmed, 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> became smaller. Generally, described as Bergmann’s Rule (Bergmann, 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0011" ref-type="ref" class="xref">1847</xref>), endotherms increase in body size with increasing latitude (Huston &amp; Wolverton, 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0048" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2011</xref>). It is likely that negative correlation between temperature and latitude is driving Bergmann's rule (i.e., body size) because even though we found that bison are larger at cooler temperatures, we were unable to correlate a significant effect of latitude over the geologic record (

 <italic class="italic"> </italic>.94). The negative relationship between body mass and global temperature may reflect underlying relationships between body size and net primary production as well as heat loads (Speakman &amp; Król,
