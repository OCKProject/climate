 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> today express a 30% body mass gradient from north to south, that is, 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> in Saskatchewan (52°N) are at least 30% larger than those in Texas (30°N (Craine, 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0022" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2013</xref>, p. 3)). This body size gradient is likely associated with latitudinal variation in timing of reproduction and parturition as well as windows for growth (Barboza et al., 
 <xref rid="ece34019-bib-0007" ref-type="ref" class="xref">2009</xref>). Quantifying and comparing physiological thresholds and mechanisms driving body size change are imperative for managing 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> and other large herbivores (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece34019-fig-0001" ref-type="fig" class="xref">1</xref>). Conservation goals among latitudinally disparate 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> herds in North America should consider that resident 
 <italic class="italic">Bison</italic> will likely grow smaller and more slowly in the south than in the north, which will impact management strategies at both regional and continental scales.
