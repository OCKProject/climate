<p class="p">Although the projected climate change response over the coming century in these environmental drivers is large, so is the natural variability encountered by marine organisms, suggesting that some species have the capacity to adapt or acclimate to change

Importantly though, natural variability occurs on timescales of a few years (interannual variability) to millennia (glacialâ€“interglacial cycles), whereas climate change is essentially a one-way street, so that associated changes in the marine environment are unlikely to be reversed. Hence, climate change will eventually push marine ecosystem drivers beyond the range of natural variability, potentially resulting in migration of species
