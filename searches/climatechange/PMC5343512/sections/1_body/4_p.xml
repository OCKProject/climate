<p class="p">Although the response of the marine ecosystem to changing drivers is not yet clear, it is nevertheless important to quantify when, where and which combinations of stressors are likely to occur. Of particular relevance for an organism's ability to adapt to a changing climate is the speed with which drivers of ecosystem stress emerge from the background of natural variability

Organisms must be adapted to at least the annual extrema in conditions during winter and summer (the seasonal variability), which in almost all locations exceeds interannual variability. The more rapidly the system is pushed out of its natural range of variability, the less time the organisms will have to adapt or acclimate to the new conditions or migrate to more suitable areas. Where rapid emergence of multiple drivers occurs, marine ecosystems and dependent socio-economic systems may be unable to adjust sufficiently quickly to avert disruption.
