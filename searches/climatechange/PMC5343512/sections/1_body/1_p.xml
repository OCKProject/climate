<p class="p">Research has generally focused on the potential negative effects of climate change on marine ecosystems. For example, ocean pH is reduced by increasing atmospheric CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5" class="xref">5</xref>. Warming ocean temperatures are associated with increased ocean stratification, which restricts nutrient supply to photosynthetic organisms in surface waters
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9" class="xref">9</xref>. The solubility of oxygen and exchange of subsurface waters with the atmosphere will also be reduced with warmer temperatures, driving lower oceanic oxygen concentrations with potentially negative effects on marine organisms

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>. However, in some cases positive (or neutral) responses to potential marine stressors have been observed

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13" class="xref">13</xref>, implying that uncertainty surrounding the future of the marine ecosystem is large. Here we adopt the terminology that a change in a potential stressor where the ecosystem response is unknown (and may not necessarily be negative) is termed a â€˜driver'.
