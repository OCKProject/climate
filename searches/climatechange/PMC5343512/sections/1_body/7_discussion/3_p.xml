<p class="p">Our model results suggest that seasonal minimum pH levels have been lower than the previously experienced natural range for &gt;90 years already. This is consistent with analyses of (shorter) observational records, which suggest that trends in ocean acidification are likely to be anthropogenically driven

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59" class="xref">59</xref>. However, evidence that this change has had a significant or lasting impact on marine organisms is scarce, except perhaps for warm-water coral communities
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60" class="xref">60</xref>. Does this imply that the marine ecosystem is actually rather resilient to climate change? The key factor may be the speed with which climate change emerges in marine ecosystem drivers relative to the speed with which organisms can adapt. Individual species can seemingly adapt relatively rapidly (compared with the timescales of climate change) to new conditions. For example, a tropical reef fish was found to acclimate to acute exposure to warmer temperatures within two generations (damselfish have lifespans of &gt;5 years
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61" class="xref">61</xref>). Organisms with shorter lifespans, such as phytoplankton (∼few days), adapt correspondingly more rapidly. Coccolithophores, for example, adapted to a large degree to more acidic conditions within 500 generations
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62" class="xref">62</xref>. The fossil record can also provide some insight into the possible impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems (although the paleoclimate changed at slower rates than projected for anthropogenic climate change). During the Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum for example, up to 50% of benthic foraminifera went extinct

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64" class="xref">64</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" class="xref">65</xref>. Although the limits of adaptation capacity are presently very poorly known, past extinctions at slower rates of climate change suggest that adaptation rates in some organisms are unlikely to be fast enough to keep pace, ultimately implying extinction.
