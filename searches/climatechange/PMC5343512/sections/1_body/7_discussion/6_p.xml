<p class="p">Currently, it is not clear whether ecosystem-wide adaptation or migration can outpace the speed at which multiple drivers emerge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1</xref>). How individual species will fare, or how the ecosystem as the sum of its parts will fare, is poorly understood. What is clear however is that there are likely to be winners and losers in the future ocean
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68" class="xref">68</xref>. However, lacking the ability to predict the future impact of drivers on marine ecosystems creates significant challenges to determining an appropriate course for sustainable management of the ecosystem services, such as fisheries, that they provide. The quantification of the ToE of multiple drivers presented here is an important first step in achieving an understanding of the response of marine ecosystems to future climate change.
