<p class="p">Translating the emergence of climate drivers that we present here into an understanding of how the structure and functioning of the marine ecosystem may respond is an extremely challenging task. The interplay between biogeochemical stressors, including synergistic effects, adaptation and migration potential and speed, the bioclimatic envelope, organisms' climate sensitivity, non-linear responses to changing conditions, short-term acclimatization and extinction risk is complex in the extreme. Even the first step, of connecting the emergence of climate change in ocean conditions with potential stress in marine organisms, requires the implicit assumption that the niche width of an organism scales with the local variability it experiences, and if conditions exceed that variability then a response (whether negative or positive) may occur. However, many species appear to thrive in environments that are less than optimal, for example, some marine fish and invertebrates have warmer or cooler temperature optima than the environment in which they are found

In addition, the emergence of persistent, anomalously low oxygen (compared to previous seasonal variability) may not be of relevance to individual organisms if concentrations still remain above hypoxic levels, although oxygen has been found to limit animal life even at higher concentrations
