<p class="p">We demonstrate that a heterogeneous mosaic of multiple environmental drivers develops in the next 50 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). This mosaic suggests that species resilient to change in one driver but negatively affected by another may be able to migrate to newly formed suitable habitats, provided the velocity of climate change (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16" class="xref">16</xref>) does not outpace migration speed. In addition, some species may be able to alter their depth range so that they avoid decreases in thermocline oxygen whilst still remaining within their thermal niche (note that here we only assess changes in surface temperature). Again, little is known about the potential migration speed of marine organisms. Large motile species such as fishes and mammals are likely to be able to migrate rapidly to more favourable conditions (although locating these refugia may not be as simple as tracking a northward-moving isotherm). Smaller motile species, such as zooplankton, have also been observed to migrate in response to climate trends or variability, as in the North Atlantic where the distribution of warm-water copepod species has shifted northward in recent decades
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" class="xref">66</xref>. Planktonic species may be able to rely on rapid dispersal to maintain populations, whereas sessile species may not be able to migrate sufficiently rapidly to keep pace with future climate change. Returning to the Paleoceneâ€“Eocene Thermal Maximum as an analogy, mobile crustaceans avoided significant community changes
