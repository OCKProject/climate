<p class="p">We find that the climate change-driven trend in pH already exceeds the range in natural seasonal variability over most of the ocean, as does SST in the subtropics and Arctic. For PP and interior oxygen content, although the trend is large, the natural variability is also large, resulting in later ToE. Species adapted to living in regions of low variability are likely to have relatively narrow environmental niches
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8" class="xref">8</xref> and may be living close to their maximum tolerance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57" class="xref">57</xref>. Subtropical and tropical species are therefore likely to be more sensitive to the rapid emergence of climate change trends. Polar species are also particularly vulnerable as they cannot shift their geographical range northward in response to emerging drivers and so must either adapt to changing conditions or go extinct
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58" class="xref">58</xref>. However, new ecological niches may open for species resilient to ocean acidification and warming waters and inured to the large natural variability that occurs in PP and oxygen.
