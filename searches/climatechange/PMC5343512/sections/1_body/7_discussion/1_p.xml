<p class="p">The vulnerability of the marine ecosystem to climate change is considered to be a function of exposure and sensitivity to stressors, combined with adaptive capacity

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54" class="xref">54</xref>. In this study, we quantify one part of this equationâ€”the potential for exposure to environmental drivers. Marine ecosystems, and the individual organisms that make up those ecosystems, are adapted to the range of conditions they experience
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34" class="xref">34</xref>. When the environment changes sufficiently that new conditions, or a new combination of conditions, emerge and persist, the organisms must adapt, migrate to more favourable areas, or face extinction. In this way, climate forcing can induce changes at the organism level, which result in changes to ecosystem structure, species interactions and food web dynamics

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56" class="xref">56</xref>. If novel conditions emerge rapidly, species have less time to either adapt or migrate, potentially increasing the probability that disruption to the ecosystem will occur.
