<p class="p">Slowing the pace of climate change could give species more time to adapt to changing conditions or migrate to more suitable areas, potentially reducing extinction risk. Although most ecosystems have the capacity to adapt to changing conditions to some extent

For other species, the timescales over which threshold changes in environmental stressors emerge will be key to determining the degree of disruption
