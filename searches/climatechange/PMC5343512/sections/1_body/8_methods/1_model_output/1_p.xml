 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>. For all models the monthly output for 100-year sections taken from the end of the preindustrial control run, the historical run (1860–2005) and for the RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 scenarios for 2006–2100 were downloaded. The variables SST (‘tos' in the CMIP archive), surface pH (‘ph'), total annual vertically integrated PP (‘intpp') and dissolved oxygen (‘o2') in the thermocline (200–600 m depth range, as in refs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11" class="xref">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>) were used. All data were re-gridded onto a regular 1° × 1° grid using linear nearest-neighbour interpolation. In the case of depth-resolved dissolved oxygen concentrations, monthly output is not a standard CMIP5 output. Data were therefore sourced from the model progenitors directly; however, output could not be obtained for HadGEM2-CC, HadGEM2-ES or IPSL-CM5B-LR models and so only nine models were used for the monthly oxygen analysis. Preindustrial control run output was detrended, if necessary, using a linear regression prior to further analysis. For each year of model output, the annual maxima (for SST) and minima (pH, thermocline oxygen and PP) were extracted.
