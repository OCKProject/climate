<p class="p">This criterion ensures that the trend exceeds 95% of the values in the noise, assuming it is normally distributed, and therefore that the emerging signal is highly unusual. Any values of ToE exceeding 2100 are excluded from further analysis. Assumptions of normality and heteroskedasticity in the residuals from the trend regression were checked using the Lilliefors and Breusch–Pagan test, respectively. Approximately 5–30% of pixels fail one of the tests and, for most models and variables, these pixels are predominantly in the Arctic. Assuming a normal distribution for trends in annual extrema is reasonable given the low percentage (5–30%) of pixels where the assumption is not met. Where the assumptions are not met, the ToE criterion will not necessarily indicate that the trend exceeds 95% of the noise values, and may instead be lower. The ToE is calculated for each individual model and the median year for each pixel is then used as the ensemble mean. The inter-model difference in ToE is expressed as ±1 s.d. The pace of climate change is described here by the difference (in years) between the ToE and the start of the climate change signal. All analyses were performed in Matlab (Mathworks).</p>
