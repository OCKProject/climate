<p class="p">All analyses are performed at every model grid cell, separately for each model. To calculate the ToE, first the time series of annual extrema in the conjoined historical and warming scenario runs is created. Then, an inflection point is located by calculating the cumulative sum of the gradient in 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> (δ
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>/δ
 <italic class="italic">t</italic>) and identifying the year when it exceeds zero (for a positive trend) or drops below zero (for a negative trend) for the remainder of the time series—we refer to this as the start of the climate change signal (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref>). The trend in 
 <italic class="italic">Y</italic>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> is then calculated from that start point forward to 2100 using 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq1" class="xref">equation (1)</xref>. The natural variability (or noise) is defined as one standard deviation in annual extrema of a 100-year section of the model's control run. As a consequence, the natural variability as defined here accounts for only the unforced natural variability, excluding the influence of changing incoming solar radiation or volcanoes. The ToE is then defined as:
