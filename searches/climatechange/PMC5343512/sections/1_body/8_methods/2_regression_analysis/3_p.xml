 <sub class="sub">t</sub> is the annual extreme in the variable, 
 <italic class="italic">μ</italic> is a constant term (the intercept), 
 <italic class="italic">t</italic> is the linear trend function (here time in years), 
 <italic class="italic">ω</italic> is the magnitude of the trend (the slope) and 
 <italic class="italic">N</italic>
 <sub class="sub">t</sub> is the unexplained portion of the data, which is modelled as an AR(1) process. Trends for SST are reported as °C per decade; for PP, pH and oxygen as the % change per decade with respect to the mean of 1986–2005. The assumption of normality in the annual extrema was checked using the Lilliefors test. Approximately 80% of pixels pass the test for pH and SST, and ∼65% for PP and oxygen. The majority of pixels failing these tests are in the Arctic.
