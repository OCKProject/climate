<p class="p">The ToE is illustrated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1" class="xref">Fig. 1a–d</xref>. The climate change signals of pH and SST emerge very rapidly (global median of 1924 (±4.7 years) for pH and 2034 (±8.8 years) for SST; ±=inter-model s.d. on the global median). Indeed, the climate change signal in pH already exceeds the bounds of natural variability (ToE&lt;2016) in 99% (±0.5%) of the open ocean. The climate change signal in SST has also already emerged in the subtropics and the Arctic. The climate change trends in PP and interior oxygen content emerge later (global median of 2052 (±12 years) for oxygen and 2070 (±8.3 years) for PP).
