 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Table 1</xref>), we construct time series for each variable of annual maxima (for SST) or minima (for pH, PP and oxygen) for the period 1860–2100 using a combination of the historical runs (1860–2005) and future scenarios (2006–2100)

The start of the climate change signal is defined as the year when conditions become persistently uni-directional, and the time of emergence (ToE) is defined as the year when annual extrema exceed the long-term trend persistently for the remainder of the time series. The long-term trend is presented in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> provide more details on ToE definition. The ToE presented here thus represents the exposure of the ecosystem to conditions outside the range of previously experienced seasonal variability. In contrast to previous work on emergence of marine stressors, for example, refs

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45" class="xref">45</xref>, but we are constrained here by the temporal resolution of the available model output. In addition, the coarse model grid (1° × 1°) eliminates small-scale spatial variability. If natural variability is higher than we estimate (but the trend is of similar magnitude) then ToE will be later than we calculate.
