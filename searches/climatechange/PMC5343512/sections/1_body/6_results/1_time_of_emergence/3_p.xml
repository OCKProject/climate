<p class="p">The pace of climate change is represented here by the length of time (in years) between the start of the climate change signal and its emergence from the background natural variability (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). pH undergoes both a rapid pace of change and emerges early, due to its very small interannual variability, and because a large fraction of anthropogenic CO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47" class="xref">47</xref>). For SST, the pace is most rapid (&lt;25 years) in subtropical and Arctic regions, and considerably slower in subpolar areas (&gt;50 years). Interior oxygen content evinces a slower pace of change, with the exception of the Northeast Pacific, where models likely underestimate the large natural variability associated with major climate modes
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48" class="xref">48</xref>. PP shows the slowest pace of change, potentially because PP acts as an integrator of changes in light, temperature and nutrients. The later ToE in PP is consistent with previous observations that trends are more rapidly detectable in parameters such as SST and pH than in PP, primarily due to the large natural variability in the latter
