<p class="p">As we have shown, following a ‘business-as-usual' emissions pathway (RCP8.5) results in rapid emergence of multiple drivers of the marine environment. The aim of mitigation activities is to reduce the magnitude and rate of climate change impacts. To what extent then can mitigation limit or slow the pace of ecosystem stress emergence? Projections with the IPCC RCP4.5 mitigation scenario demonstrate that the climate change trend in marine ecosystem drivers is reduced (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1" class="xref">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>); for example, the SST trend emerges in 2050 (±10.5 years). For PP, mitigation results in only small regions of the ocean experiencing climate change-driven conditions outside the range of natural variability before 2100 (
