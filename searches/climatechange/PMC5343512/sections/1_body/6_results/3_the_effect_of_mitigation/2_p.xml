Note, however, that ocean acidification is unavoidable; although reduced in a mitigation scenario, it has already emerged as a driver across the entire open ocean. The pronounced reduction in multiple stress conditions due to mitigation persists through 2050 with only 69% (±12%) of the ocean exposed, compared with 86% (±10%) under the ‘business-as-usual' scenario. Even by 2100, in the mitigation scenario only 30% (±4%) of the ocean is affected by all four ecosystem drivers, in contrast to the 62% (±5%) in the ‘business-as-usual' scenario, and there exist large areas where PP remains within the range of natural variability. Mitigation slows the pace of potential ecosystem exposure substantially, delaying the widespread emergence of the ‘quadruple whammy'
