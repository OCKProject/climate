 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51" class="xref">51</xref>. Here we demonstrate that by 2030 regions encountering multiple drivers, principally by pH and SST, dominate the ocean (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2aâ€“d</xref>). Species sensitive to change in pH and/or temperature will likely need to adapt to these new conditions very rapidly. In particular, regions of low variability (for example, subtropics) will potentially be more vulnerable to climate change as these areas emerge both earliest and most rapidly. However, although ocean acidification and warming are widespread, the climate change signal in PP and oxygen remains smaller than the substantial natural variability in most regions in the near future. The exception is the Arctic, which appears to be a hotspot of change with rapid emergence of the climate change response in pH, SST and oxygen content. (However, note that the Arctic Ocean is also a region of high model uncertainty in projections of PP
