<p class="p">By 2050, a mosaic of multiple environmental drivers has emerged (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2" class="xref">Fig. 2c</xref>). Where previously climate change trends in pH and SST dominated the patterns of environmental change, a more heterogeneous patchwork of multiple drivers now develops. In 86% (±10%) of the ocean, multiple drivers have emerged, implying the potential for widespread disruption to marine ecosystems. By 2100 an ocean environment has developed in which climate change trends have emerged in all four marine drivers of ecosystem stress in 62% (±5%) of the ocean (
