<p class="p">In addition, marine ecosystem drivers rarely vary in isolation and multiple factors may act additively or synergistically to increase the impact of a single driver

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20" class="xref">20</xref>. For example, ocean acidification may alter the carbon to nitrogen ratio of sinking organic material so that more oxygen is required for remineralisation

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22" class="xref">22</xref>. Ocean acidification may act in concert with rising temperatures to reduce coccolithophore abundance or calcite production

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26" class="xref">26</xref>. The synergistic effects of multiple drivers are challenging to investigate in field or lab studies, due to the difficulties of undertaking multi-factorial experiments over multiple generations. However, existing observational evidence tends to suggest that co-occurring stress can add to or amplify the effect of a single stressor

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28" class="xref">28</xref>. For example, warming and ocean acidification have antagonistic effects on sea urchin larval growth, resulting in minimal overall impact (although both have a negative effect on larval abnormality
