<p class="p">Here we examine how rapidly climate change signals in the annual extrema of the drivers of ecosystem stress emerge from the background of natural variability in several ocean properties (sea surface temperature (SST), pH, PP and interior oxygen content), focusing on when and where multiple drivers occur simultaneously. Further, we investigate whether mitigation efforts are able to slow the pace at which multiple drivers emerge. We quantify when the climate change signal exceeds natural variability in the principal drivers of marine ecosystem stress identified by the IPCC under two climate change scenarios

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37" class="xref">37</xref> and a mitigation scenario (RCP4.5). The mitigation scenario was chosen as representative of a possible post-COP21 situation, as a result of which nations submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions to indicate their intended level of emissions post 2020. Even if achieved, these intended cumulative emissions still imply a median warming of 2.6–3.1 °C by 2100 (ref.
