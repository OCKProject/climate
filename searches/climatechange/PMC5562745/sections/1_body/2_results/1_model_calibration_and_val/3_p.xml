 </sup>, we selected 14 of the 31 sub-basins in the Heihe agricultural region, which collectively contain all land use and soil types in the region, combined them with the ET data, and used them as the objectives for parameter calibration. The remaining 17 sub-basins were selected for validation. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" class="xref">2</xref>, the P-factor was &gt;0.5 for 50% of the calibrated sub-basins and for 41.2% of the validated sub-basins. The R-factor was relatively small, its value was always &lt;1.0. The NS coefficient value was &gt;0.6 in 78.6% of the calibrated sub-basins and in 58.8% of the validated sub-basins. The model also calculated the efficiency criteria of the best simulation. The Φ value was &gt;0.7 in 71.4% of the calibrated sub-basins and in 52.9% of the validated sub-basins. Overall, we concluded that the calibrated SWAT model accurately represents the study area and that the results are acceptable for use, particularly in the agricultural area.
