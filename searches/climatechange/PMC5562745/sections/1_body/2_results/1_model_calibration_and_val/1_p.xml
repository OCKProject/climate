<p id="Par18" class="p">Many SWAT model parameters are difficult to obtain through observation. Various parameters have differing effects on hydrological processes. Sensitivity analysis can identify the effects and importance of model parameters that can then be targeted for adjustment to improve the accuracy of the model. We analyzed the results from the hydrological processes calculation module of the SWAT model. The analysis provided a ranking of model parameters by order of importance. We finally selected the following 10 parameters to be calibrated: ESCO, CANMX, SOL_AWC, SOL_BD, EPCO, HVSTI, GW_REVAP, CN2, GSI and GWQMN (TableÂ
