<p id="Par19" class="p">The four evaluation indices (P-factor, R-factor, NS and Φ) were optimized by repeatedly adjusting the range of each parameter until we obtained a steady parameter value. Table

 </sup> suggest that the value of ESCO should be varied between 0.75 and 1.0, and we used the value 0.94. This relatively high ESCO value indicates that soil evaporation has a weak influence on the whole evaporation process because of the high vegetation coverage, high plastic film mulch coverage, and low air temperature in the Heihe agricultural region. The maximum canopy storage (CANMX) has a significant effect on hydrological processes, especially for evapotranspiration in arid areas. The value of CANMX for farmland in this study was 16.25 (mm). The plant uptake compensation factor (EPCO) has an important effect on the ET simulation. When the EPCO value is close to 1, the crop can extract more water from the lower soil layer; when it is closer to 0, water absorption from the soil is limited. The calibrated value of EPCO was 0.1, mainly because local soil is very porous and there is little capillary water movement. The harvest index (HVSTI) and maximum stomatal conductance (GSI) were calibrated to 0.52 and 1.77 m/s, respectively, as given by Jiang
