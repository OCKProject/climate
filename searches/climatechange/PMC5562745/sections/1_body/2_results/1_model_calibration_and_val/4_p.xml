<p id="Par21" class="p">The results were further evaluated by comparisons of simulated ET and observed ET in typical sub-basins, which are predominantly bare soil (sub-basin 3) and cultivated land (sub-basin 31). Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" class="xref">3</xref> and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table" class="xref">2</xref> show that the simulation agreed well with the observed values for two typical sub-basins, and the statistical values of the indicators demonstrated that the model performed well. The NS and Φ values were mostly ≥0.7, RMSE was in the range 1.72–4.95 mm, RB was in the range −0.08 to +0.02, and the indicators E, E
 <sub class="sub">1</sub>, and d
 <sub class="sub">r</sub> were simultaneously close to 1. These values also indicate that the calibrated SWAT model reasonably well simulates ET in the area. The ETWatch platform uses daily net radiation, soil moisture, and wind speed, which have been shown to be the most important factors of surface resistance, to estimate daily surface resistance. ETWatch combines these factors with meteorological data using the Penman–Monteith equation to estimate daily ET. However, ET calculation in SWAT is indirect since it does not use meteorological factors to directly calculate ET. So we can find that the method of calculating ET is independent between these two models, and thus we conclude that the SWAT model provides reliable data for the analysis of changes in ET and permits accurate identification of the factors that drive the changes.
