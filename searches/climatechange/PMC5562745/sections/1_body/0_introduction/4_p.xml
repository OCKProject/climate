 </sup> analyzed the large scale spatial distribution of crop ET using geographic information systems (GIS) data and principal component analysis. They concluded that the main influences on ET from winter wheat in northern China were thermodynamics, water, and micro-topography. Hu

 </sup> used GIS data and factor analysis of 13 factors that influenced ET from spring wheat in Hexi Corridor. Their results showed that the three principal factors were meteorology, wind speed, and geography. However, multiple time series analysis would have been a better method to identify the major influences on ET in an agricultural region. Where there is a limited amount of water available for crop use, it is critical to identify the core factors that influence ET in order to study water consumption in arid conditions. However, there are few studies of ET in arid agricultural areas that use multiple time series analysis.
