 </sup> coupled an irrigation application model with the ETWatch platform to simulate the spatial distribution of ET in the Haihe Plain in northern China. Remote sensing technology is continually improving and it is now possible to combine a distributed hydrological model with data provided by remote sensing technology in order to estimate long-term ET changes over recent years. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is a distributed hydrological model that has been widely used in hydrological cycle studies around the world

 </sup> used a SWAT model which had been calibrated using the remotely-sensed ET data extracted from a SEBAL model to predict the impacts of climate change on the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater and consumptive water use in the Lower Chenab Canal of the Indus basin in Pakistan. Combining a SWAT model with remotely-sensed ET data is a relatively new method of calibrating a SWAT model, it provides a technique for estimating the long range ET in a region.
