<p id="Par2" class="p">Evapotranspiration (ET) consists of evaporation and plant transpiration processes which move water from the earthâ€™s surface to the atmosphere. ET is a key part of the water cycle, which is responsible for the distribution of water and energy on land surfaces, especially in arid and semi-arid areas

 </sup>. Many attempts to accurately estimate the rate of ET from different land surface covers have been made in agriculture, meteorology, hydrology, soil science and other related disciplines
