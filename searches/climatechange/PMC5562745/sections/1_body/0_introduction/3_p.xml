 </sup> found that in Israel the increase in ET during the period 1964â€“1998 was caused by increases in vapour pressure deficit and in wind speed. Qian

 </sup> used the surface model CLM 3.0, combined with precipitation, temperature, solar radiation, and other observational data, and found that global terrestrial ET and precipitation changes were highly correlated. Jung

 </sup> studied the trends and spatial distributions of global ET and found that the decrease in global ET since 1998 was probably due to a decrease in relative humidity. Liu

 </sup> studied changes in ET per unit area in response to optimization scenarios for crop planting patterns in Qingyuan irrigation district, and found that ET per unit area decreased as the proportion of grain crops was reduced. It is difficult to separately quantify the contributions of human activity and of climate change to changes in ET because there are few ET data available and models are not easy to construct. There have been few studies in this area.
