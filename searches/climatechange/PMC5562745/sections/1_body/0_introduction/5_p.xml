<p id="Par6" class="p">The agricultural region of the Heihe River basin, located in the middle of Hexi Corridor in northwest China, is important for grain, vegetable, and seed production. The basin has a key role in the water cycle and in the economic activity of the region. ET is the main consumption component (i.e. it effectively removes water from the watershed) of the water cycle on agricultural land. It can be considered as either ET per unit area or as total ET to explore the factors that have major influence on it. To be able to accurately identify the different contributions of human agricultural activities and of climate change to changes in ET is of great practical importance because to do so will enable growers to optimally use water and best respond to future climate change. The main objectives of this study are to identify the main factors that influence ET per unit area and total ET, and to calculate the contribution rates of these factors to changes in ET over a recent 31-year period. To this end, the spatiotemporal distribution of ET in this agricultural region over the past three decades was simulated by a SWAT model, and the remotely-sensed ET data was used to calibrate and validate the model simulations.</p>
