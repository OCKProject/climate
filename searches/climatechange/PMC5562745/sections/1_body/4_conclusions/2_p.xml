<p id="Par36" class="p">To reduce the demands of agricultural water usage in the Heihe River basin, and to ensure the sustainability of water resources in this arid region of northwest China, it is necessary to further rationalize the scale of agricultural production, to control the use of both plastic film mulch and fertilizer, and to implement water-saving measures.
