<p id="Par35" class="p">Comprehensive analysis of recent changes in land ET and of their contributions in terms of variable climatic and human factors is a challenging task due to the complex interactions between the factors. Using remotely-sensed ET products and SWAT modeling, this study analyzed changes in ET in the Heihe agricultural region over a 31-year period, and correlation analysis identified the dominant factors influencing ET per unit area and total ET. Factor analysis was used to quantify the contribution rate of each dominant factor to ET per unit area and to total ET. In the study area, the contribution rate of human activities, including the agronomic and irrigation factors, to increased ET per unit area and to increased total ET in the 31-year period was significantly larger than the respective contribution rates of climate change. There are some uncertainties in the results, and it is necessary to perform further analysis using more accurate data and more robust methods, but these results still provide valuable reference information to guide the improvement of agricultural water management.</p>
