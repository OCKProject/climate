<p id="Par8" class="p">The 31-year ET data, which cover the middle reach of the Heihe River basin for the period 1984–2014, were simulated by SWAT, which was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture–Agricultural Research Services (USDA–ARS). The model parameters were calibrated using the remotely-sensed ET data on a monthly timescale for the period 2000–2013. Annual ET simulations for the region were produced.</p>
