<p id="Par11" class="p">The climate data at eight meteorological stations (Dingxin, Jiuquan, Gaotai, Zhangye, Shandan, Tuole, Yeniugou, and Qilian) for the period 1982â€“2014 were used in the SWAT model. Data included daily precipitation, the minimum and maximum air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and global solar radiation. The main crop planted in the region is corn, which accounts for 77.19% of the crop acreage. Because there was little crop management data for other crops, this study considers only the agricultural management practices for corn, which include irrigation, fertilization, planting, and harvesting. The irrigation and fertilization schedule of each sub-basin was set to be the same as that of the irrigation zone where the center of the sub-basin was located. The auto-fertilization option was used to apply phosphorus fertilizer without consideration of phosphorus stress.</p>
