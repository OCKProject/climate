<p id="Par10" class="p">In the SWAT model, calculation of evapotranspiration requires parameters for vegetation canopy interception evaporation, soil evaporation, and crop transpiration. Each component needs to be calculated on the basis of potential evapotranspiration (PET) and observed environmental factors. The calculation order is PET, canopy interception evaporation, potential soil evaporation, and crop transpiration. The potential soil evaporation and crop transpiration values are distributed to each soil layer. Finally the soil evaporation and crop transpiration are calculated according to the soil moisture content of each layer. In this study, PET was simulated using the Penmanâ€“Monteith method

 </sup>. The meteorological data required for this method include air temperature, solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed. Air resistance and canopy resistance are estimated based on the crop height and the leaf area index (LAI). Potential soil evaporation is determined by PET of crop and soil coverage. When the soil moisture content is lower than the field capacity, the actual soil evaporation will be limited by the soil moisture content and be exponentially related to the soil layer thickness. The crop transpiration calculation is similar to the soil evaporation calculation, and is exponentially related to crop depth.
