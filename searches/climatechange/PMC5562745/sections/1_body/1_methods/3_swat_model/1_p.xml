<p id="Par9" class="p">The SWAT model is hydrologic response unit-based (HRU). The basic calculation unit (HRU) is formed by dividing the watershed into 31 sub-basins based on the digital elevation model (DEM) and the distribution of stream channels, and further subdividing into 327 HRUs based on soil and land use characteristics. In each HRU, the water balance equation is used to describe the land surface hydrological cycle, and the responses of each HRU in terms of water, sediment, and nutrient are computed individually. The components are aggregated at the sub-basin level and routed to the catchment outlet through the river channel network. Hydrological response variables such as potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration, and other variables, can also be obtained during the model calculation process. A more detailed description of the SWAT model is given by Arnold
