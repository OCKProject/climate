<p id="Par12" class="p">Sensitivity analysis and calibration were performed on each sub-basin. The river flow is greatly affected by human activity: river water is mainly used for crop consumption (ET). Irrigation results in ET, so the ET data were selected as the objectives for parameter estimation. ET data for the period 2000–2013, which were derived from the ETWatch model

 </sup> with a resolution of 1 km, were obtained from the Data Management Center of the Heihe Research Program (

The data were aggregated into the SWAT model at the sub-basin scale as the observed data. Eddy covariance (EC) observations from two ground observation stations in the Heihe River basin (the Arou station and the Yingke station) were used for the verification of remotely-sensed ET data, and the observed daily values of ET for 2008 were compared with ET values estimated by the ETWatch model. The Yingke station is in an agricultural oasis typical of the basin. The terrain is very flat and the main crop is corn. For the Yingke oasis plain area, the coefficient of determination (

 </sup>. The monthly ET value of the 31 sub-basins was first calculated using the Zonal toolset of ArcGIS. A two-year period was used to warm up the SWAT model for both the sensitivity analysis and calibration.
