 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table" class="xref">3</xref> gives the values of the coefficients of correlation between ET per unit area and its driving factors, and between total ET and its driving factors. The results show that ET per unit area was positively correlated with the following: the ratio of the area of grain crops to the area of cash crops; the ratio of the irrigated area to the cultivated area; fertilizer usage per unit area; plastic film mulch usage per unit area; and precipitation. ET per unit area was negatively correlated with the irrigation quota and with relative humidity. There was no significant correlation with solar radiation, average temperature, or wind speed. Total ET was positively correlated with the following: the ratio of the area of grain crops to the area of cash crops; cultivated area; irrigation area; total fertilizer usage; total plastic film mulch usage; and wind speed. Total ET was negatively correlated with the irrigation quota and with relative humidity. There was no significant correlation between total ET and average temperature, precipitation, or solar radiation.
