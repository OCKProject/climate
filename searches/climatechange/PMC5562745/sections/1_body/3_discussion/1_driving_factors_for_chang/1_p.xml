<p id="Par22" class="p">The average annual ET per unit area derived from the SWAT model in the Heihe agricultural region was 442.1 mm for the period 1984–2014. The maximum value was 496.62 mm, in 2002, and the minimum value was 383.81 mm, in 1984, as shown in Figs 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" class="xref">5</xref>. The ratio of the maximum ET value to the minimum ET value was 1.29, and the coefficient of variation was 0.06. These two values show that the inter-annual fluctuation of ET was relatively small. There was a slight increasing trend of ET per unit area during the 31-year period, with the trend coefficient |

 <sub class="sub">0.05</sub>. ET per unit area represents water consumption intensity. It is determined mainly by local meteorological factors and by irrigation water usage (the irrigation quota). ET per unit area is also influenced by other factors, such as the crop planting structure and water-saving irrigation measures. These influences are dynamic and change from year to year, so an interannual fluctuation in ET per unit area is to be expected. The average annual total ET was 3.89 × 10

The increase in total ET was more noticeable after 2010. This increase was mainly due to the rapid expansion in the area of land under cultivation after 2010
