<p id="Par31" class="p">Overall, the results suggest that both climatic and human activity factors are influential as driving mechanisms of ET change in the Heihe agricultural region. However, there are still some uncertainties and more in-depth analysis is necessary. For example, the SWAT model did not take into account any effects of land use change during the period of ET simulation. Only one land use map was used, because limited data was available, although the area of land used for cultivation in the region has been increasing since 2000

 </sup>. There may be data errors, such as inaccurate irrigation schedules in the statistical yearbooks. Lack of accurate irrigation data may mean that some sub-basins (those in which mainly vegetables, cotton and other crops are planted) are not properly represented in the model. A too-low irrigation quantity will cause ET to be underestimated. This error in ET estimation will have an impact on the subsequent analysis and selection of the main driving factors, which will in turn further affect the accuracy of the contribution rates.
