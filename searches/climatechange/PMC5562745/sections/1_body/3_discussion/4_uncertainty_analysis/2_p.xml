<p id="Par32" class="p">Any inaccuracy in the driving variables will also affect the estimation of the influence of the factors. For example, there are few meteorological stations within and around the Heihe agricultural region. Thus data for climate variables in any sub-basin will have some degree of inaccuracy due to the distance from the point of data collection. Inaccurate data may affect the results of correlation analysis and subsequent calculations of factor influence and contribution rates. The data for the agronomic and irrigation factors are obtained from the statistical yearbooks. If there are errors in the yearbooks (however caused), the selected driving factors will not be realistic. The resulting contribution rate calculations will be inaccurate.</p>
