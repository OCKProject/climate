<p id="Par33" class="p">Calculation of the contribution rates of the driving factors of change in ET involves uncertainty. For example, the driving factors of change in ET per unit area are not consistent with those for change in total ET. A limitation of factor analysis is that the driving factors are not independent, they may interact with each other and changes in one factor can cause changes in other factors. ET is a very complex process but this study analyzed only the major factors which influence it (human activity and climate change). Other influential factors, such as changes in crop varieties or in groundwater extraction, which are difficult to quantify and require a more comprehensive model, were not considered. The results would probably have been different when we included these elements in the factor analysis in order to calculate their contribution rate.</p>
