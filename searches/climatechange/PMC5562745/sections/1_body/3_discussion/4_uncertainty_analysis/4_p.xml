<p id="Par34" class="p">Global warming and human agricultural activities are both changing the agricultural environment in the Heihe agricultural region. Quantifying these changes will lead to a better understanding of the behaviour of ET, and the factors that influence it, within the regional water cycle. Increased understanding of ET will enable us to develop better decision support systems to manage water consumption in response to these changes. This study, despite the uncertainties we have identified, provides valuable reference information to facilitate the creation of appropriate management measures. Water is a scarce agricultural resource in the Heihe River basin so we must promote water usage efficiency. Knowledge of the factors which influence ET and how they do so will enable us to maintain the productivity of the agricultural ecosystem.</p>
