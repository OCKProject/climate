<p id="Par30" class="p">The human activity factors were the main driving force of change in total ET. This result is consistent with the identification of the driving forces of change in ET per unit area. The relative contribution of the climate factor to change in total ET (relative humidity and wind speed) was 7.67% greater than its influence on the change in ET per unit area. This result indicates that climate change is a more significant contributor to change in total ET than to change on ET per unit area. The contribution of human activity to changes in total ET still predominates, which is consistent with the corresponding result for change in ET per unit area. The area under cultivation shows an increasing trend in ET, which is more evident after 2010, although there is limited precipitation in the region. Irrigation is necessary to supply water to crops, and the cultivated area being irrigated also showed an increasing trend in ET. Increased use of chemical fertilizer and of plastic film mulch promotes crop growth, so these two crop management activities (constituents of the agronomy factor) become the main driving forces which influence the change in total ET. Some meteorological influences clearly changed inter-annually (wind speed, relative humidity). Other meteorological influences which also provide energy for ET to occur (average temperature, solar radiation) showed little inter-annual change. We conclude that the contribution of human agricultural management activity to total ET change in the 31-year period was greater than that of climate change.</p>
