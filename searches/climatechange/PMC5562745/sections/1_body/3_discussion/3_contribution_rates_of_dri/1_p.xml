 </sup>. The Bartlett’s sphericity test value was 274.189, and the P value was &lt;0.001. Both the KMO test and Bartlett’s sphericity test demonstrate the suitability of the data for factor analysis. The results of the factor analysis are given in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table" class="xref">6</xref>. The first common factor is composed of the following: the ratio of the area of grain crops to the area of cash crops; the total cultivated area; total fertilizer usage; and total plastic film mulch usage. The factor load values were 0.759, 0.941, 0.857, and 0.831, respectively. The first common factor is the agronomy factor, and its factor contribution rate is 43.61%; the second common factor, the irrigation factor, consists of the irrigation quota and the irrigation area. Its contribution rate is 10.25%. The contribution rate of human agricultural management activity to change in total ET is the sum of the contribution rates of the agronomy factor and the irrigation factor, 53.86%. The contribution rate of the third common factor, the climate factor, is 35.68%, and the factor load values of relative humidity and wind speed are −0.709 and 0.857, respectively.
