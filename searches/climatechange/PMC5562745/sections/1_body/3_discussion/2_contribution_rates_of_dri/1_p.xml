 </sup> to see whether the indicators of change in ET per unit area were suitable for factor analysis. The KMO test examines partial correlation between variables to show that there is no significant difference in the degree of correlation between variables. The KMO value was 0.743, which satisfied the minimal requirement of being &gt;0.5

 </sup>. Bartlett’s sphericity test was used to check whether the correlation array was a unit array, that is, whether the variables were independent. The results show that the Bartlett’s sphericity test value was 139.356, the degree of freedom was 36, and the P value was 0, which satisfies the requirement that P &lt; 0.001. The unit matrix assumption was not established, and met the prerequisites for extracting common factors. Based on the two sets of test results, the data is suitable for factor analysis.
