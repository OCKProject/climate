<p id="Par27" class="p">The results of the factor analysis are given in Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table" class="xref">4</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table" class="xref">5</xref>. The results show that the first common factor is composed of the following: the ratio of the area of grain crops to the area of cash crops; the ratio of the irrigated area to the cultivated area; fertilizer usage per unit area; and plastic film mulch usage per unit area. This is the agronomy factor. The factor contribution rate of the agronomy factor is 43.24%. The second common factor, the irrigation factor, is composed of the irrigation quota, with a factor load 0.707 and contribution rate of 17.69%. The contribution rate of human agricultural activities to the increase in ET per unit area is the sum of the agronomy factor and the irrigation factor, 60.93%. The contribution rate of the third common factor, the climate factor, is 28.01%. The factor loads of precipitation and relative humidity are 0.695 and −0.764, respectively. The climate factor represents the contribution rate of climate change (measured as precipitation and relative humidity) to change in ET per unit area.
