<p id="Par28" class="p">The main driving factor of change in ET per unit area in the Heihe agricultural region is the agronomy factor. The irrigation factor (which reflects the level of water saving in the region) also has a significant influence on the change in ET per unit area. This result indicates that the influence of water saving measures on agricultural ET cannot be neglected. The climate factor also influences changes in ET. However, human agricultural management activity has a greater effect on change in ET per unit area than climate change has. The region studied typifies agricultural irrigation use because of limited regional water resources. Water used for irrigation is mainly consumed through ET. Agronomic measures, such as the use of chemical fertilizers, plastic film mulch, and water-saving irrigation, significantly promote the growth of crops

 </sup>. Average temperature and solar radiation have been comparatively stable over the 31-year period. The relative contribution of human agricultural management activity to change in ET per unit area was much larger than that of the climate variables. Thus human activity is the main driving factor of change in ET per unit area.
