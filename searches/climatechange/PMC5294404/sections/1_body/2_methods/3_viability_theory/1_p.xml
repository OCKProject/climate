 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33" class="xref">33</xref> aims to preserve some set of desired properties (denoted by 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>) of a dynamical system. In the viability framework, controls are explicit expressed in the dynamics and not fixed beforehand. Instead, the goal is to find relevant management strategies (not necessarily “optimal” according to a certain criterion) that will maintain the system within its state constraint set 
 <italic class="italic">K</italic>. In discrete time, this means that at each time step, there is a set of possible controls that one must choose from. Defining the state of the system as a vector
